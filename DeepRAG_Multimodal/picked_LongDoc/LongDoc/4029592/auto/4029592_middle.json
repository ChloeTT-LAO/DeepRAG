Answer: True faith is a sure knowledge whereby I accept as true all that God has revealed to us in His Word1. At the same time it is a firm confidence2 that not only to others, but also to me3, God has granted forgiveness of sins, everlasting righteousness, and salvation4, out of mere grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits5.

With respect to His human nature He is no longer on earth2, but with respect to His divinity, majesty, grace, and Spirit He is never absent from us3. 1Matthew 28:20. 2Matthew 26:11; John 16:28; John 17:11; Acts 3:21; Hebrews 8:4. 3Matthew 28:20; John 14:16-18.</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>Question: But are the two natures in Christ not separated from each other if His human nature is not present wherever His divinity is? Answer: Not at all, for His divinity has no limits and is present everywhere1. So it must follow that His divinity is indeed beyond the human nature which He has taken on and nevertheless is within this human nature and remains personally united with it2. 1Jeremiah 23:24; Acts 7:49. 2Matthew 28:6; John 3:13; John 11:15; Colossians 2:9.</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>Question: How does Christ's ascension into heaven benefit us? Answer: First, He is our Advocate in heaven before His Father1. Second, we have our flesh in heaven as a sure pledge that He, our Head, will also take us, His members, up to Himself2. Third, He sends us His Spirit as a counter-pledge3, by whose power we seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God, and not the things that are on earth4. 1Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1. 2John 14:2; John 17:24; Ephesians 2:6. 3 John 14:16; John 16:7; Acts 2:33; 2 Corinthians 1:22; 2 Corinthians 5:5. 4 Colossians 3:1; Philippians 3:20.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

Answer: From the Holy Spirit, who works it in our hearts1 by the preaching of the gospel, and strengthens it by the use of the sacraments2. 1 John 3:5; Ephesians 2:8; Ephesians 6:23; 1 Corinthians 2:12; 1 Corinthians 12:3; Philipians 1:29. 2Matthew 28:19; Romans 10:17; Ephesians 1:17-18; 1 Peter 1:22-23.</td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>Question: What are the sacraments? Answer: The sacraments are holy, visible signs and seals. They were instituted by God so that by their use He might the more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel. And this is the promise: that God graciously grants us forgiveness of sins and everlasting life because of the one sacrifice of Christ accomplished on the cross1. 1 Genesis 17:11; Leviticus 6:25; Deuteronomy 30:6; Isaiah 6:6-7; Isaiah 54:9; Ezekiel 20:12; Romans 4:11; Hebrews 9:7-9; Hebrews 9:24.</td></tr><tr><td>67</td><td>Question: Are both the Word and the sacraments then intended to focus our faith on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross as the only ground of our salvation? Answer: Yes, indeed. The Holy Spirit teaches us in the gospel and assures us by the sacraments that our entire salvation rests on Christ's one sacrifice for us on the cross1.</td></tr><tr><td>68</td><td>1Romans 6:3; Galatians 3:27.

Answer: God speaks in this way for a good reason. He wants to teach us that the blood and Spirit of Christ remove our sins just as water takes away dirt from the body1. But, even more important, He wants to assure us by this divine pledge and sign that we are as truly cleansed from our sins spiritually as we are bodily washed with water2. 1 1 Corinthians 6:11; Revelation 1:5; Revelation 7:14. 2Mark 16:16; Galatians 3:27.

Through Christ's blood the redemption from sin and the Holy Spirit, who works faith, are promised to them no less than to adults2. Therefore, by baptism, as sign of the covenant, they must be grafted into the Christian church and distinguished from the children of unbelievers3. This was done in the old covenant by circumcision4, in place of which baptism was instituted in the new covenant5. 1 Genesis 17:7. 2 Psalms 22:10; Isaiah 44:1-3; Matthew 19:14; Luke 1:15; Acts 2:39. 3 Acts 10:47. 4 Genesis 17:14. 5 Colossians 2:11-13.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

Answer: In this way: Christ has commanded me and all believers to eat of this broken bread and drink of this cup in remembrance of Him. With this command He gave these promises1: First, as surely as I see with my eyes the bread of the Lord broken for me and the cup given to me, so surely was His body offered for me and His blood poured out for me on the cross. Second, as surely as I receive from the hand of the minister and taste with my mouth the bread and the cup of the Lord as sure signs of Christ's body and blood, so surely does He Himself nourish and refresh my soul to everlasting life with His crucified body and shed blood. 1Matthew 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 10:16-17; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25; 1 Corinthians 12:13.</td></tr><tr><td>76</td><td>Question: What does it mean to eat the crucified body of Christ and to drink His shed blood? Answer: First, to accept with a believing heart all the suffering and the death of Christ, and so receive forgiveness of sins and life eternal1. Second, to be united more and more to His sacred body through the Holy Spirit, who lives both in Christ and in us2. Therefore, although Christ is in heaven? and we are on earth, yet we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones4, and we forever live and are governed by one Spirit, as the members of our body are by one soul5. 1John 6:35; John 6:40; John 6:47-54. 2 John 6:55-56. 3 Acts 1:9-11; Acts 3:21; 1 Corinthians 11:26; Colossians 3:1. 4 1 Corinthians 6:15; Ephesians 3:16; Ephesians 5:29-30; 1 John 3:24; 1 John 4:13. 5 John 6:57; John 15:1-6; Ephesians 4:15-16.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

Answer: In this way: Christ has commanded me and all believers to eat of this broken bread and drink of this cup in remembrance of Him. With this command He gave these promises1: First, as surely as I see with my eyes the bread of the Lord broken for me and the cup given to me, so surely was His body offered for me and His blood poured out for me on the cross. Second, as surely as I receive from the hand of the minister and taste with my mouth the bread and the cup of the Lord as sure signs of Christ's body and blood, so surely does He Himself nourish and refresh my soul to everlasting life with His crucified body and shed blood. 1Matthew 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 10:16-17; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25; 1 Corinthians 12:13.</td></tr><tr><td>76</td><td>Question: What does it mean to eat the crucified body of Christ and to drink His shed blood? Answer: First, to accept with a believing heart all the suffering and the death of Christ, and so receive forgiveness of sins and life eternal1. Second, to be united more and more to His sacred body through the Holy Spirit, who lives both in Christ and in us2. Therefore, although Christ is in heaven? and we are on earth, yet we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones4, and we forever live and are governed by one Spirit, as the members of our body are by one soul5. 1John 6:35; John 6:40; John 6:47-54. 2 John 6:55-56. 3 Acts 1:9-11; Acts 3:21; 1 Corinthians 11:26; Colossians 3:1. 4 1 Corinthians 6:15; Ephesians 3:16; Ephesians 5:29-30; 1 John 3:24; 1 John 4:13. 5 John 6:57; John 15:1-6; Ephesians 4:15-16.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

Do this in memory of me'. In the same way, after the supper he took the cup and said, 'This cup is God's new covenant, sealed with my blood. Whenever you drink it, do so in memory of me.

Answer: No1. Just as the water of baptism is not changed into the blood of Christ and is not the washing away of sins itself but is simply God's sign and pledge2, so also the bread in the Lord's supper does not become the body of Christ itself, although it is called Christ's body3 in keeping with the nature and usage of sacraments4. 1Matthew 26:29. 2 Ephesians5:26;Titus3:5. 3 1 Corinthians 10:16-17; 1 Corinthians 11:26.</td></tr><tr><td>79</td><td>4 Genesis 17:10-11; Exodus 12:11; Exodus 12:13; Exodus 13:9; 1 Corinthians 10:3-4; 1 Peter 3:21. Question: Why then does Christ call the bread His body and the cup His blood, or the new covenant in His blood, and why does Paul speak of a participation in the body and blood of Christ? Answer: Christ speaks in this way for a good reason: He wants to teach us by His supper that as bread and wine sustain us in this temporal life, so His crucified body and shed blood are true food and drink for our souls to eternal life1. But, even more important, He wants to assure us by this visible sign and pledge, first, that through the working of the Holy Spirit we share in His true body and blood as surely as we receive with our mouth these holy signs in remembrance of Him, and, second, that all His suffering and obedience are as certainly ours as if we personally had suffered and paid for our sins2.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

Answer: No1. Just as the water of baptism is not changed into the blood of Christ and is not the washing away of sins itself but is simply God's sign and pledge2, so also the bread in the Lord's supper does not become the body of Christ itself, although it is called Christ's body3 in keeping with the nature and usage of sacraments4. 1Matthew 26:29. 2 Ephesians5:26;Titus3:5. 3 1 Corinthians 10:16-17; 1 Corinthians 11:26.</td></tr><tr><td>79</td><td>4 Genesis 17:10-11; Exodus 12:11; Exodus 12:13; Exodus 13:9; 1 Corinthians 10:3-4; 1 Peter 3:21. Question: Why then does Christ call the bread His body and the cup His blood, or the new covenant in His blood, and why does Paul speak of a participation in the body and blood of Christ? Answer: Christ speaks in this way for a good reason: He wants to teach us by His supper that as bread and wine sustain us in this temporal life, so His crucified body and shed blood are true food and drink for our souls to eternal life1. But, even more important, He wants to assure us by this visible sign and pledge, first, that through the working of the Holy Spirit we share in His true body and blood as surely as we receive with our mouth these holy signs in remembrance of Him, and, second, that all His suffering and obedience are as certainly ours as if we personally had suffered and paid for our sins2.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

But the mass teaches, first, that the living and the dead do not have forgiveness of sins through the suffering of Christ unless He is still offered for them daily by the priests; and, second, that Christ is bodily present in the form of bread and wine, and there is to be worshipped. Therefore the mass is basically nothing but a denial of the one sacrifice and suffering of Jesus Christ, and an accursed idolatry5. 1Matthew 26:28; Luke 22:19-20; John 19:30; Hebrews 7:26-27; Hebrews 9:12; Hebrews 9:24-28; Hebrews 10:10; Hebrews 10:12; Hebrews 10:14. 2 1 Corinthians 6:17; 1 Corinthians 10:16-17. 3 John 20:17; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 8:1 4 Acts 7:55; Philippians 3:20; Colossians 3:1; 1 Thessalonians 1:10. 5 Hebrews 9:26; Hebrews 10:12; Hebrews 10:14.</td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td>Question: Who are to come to the table of the Lord?

If they do not heed also their admonitions, they are forbidden the use of the sacraments, and they are excluded by the elders from the Christian congregation, and by God Himself from the kingdom of Christ. They are again received as members of Christ and of the church when they promise and show real amendment. 1 Matthew 18:15-18; 1 Corinthians 5:4-5; 1 Corinthians 5:11; 2 Corinthians 2:6- 8; 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15; 2 John 10-11.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

If they do not heed also their admonitions, they are forbidden the use of the sacraments, and they are excluded by the elders from the Christian congregation, and by God Himself from the kingdom of Christ. They are again received as members of Christ and of the church when they promise and show real amendment. 1 Matthew 18:15-18; 1 Corinthians 5:4-5; 1 Corinthians 5:11; 2 Corinthians 2:6- 8; 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15; 2 John 10-11.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

The kingdom of heaven is closed when it is proclaimed and testified to all unbelievers and hypocrites that the wrath of God and eternal condemnation rest on them as long as they do not repent. According to this testimony of the gospel, God will judge both in this life and in the life to come1. 1Matthew 16:19; John 20:21-23.</td></tr><tr><td>85</td><td>Question: How is the kingdom of heaven closed and opened by church discipline?

Answer: Because Christ, having redeemed us by His blood, also renews us by His Holy Spirit to be His image1, so that with our whole life we may show ourselves thankful to God for His benefits, and He may be praised by us2. Further, that we ourselves may be assured of our faith by its fruits3, and that by our godly walk of life we may win our neighbours for Christ4. 1 Romans 6:13; Romans 12:1-2; 1 Corinthians 6:20; 1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:9. 2 Matthew 5:16; 1 Peter 2:12. 3 Matthew 7:17; Galatians 5:6; Galatians 5:22; 2 Peter 1:10. 4 Romans 14:19; 1 Peter 3:1-2.</td></tr><tr><td>87</td><td>Question: Can those be saved who do not turn to God from their ungrateful and impenitent walk of life?

That is why He commanded it to be punished with death2. 1 Leviticus 5:1; Proverbs 29:24. 2 Leviticus 24:16.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

Answer: Yes, when the government demands it of its subjects, or when necessity requires it, in order to maintain and promote fidelity and truth, to God's glory and for our neighbour's good. Such oath-taking is based on God's Word1 and was therefore rightly used by saints in the Old and the New Testament2. 1Deuteronomy 6:13; Deuteronomy 10:20; Hebrews 6:16. 2 Genesis 21:24; Genesis 31:53; Joshua 9:15; 1 Samuel 24:22; 2 Samuel 3:35; 1 Kings 1:29-30; Romans 1:9; Romans 9:1; 2 Corinthians 1:23.</td></tr><tr><td>102</td><td>Question: May we also swear by saints or other creatures?

Moreover, I am not to harm or recklessly endanger myself3.

Second, that we may be zealous for good deeds and constantly pray to God for the grace of the Holy Spirit, that He may more and more renew us after God's image, until after this life we reach the goal of perfection3. 1Psalms 32:5; Romans 3:20; 1 John 1:9. 2 Matthew 5:6;Romans 7:24-25. 3 1 Corinthians 9:24;Philippians 3:12-14.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

Answer: No. In this life even the holiest have only a small beginning of this obedience1. Nevertheless, with earnest purpose they do begin to live not only according to some but to all the commandments of God2. 1Prediker 7:20; Romans 7:14-15; 1 Corinthians 13:9; 1 John 1:8; 1 John 1:10. 2Psalms 1:2; Romans 7:22; 1 John 2:3.</td></tr><tr><td>115</td><td>Question: If in this life no one can keep the ten commandments perfectly, why does God have them preached so strictly?

Second, that we may be zealous for good deeds and constantly pray to God for the grace of the Holy Spirit, that He may more and more renew us after God's image, until after this life we reach the goal of perfection3. 1Psalms 32:5; Romans 3:20; 1 John 1:9. 2 Matthew 5:6;Romans 7:24-25. 3 1 Corinthians 9:24;Philippians 3:12-14.</td></tr></table></body></html>",

Answer: Because prayer is the most important part of the thankfulness which God requires of us1. Moreover, God will give His grace and the Holy Spirit only to those who constantly and with heartfelt longing ask Him for these gifts and thank Him for them2. 1Psalms 50:14-15. 2 Matthew 7:7-8; Luke 11:9-10; Luke 11:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18.</td></tr><tr><td>117</td><td>Question: What belongs to a prayer which pleases God and is heard by Him? Answer: First, we must from the heart call upon1 the one true God only2, who has revealed Himself in His Word, for all that He has commanded us to pray3. Second, we must thoroughly know our need and misery4, so that we may humble ourselves before God5. Third, we must rest on this firm foundation6 that, although we do not deserve it, God will certainly hear our prayer for the sake of Christ our Lord', as He has promised us in His Word8. 1Psalms 145:18; John 4:24. 2 John 4:22-24; Revelation 19:10. 3 Romans 8:26; James 1:5; 1 John 5:14. 4 2 Chronicles 20:12; Psalms 143:2. 5 Psalms 2:11; Psalms 34:18; Psalms 62:8; Isaiah 66:2. 6 Romans 8:15-17;Romans 10:14; James 1:6. 7 Daniel 9:17-19; John 14:13-14; John 15:16; John 16:23.</td></tr><tr><td>118</td><td>8 Psalms 27:8; Psalms 143:1; Matthew 7:8.

Answer: Because prayer is the most important part of the thankfulness which God requires of us1. Moreover, God will give His grace and the Holy Spirit only to those who constantly and with heartfelt longing ask Him for these gifts and thank Him for them2. 1Psalms 50:14-15. 2 Matthew 7:7-8; Luke 11:9-10; Luke 11:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18.</td></tr><tr><td>117</td><td>Question: What belongs to a prayer which pleases God and is heard by Him? Answer: First, we must from the heart call upon1 the one true God only2, who has revealed Himself in His Word, for all that He has commanded us to pray3. Second, we must thoroughly know our need and misery4, so that we may humble ourselves before God5. Third, we must rest on this firm foundation6 that, although we do not deserve it, God will certainly hear our prayer for the sake of Christ our Lord', as He has promised us in His Word8. 1Psalms 145:18; John 4:24. 2 John 4:22-24; Revelation 19:10. 3 Romans 8:26; James 1:5; 1 John 5:14. 4 2 Chronicles 20:12; Psalms 143:2. 5 Psalms 2:11; Psalms 34:18; Psalms 62:8; Isaiah 66:2. 6 Romans 8:15-17;Romans 10:14; James 1:6. 7 Daniel 9:17-19; John 14:13-14; John 15:16; John 16:23.</td></tr><tr><td>118</td><td>8 Psalms 27:8; Psalms 143:1; Matthew 7:8.

Moreover, our sworn enemies-- the devil2, the world3, and our own flesh4-- do not cease to attack us. Wilt Thou, therefore, uphold and strengthen us by the power of Thy Holy Spirit, so that in this spiritual war we may not go down to defeat, but always firmly resist our enemies5, until we finally obtain the complete victory6. 1 Psalms 103:14-16; John 15:5. 2 Ephesians 6:12; 1 Peter 5:8. 3 John 15:19. 4 Romans 7:23; Galatians 5:17. 5 Matthew 26:41; Mark 13:33; 1 Corinthians 10:12-13.</td><td></td><td rowspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>128</td><td>6 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:23.
