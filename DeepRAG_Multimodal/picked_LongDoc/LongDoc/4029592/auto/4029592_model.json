With respect to His human nature He is no longer on earth2, but with respect to His divinity, majesty, grace, and Spirit He is never absent from us3. 1Matthew 28:20. 2Matthew 26:11; John 16:28; John 17:11; Acts 3:21; Hebrews 8:4. 3Matthew 28:20; John 14:16-18.</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>Question: But are the two natures in Christ not separated from each other if His human nature is not present wherever His divinity is? Answer: Not at all, for His divinity has no limits and is present everywhere1. So it must follow that His divinity is indeed beyond the human nature which He has taken on and nevertheless is within this human nature and remains personally united with it2. 1Jeremiah 23:24; Acts 7:49. 2Matthew 28:6; John 3:13; John 11:15; Colossians 2:9.</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>Question: How does Christ's ascension into heaven benefit us?

Third, He sends us His Spirit as a counter-pledge3, by whose power we seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God, and not the things that are on earth4. 1Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1. 2John 14:2; John 17:24; Ephesians 2:6. 3 John 14:16; John 16:7; Acts 2:33; 2 Corinthians 1:22; 2 Corinthians 5:5. 4 Colossians 3:1; Philippians 3:20.</td></tr></table></body></html>"

Answer: In this way: Christ has commanded me and all believers to eat of this broken bread and drink of this cup in remembrance of Him. With this command He gave these promises1: First, as surely as I see with my eyes the bread of the Lord broken for me and the cup given to me, so surely was His body offered for me and His blood poured out for me on the cross. Second, as surely as I receive from the hand of the minister and taste with my mouth the bread and the cup of the Lord as sure signs of Christ's body and blood, so surely does He Himself nourish and refresh my soul to everlasting life with His crucified body and shed blood. 1Matthew 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 10:16-17; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25; 1 Corinthians 12:13.</td></tr><tr><td>76</td><td>Question: What does it mean to eat the crucified body of Christ and to drink His shed blood? Answer: First, to accept with a believing heart all the suffering and the death of Christ, and so receive forgiveness of sins and life eternal1. Second, to be united more and more to His sacred body through the Holy Spirit, who lives both in Christ and in us2. Therefore, although Christ is in heaven? and we are on earth, yet we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones4, and we forever live and are governed by one Spirit, as the members of our body are by one soul5. 1John 6:35; John 6:40; John 6:47-54. 2 John 6:55-56. 3 Acts 1:9-11; Acts 3:21; 1 Corinthians 11:26; Colossians 3:1. 4 1 Corinthians 6:15; Ephesians 3:16; Ephesians 5:29-30; 1 John 3:24; 1 John 4:13. 5 John 6:57; John 15:1-6; Ephesians 4:15-16.</td></tr></table></body></html>"

Answer: No1. Just as the water of baptism is not changed into the blood of Christ and is not the washing away of sins itself but is simply God's sign and pledge2, so also the bread in the Lord's supper does not become the body of Christ itself, although it is called Christ's body3 in keeping with the nature and usage of sacraments4. 1Matthew 26:29. 2 Ephesians5:26;Titus3:5. 3 1 Corinthians 10:16-17; 1 Corinthians 11:26.</td></tr><tr><td>79</td><td>4 Genesis 17:10-11; Exodus 12:11; Exodus 12:13; Exodus 13:9; 1 Corinthians 10:3-4; 1 Peter 3:21. Question: Why then does Christ call the bread His body and the cup His blood, or the new covenant in His blood, and why does Paul speak of a participation in the body and blood of Christ? Answer: Christ speaks in this way for a good reason: He wants to teach us by His supper that as bread and wine sustain us in this temporal life, so His crucified body and shed blood are true food and drink for our souls to eternal life1. But, even more important, He wants to assure us by this visible sign and pledge, first, that through the working of the Holy Spirit we share in His true body and blood as surely as we receive with our mouth these holy signs in remembrance of Him, and, second, that all His suffering and obedience are as certainly ours as if we personally had suffered and paid for our sins2.</td></tr></table></body></html>"

Answer: Yes, when the government demands it of its subjects, or when necessity requires it, in order to maintain and promote fidelity and truth, to God's glory and for our neighbour's good. Such oath-taking is based on God's Word1 and was therefore rightly used by saints in the Old and the New Testament2. 1Deuteronomy 6:13; Deuteronomy 10:20; Hebrews 6:16. 2 Genesis 21:24; Genesis 31:53; Joshua 9:15; 1 Samuel 24:22; 2 Samuel 3:35; 1 Kings 1:29-30; Romans 1:9; Romans 9:1; 2 Corinthians 1:23.</td></tr><tr><td>102</td><td>Question: May we also swear by saints or other creatures?

Answer: Because prayer is the most important part of the thankfulness which God requires of us1. Moreover, God will give His grace and the Holy Spirit only to those who constantly and with heartfelt longing ask Him for these gifts and thank Him for them2. 1Psalms 50:14-15. 2 Matthew 7:7-8; Luke 11:9-10; Luke 11:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18.</td></tr><tr><td>117</td><td>Question: What belongs to a prayer which pleases God and is heard by Him? Answer: First, we must from the heart call upon1 the one true God only2, who has revealed Himself in His Word, for all that He has commanded us to pray3. Second, we must thoroughly know our need and misery4, so that we may humble ourselves before God5. Third, we must rest on this firm foundation6 that, although we do not deserve it, God will certainly hear our prayer for the sake of Christ our Lord', as He has promised us in His Word8. 1Psalms 145:18; John 4:24. 2 John 4:22-24; Revelation 19:10. 3 Romans 8:26; James 1:5; 1 John 5:14. 4 2 Chronicles 20:12; Psalms 143:2. 5 Psalms 2:11; Psalms 34:18; Psalms 62:8; Isaiah 66:2. 6 Romans 8:15-17;Romans 10:14; James 1:6. 7 Daniel 9:17-19; John 14:13-14; John 15:16; John 16:23.</td></tr><tr><td>118</td><td>8 Psalms 27:8; Psalms 143:1; Matthew 7:8.
