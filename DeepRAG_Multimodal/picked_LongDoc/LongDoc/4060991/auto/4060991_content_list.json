This publication proposes a definition for human augmentation as: the application of science and technologies to temporarily or permanently improve human performance.  This field can be further divided into human performance optimisation and human performance enhancement.  Human performance optimisation is the use of science and technologies that improve human performance up to the limit of biological potential without adding new capabilities.  Human performance enhancement is the use of science and technologies to enhance human performance beyond the limit of biological potential and can include additional capabilities beyond those innate to humans (for example, night vision).

Equally, laser eye surgery is only 35 years old, more sophisticated and permanent, but in most cases only optimises sight up to the individual’s biological potential.  Permanence and degree of invasiveness are also important aspects of human augmentation and will be discussed later in this publication. Noting that night vision goggles and binoculars are technically included in the definition of human augmentation, this paper will focus mainly on the implications of novel science and technology that are more closely integrated with the human body.

Workshops were held in which human augmentation-related ideas were written on ‘sticky notes’ and clustered into factors according to perceived commonality.  The outcome of this process was a large number of initial factors that varied in nature and scope.  These factors were not necessarily independent, and in some cases had multiple, different meanings.  An example is the economy factor which originally referred to both revenue and cost, the former being a driver and the latter a consequence.  Potential relationships were identified using an approach inspired by systems engineering48 and used the doctrine, organisation, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF)49 framework to analyse the initial factors.

The foundation of a good team builds on communication (knowing how and when to communicate), team coordination (shared mental models, mutual performance monitoring, assistive behaviour and adaptability, and leadership), and cooperation (team orientation and mutual trust).95 ",
