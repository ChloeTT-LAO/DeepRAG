        "text": "We build a publicly available database that tracks economic activity at a granular level in real time using anonymized data from private companies. We report daily statistics on consumer spending, business revenues, employment rates, and other key indicators disaggregated by ZIP code, industry, income group, and business size. Using these data, we study how COVID-19 affected the economy by analyzing heterogeneity in its impacts. We first show that high-income individuals reduced spending sharply in mid-March 2020, particularly in areas with high rates of COVID-19 infection and in sectors that require in-person interaction. This reduction in spending greatly reduced the revenues of small businesses in affluent ZIP codes. These businesses laid off many of their employees, leading to widespread job losses especially among low-wage workers in affluent areas. High-wage workers experienced a “V-shaped” recession that lasted a few weeks, whereas low-wage workers experienced much larger job losses that persisted for several months. Building on this diagnostic analysis, we estimate the causal effects of policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19. State-ordered reopenings of economies had small impacts on spending and employment. Stimulus payments to low-income households increased consumer spending sharply, but little of this increased spending flowed to businesses most affected by the COVID-19 shock, dampening its impacts on employment. Paycheck Protection Program loans increased employment at small businesses by only $2\\%$ , implying a cost of $\\$377,000$ per job saved. These results suggest that traditional macroeconomic tools – stimulating aggregate demand or providing liquidity to businesses – have diminished capacity to restore employment when consumer spending is constrained by health concerns. During a pandemic, it may be more fruitful to mitigate economic hardship through social insurance. More broadly, this analysis shows how public statistics constructed from private sector data can support many research and policy analyses without compromising privacy, providing a new tool for empirical macroeconomics.

        "text": "Since Kuznets (1941), macroeconomic policy decisions have been made on the basis of publicly available statistics constructed from recurring surveys of households and businesses conducted by the federal government. Although such statistics have great value for understanding total economic activity, they have two limitations. First, survey-based data typically cannot be used to assess variation across geographies or subgroups; due to relatively small sample sizes, most statistics are typically reported only at the national or state level and breakdowns for demographic subgroups or sectors are unavailable. Second, such statistics are typically available only at low frequencies, often with a significant time lag. For example, data on consumer spending disaggregated by geography are only available for selected large metro areas at a bi-annual level in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). Because of these limitations, existing publicly available macroeconomic statistics are insufficient to study the sources of economic fluctuations and the causal impacts of macroeconomic policies. ",

First, we describe how we construct statistics on consumer spending, business revenues, employment rates, job postings, and other key indicators – disaggregated by area (ZIP code or county), industry, income level, and business size – by combining data from credit card processors, payroll firms, and financial services firms. The main challenge in using private sector data sources to measure economic activity is a tension between research value and privacy protection. For research, it is beneficial to use raw, disaggregated data – ideally down to the individual consumer or business level – to maximize precision and flexibility of research designs. But from a privacy perspective, it is preferable to aggregate and mask data to reduce the risk of disclosure of private information. To balance these conflicting interests, one must construct statistics that are sufficiently aggregated and masked to mitigate privacy concerns yet sufficiently granular to support research.1 ",

We then clean the raw data by removing data artifacts (e.g., breaks that arise from changes in platforms) and smoothing seasonal fluctuations. Finally, we address the challenge that statistics from specific private firms may not be representative of the population in general. To minimize potential selection biases, we start by obtaining data from companies that have large samples (e.g., at least one million individuals) and span well-defined sectors or subgroups (e.g., small businesses). We then compare each time series to publicly available benchmarks based on representative surveys and use only the series that track publicly available data closely.2 After establishing these protocols, we report the final statistics using an automated pipeline that ingests data from businesses and reports statistics within a week after the relevant transactions occur.

National accounts reveal that GDP fell in the second quarter of 2020 following the COVID-19 shock primarily because of a reduction in consumer spending. We therefore begin by examining the drivers of changes in consumer spending using credit and debit card data. We find that spending fell primarily because high-income households started spending much less. As of mid-July, 49% of the reduction in total spending since January came from households in the top income quartile, while 7% came from households in the bottom quartile.3 This is both because the rich account for a larger share of spending to begin with and because they cut spending more in percentage terms: top-quartile households spent $13\\%$ less as of mid-July than in January 2020, whereas bottom-quartile households spent only 4% less. Spending reductions were concentrated in services that require in-person physical interaction, such as hotels and restaurants, consistent with contemporaneous work by Alexander and Karger (2020) and Cox et al. (2020). These findings suggest that high-income households reduced spending primarily because of health concerns rather than a reduction in income or wealth, perhaps because they were able to self-isolate more easily than lower-income individuals (e.g., by substituting to remote work).

To do so, we exploit geographic variation in the demand shocks businesses face arising from the fact that inperson services are typically produced by small businesses (e.g., restaurants) that serve customers in their local area. Small business revenues in the highest-income and highest-rent ZIP codes (e.g., the Upper East Side of Manhattan) fell by more than $65\\%$ between March and mid-April, compared with 30% in the least affluent ZIP codes. These reductions in revenue resulted in a much higher rate of small business closure in affluent areas within a given county than in less affluent areas. This was particularly the case for non-tradable goods that require physical interaction – e.g., restaurants and accommodation services. Small businesses that provide fewer in-person services – such as financial or professional services firms – experienced much smaller losses in revenue even in affluent areas. ",

Building on results first established using other data sources by Cajner et al. (2020), we show that employment rates fell by 37% around the trough of the COVID recession (April 15, 2020) for workers with wages rates in the bottom quartile of the pre-COVID wage distribution. By contrast, employment rates fell by 14% for those in the top wage quartile. Employment for highwage workers also rebounded much more quickly: employment levels for workers in the top wage quartile were almost back to pre-COVID levels by the end of May, but remained 20% below baseline for low-wage workers even as of October 2020. The greater persistence of job losses for low-wage workers is not explained purely by sectoral differences. Even in sectors where spending rebounded to baseline levels, such as retail trade, employment of low-wage workers remained far below baseline levels, suggesting that economic activity may have shifted toward modes of production using less low-wage labor (Jaimovich and Siu 2020).

Job postings also fell much more sharply in more affluent areas, particularly for positions requiring less education. As a result, unemployment rates surged even in affluent areas that have typically had relatively low unemployment rates in previous recessions. The impacts on displaced workers persist over time: low-income people working in more affluent ZIP codes pre-COVID (e.g., Manhattan) remain less likely to be employed months after losing their jobs and reduce their own spending levels more sharply than their peers working in nearby less affluent areas (e.g., the Bronx).

Spending and employment also fell well before state-level shutdowns were implemented, consistent with other recent work examining data on hours of work and movement patterns (Bartik et al. 2020, Villas-Boas et al. 2020). Hence, differences in shutdown orders explain very little of the cross-state variation in spending and employment trends, consistent with the findings of Goolsbee and Syverson (2020) from cell phone location data.

(2020) and models of consumption that generate excess sensitivity (e.g., Kaplan and Violante 2014). However, most of this increase in spending was in sectors that require limited physical interaction: purchases of durable goods surged, while consumption of in-person services increased much less. As a result, little of the increased spending flowed to businesses most affected by the COVID-19 shock, potentially limiting the capacity of the stimulus to increase economic activity and employment because of diminished multiplier effects (a broken Keynesian cross), as discussed by Guerrieri et al. (2020). ",

Our point estimates imply that the cost per job saved by the PPP was \\$377,000 (\\$119,000 at the lower bound of the $95\\%$ confidence interval). Contemporaneous studies by Granja et al. (2020), Autor et al. (2020), and Hubbard and Strain (2020) reach similar conclusions using other data sources and research designs. The PPP had modest marginal impacts on employment likely because the vast majority of PPP loans went to inframarginal firms that were not planning to lay off many workers. As a result, providing liquidity to firms is an expensive way to maintain employment rates in the short run, although it remains possible that the PPP may have long-term benefits by reducing permanent business closures.

Traditional macroeconomic tools – stimulating aggregate demand or providing liquidity to businesses – have diminished capacity to fully restore employment when demand is constrained by health concerns.5 In such a setting, it may be especially valuable to provide social insurance to reduce hardship for those who have lost their jobs, e.g., via unemployment benefit extensions (Guerrieri et al. 2020). In addition, it may be useful to target employment assistance to lowincome people who were working in places that suffered the largest job losses (such as affluent, urban areas), since geographic disparities in unemployment persist for many years due to limited migration (Blanchard and Katz 1992, Austin, Glaeser, and Summers 2018, Yagan 2019).

In the COVID-19 pandemic literature, several recent papers – whose results we compare to ours in the course of our analysis below – have used confidential private sector data to analyze consumer spending (e.g., Baker et al. 2020, Chen, Qian, and Wen 2020, Cox et al. 2020), business revenues (e.g., Alexander and Karger 2020), and labor market trends (e.g., Bartik et al. 2020, Cajner et al. 2020, Kurmann, Lal´e, and Ta 2020, Forsythe et al. 2020).

Other studies of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on one outcome (e.g., spending or employment or job postings) at broad geographies. By combining data sources on multiple outcomes at the ZIP code level, we exploit local geographic variation to provide an integrated picture of how COVID-19 affected the macroeconomy – from changes in consumer spending to in-person business revenue losses to employment changes and impacts on displaced workers. The heterogeneity in impacts we document across ZIP codes – which, to our knowledge, has not been analyzed in prior studies – provides a novel source of local variation to understand macroeconomic dynamics, similar to the geographic variation widely exploited to understand the Great Recession (e.g., Mian and Sufi 2009). In addition, analyzing a suite of outcomes allows us to characterize the impacts of major stabilization policies more fully, from changes in consumer behavior to impacts on businesses’ employment and hiring decisions.

Unlike the aforementioned studies of COVID-19, which use confidential microdata, the results reported here are all produced from what are now publicly available data. Where those studies overlap with ours, results from our public data are very similar to those obtained from their microdata. The capacity to use public data substantially expands the number of researchers who can conduct such studies and opens many new avenues for policy and research. For instance, policymakers could adjust policies as they observe their impacts on the economy (much as the Paycheck Protection Program was repeatedly adjusted, but without the benefit of evidence on its ongoing impacts). Moreover, such impacts can be analyzed heterogeneously across areas and subgroups, permitting tailored responses by local governments. In this sense, the data assembled here provide a prototype for a new system of real-time, granular national accounts that we hope will be refined in future work, much as Kuznets (1941) and Summers and Heston (1984, 1991) developed prototypes for national accounts that were refined in subsequent work (e.g., Feenstra, Inklaar, and Timmer 2015).

To assess the importance of such substitution, we examine cash purchases using receipts data from CoinOut. Appendix Figure 4a plots aggregate cash purchases in the CoinOut data vs. aggregate card spending at grocery stores over time.16 The time trends are very similar between the two series (with a signal correlation of 0.9 at the weekly level), showing a sharp spike in spending in late March (as households stocked up on groceries), followed by a more sustained increase in spending from the latter half of April. These results – together with the fact that our card spending series closely track estimates from the MARTS (Figures 1b and 1c) – indicate that aggregate fluctuations in card spending do not appear to have been offset by opposite-signed changes in cash spending. Rather, households shifted spending similarly across both modes of payment. We therefore proceed to focus on card spending in the rest of our analysis given the larger sample sizes and greater granularity of the card spending data. ",

Consistent with the findings of Cox et al. (2020), roughly two-thirds of the reduction in spending came from reduced spending on goods or services that require in-person contact (and thereby carry a risk of COVID infection), such as hotels, transportation, and food services. This is particularly striking given that these goods accounted for only one-third of total spending in January, as shown by the right bar in Figure 2b. Panel B of Table 1 shows that these gaps only grew larger as the pandemic progressed, as consumer spending increased above pre-pandemic levels for durable and non-durable goods by mid-July, but remained sharply depressed for in-person services.

Seasonally-adjusted spending on luxury goods such as installation of home pools and landscaping services – which do not require in-person contact – increased slightly after the COVID shock. In contrast, spending on restaurants, beauty shops, and airlines all plummeted sharply. Consistent with these substitution patterns, online spending increased sharply: online purchases increased by 37% from the first to the second quarter of 2020 (U.S. Department of Commerce 2020). A conventional reduction in income or wealth would typically reduce spending on all goods as predicted by their Engel curves (income elasticities); the fact that the spending reductions vary so sharply across goods in line with their health risks lends further support to the hypothesis that health concerns (either one’s own health or altruistic concerns about others’ health) rather than a lack of purchasing power drove spending reductions. These patterns of spending reductions differ sharply from those observed in prior recessions. Figure 2d compares the change in spending across categories in national accounts data in the COVID recession and the Great Recession in 2009-10. In the Great Recession, nearly all of the reduction in consumer spending came from a reduction in spending on goods; spending on services was almost unchanged. In the COVID recession, 67% of the reduction in total spending came from a reduction in spending on services, as anticipated by Mathy (2020). ",

Income losses were relatively modest because few high-income individuals lost their jobs – as we show in Section III.C below – and lower-income households who experienced job loss had their incomes more than replaced by supplemental unemployment benefits (Ganong, Noel, and Vavra 2020), which led unemployed households to increase their spending relative to pre-COVID levels (Farrell et al., 2020a).18 Indeed, national accounts data actually show an increase in total income of 13% from March to April 2020. This finding implies that the central channel emphasized in Keynesian models that have guided policy responses to prior recessions – a fall in aggregate demand due to a lack of purchasing power – was less important in the early stages of the pandemic, partly thanks to government policies such as increases in unemployment benefits and easing of monetary policy. Rather, the key driver of residual changes in aggregate spending was a contraction in firms’ ability to supply certain goods, namely services that carry no health risks – consistent with the mechanisms emphasized by Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020).19 We now show that this source of spending reductions leads to a novel set of downstream impacts on businesses and the labor market, potentially calling for different policy responses than in prior recessions.

One explanation for this lack of re-equilibration even within labor markets is that, unlike in prior recoveries, many workers may have simply returned to their previous jobs as the economy recovered rather than shifting to new jobs. Given the high levels of churn typically observed in low-wage labor markets, one would expect greater convergence in employment rates across workers with different initial conditions over time.

In most states, reopening was a gradual process in which certain industries and types of businesses opened before others, but there was a lot of heterogeneity across states in the precise form that the reopening took.

Figure 12e then plots 1 minus the ratio of the counterfactual variance to the actual variance, which is a measure of the importance of early reopenings in explaining the variation in economic activity observed on May 18. These ratios are very low, showing that early reopenings did not play an important role in explaining why some states had stronger employment trajectories than others.36 These results are consistent with the findings of other contemporaneous studies showing that little of the state-level variation in employment, job vacancies, or time spent outside home is related to state-level stay-at-home orders or business closures (Bartik et al. 2020, Forsythe et al. 2020, Goolsbee and Syverson 2020, Lin and Meissner 2020, Villas-Boas et al. 2020). Why did these reopenings have so little immediate impact on economic activity? The evidence in Section III suggests that health concerns among consumers were the primary driver of the sharp decline in economic activity in March and April. Consistent with that evidence, spending fell sharply in most states before formal state closures (Appendix Figure 12). If individuals’ own health concerns are the core driver of reductions in spending during pandemics, governments may have limited capacity to mechanically restore economic activity through reopenings if those reopenings are not interpreted by consumers as a signal of reduced health risks.37 ",

In a frictionless model where businesses and workers could costlessly reallocate their capital and labor to other sectors, the reallocation of spending across sectors and areas might have no consequence for employment levels. But if workers’ ability to switch jobs is constrained – e.g., because of jobspecific skills that limit switching across industries or costs that limit moving across geographic areas, as suggested by Yagan (2019) – the ability of the stimulus to foster a uniform recovery in employment to pre-COVID levels is likely to be hampered, perhaps explaining why employment levels remained well below baseline even as total spending recovered after April 15.

We estimate this regression on the sample of firms with 100-800 employees using data from March 11 to August 15. We focus on employment impacts up to August 15 because Figure 15a suggests that employment rates in the two groups converged after early August (extending the estimation window would only further reduce the estimated impacts of the PPP). We reweight by two-digit NAICS code so that the distributions of industries in the below-500 and above-500 employee groups both match the overall distribution of industries in January 2020. We cluster standard errors at the county-by-industry-by-firm-size level to permit correlation in errors across firms and over time within counties and estimate the regression using OLS, weighting by the total number of employees in the cell from January 4-31, 2020.

In the presence of such substitution, our DD estimate would overstate the causal effect of the PPP on employment at small businesses, providing an upper bound for its partial equilibrium impact (ignoring general equilibrium effects that may have influenced consumer demand and employment at all firms).

Our measures of firm size – which are based on employment levels in 2018 from the ReferenceUSA database for the Earnin sample and employment levels in 2019 from Dun & Bradstreet data for the Paychex sample – do not correspond perfectly to the measures used by the Small Business Administration to determine PPP eligibility. Such measurement error in firm size attenuates the estimates of $\\beta_{D D}$ obtained from (1) relative to the true causal effect of PPP eligibility because some of the firms classified as having more than 500 employees may have actually received PPP (and vice versa). We estimate the degree of this attenuation bias by matching our data on firm sizes to data publicly released by the Small Business Administration (SBA) on a selected set of PPP recipients and assessing the extent to which firms are misclassified around the threshold. We estimate that our reduced-form estimates are attenuated by $35\\%$ based on this matched data (see Appendix D for details). Under standard assumptions required to obtain a local average treatment effect in the presence of non-compliance – no direct effect of being classified as having more than 500 workers independent of the PPP and a monotonic treatment effect – we can estimate the LATE of the PPP on employment rates by multiplying the raw estimates reported in Table 1 by 1.35 (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996). This gives us a final preferred point estimate for the effect of PPP eligibility on employment of 2.41 percentage points. ",

One potential explanation is that the loans were taken by firms that did not intend to layoff many employees to begin with, i.e. firms that were inframarginal recipients of loans. Consistent with this hypothesis, Granja et al. (2020) show that states and congressional districts that experienced more job losses prior to April 3 actually received fewer PPP loans. Moreover, PPP loans also were not distributed to the industries most likely to experience job losses from the COVID crisis. For example, firms in the professional, scientific, and technical services industry received a greater share of the PPP loans than accommodation and food services (SBA 2020). Yet accommodation and food services accounted for half of the total decline in employment between February and March (prior to PPP enactment) in BLS statistics, while employment in professional, scientific and technical services accounted for less than 5% of the decline.

We find that COVID19 induced high-income households to self-isolate and sharply reduce spending in sectors that require physical interaction. This spending shock in turn led to losses in business revenue and layoffs of low-income workers at firms that cater to high-income consumers. Because the root cause of the shock was self-isolation driven by health concerns, there was limited capacity to restore economic activity without addressing the virus itself, at least in the initial months after the pandemic began in mid-March. In particular, state-ordered reopenings of economies had only modest impacts on economic activity; stimulus checks increased spending particularly among low-income households, but very little of the additional spending flows to the businesses most affected by COVID; and loans to small businesses had little impact on employment rates. Our analysis therefore suggests that the most effective approach to mitigating economic hardship in the midst of a pandemic may be to provide benefits to those who have lost their incomes to mitigate consumption losses, while investing in public health measures to restore consumer confidence and ultimately increase spending.

To illustrate, Figure 16 plots weekly student progress (lessons completed) on Zearn, an online math platform used by nearly one million elementary school students as part of their regular school curriculum. Children in high-income areas temporarily learned less on this platform when the COVID crisis hit and schools shifted to remote instruction, but soon recovered to baseline levels. By contrast, children in lower-income areas remained 50% below baseline levels through the end of the school year. Although this platform captures only one aspect of education, these findings raise the concern that pandemics may amplify inequality in the long-run by hindering human capital development especially for lower-income children.

By automating the data processing to the extent possible, we aim to post data as close to real-time as possible, while maintaining the quality of the data and minimizing the manual upkeep required. The primary source of lags in the posted data is therefore driven by lags in the underlying data generating processes: for example, card transactions can take up to a week to settle and employment income is typically paid in bi-weekly or monthly payrolls.

Many companies have unique policies and requirements for securing data transfers, so we write scripts to intake this data using a variety of secure file transfer services (e.g. Amazon S3 buckets and SFTP servers).

We version control each snapshot of the data we download within the same Git repository that stores our code using a tool called DVC (“Data Version Control”). DVC creates a pointer to a hash of the raw data for each data file or folder (in other words, a shortcut to the files in the data lake), which we version control in Git and update every time new data is downloaded. This associates each snapshot of data with the code that existed at the time it was processed, and allows us to easily roll back our code and data simultaneously to any prior state.

For counties with only one break below this threshold, we correct our estimates as follows. We first compute the state-level week-to-week percent change in spending excluding all counties with a structural break (using the national series for DC and states for which all counties have a structural break). If we identify a structural break in week $t$ , we impute spending levels in weeks $t-1$ , $t$ , and $t+1$ , as we cannot ascertain the precise date when the structural break occurred (e.g., it may have occurred on the 2nd day of week $t-1$ or the 6th day of week $t$ ). When there is a change in coverage we adjust the series to be in line with the lower level of coverage. For example, suppose a county has $n$ active cards up until week $t$ , when the number of cards in the county increases to $3n$ . In week $t-2$ , the county would have a level of $n$ cards, its reported value. In week $t-1$ , if counties in the rest of the state had a $5\\%$ increase in the number of cards, we would impute the county with a break to have a level of $1.05n$ cards. In week $t$ , if counties in the rest of the state had a $10\\%$ increase in the number of cards, we would impute $t$ to have a level of $(1.10)\\times(1.05n)=1.155n$ . Likewise, if counties in the rest of the state had an 8% decrease in the number of cards in week $t+1$ , we would impute $t+1$ to have a level of $(0.92)\\times(1.155n)=1.0626n$ . At this point, state-level fluctuations no longer impact the series, and we use the reported percent change each week to adjust this number for card coverage. We omit 98 counties with multiple structural breaks from our series. We do not remove any counties where the structural break occurred between March 10th and March 31st of 2020 because the consumer spending response to the COVID-19 was so strong that in many places it could be classified as a structural break. For the week around Christmas, we impute the number of cards by averaging the preceding and succeeding week, since holiday spending spikes are also sometimes classified as a structural break. ",

We first match Earnin employers to ReferenceUSA firms if the firms are within one mile of one another, and share the same firm name. Second, where no such match is available, we choose the geographically closest firm (up to a distance of one mile) among all firms with string similarities of over 0.6. Third, where no such match is available, we match an Earnin employer to the ReferenceUSA employer within twenty-five miles with the highest trigram string similarity, provided that the match has a trigram string similarity of 0.9. We then compute the modal parent-firm match in the ReferenceUSA data for each parent-firm grouping in Earnin. Where at least 80% of locations within a parent-firm grouping in Earnin are matched to a single parent-firm grouping in the ReferenceUSA data, we impute that parent-firm to every Earnin location. In total, we match around 70% of Earnin employers to ReferenceUSA firms. ",

Instead, we make the conceptually similar assumption that workers are employed throughout the full duration of their paycycle, such that we can infer the full set of dates on which an individual worked by observing the last date of each of their pay periods and their pay frequency. Under the assumptions that all workers within a given firm are paid according to the same paycycle, our approach of inferring employment based on last date of pay period matches the approach in Cajner et al.

We reweight the Paychex data to match the national Intuit industry distribution and compute the percentage difference between the employment decline in the reweighted Paychex data and the Intuit data in each geography-month cell. We then apply this correction factor to each wage-industry cell in the Paychex data to obtain imputed values by wage and industry for the relevant industries covered by Intuit. For instance, if Intuit exhibits a 5% larger employment decline than the reweighted Paychex series in Manhattan in April, we would impute a value for each wage-by-industry cell covered in the Intuit data that is 1.05 times the decline observed in Paychex for that cell.

To compute these changes, we begin by calculating total daily spending in the Affinity Solutions data for each day in 2019 and 2020. We then inflate these numbers to estimate total card spending for the full U.S. population by multiplying by the ratio of January 2020 (or 2019) total spending for components of PCE that are likely captured in credit/debit card spending (shown in the last bar of Figure 1a) to the January 2020 (or 2019) total spending in the Affinity data. In Column (1), we calculate the change in card spending as ((Spending for April 8 through April 14 2020) - (Spending for April 8 through April 14 2019)) - ((Spending for January 4 through January 31 2020) - (Spending for January 4 - January 31 2019)). Columns (2) and (3) replicate Column (1) for the June 8-14 and July 8-14 periods respectively, instead of April 8-14. Column (4) shows mean daily national spending over the period of January 4-31 2020. Panel A shows changes in total spending for the full sample and separately by income quartile, imputed using median household income within the cardholder's residential ZIP code in the 2014-2018 ACS. The share of the national decline accounted for by each quartile is shown in parentheses in each row. The declines in card spending among bottom-quartile and top-quartile ZIP codes in Panel A Columns (1) and (2) appear in the annotations on Figure 2a. Panel B replicates Panel A, disaggregating by categories of goods instead of income quartiles. For definitions of these categories, see Appendix B. The shares of the total change in consumer spending summed across these four categories in Panel B do not necessarily add up to $100\\%$ because of spending on uncategorized goods or services. Panel C disaggregates the change in consumer spending within in-person services across five sub-categories, which add up to $100\\%$ of in-person services. Data source: Affinity Solutions. ",

Each state that reopens is matched to multiple control states (listed in Appendix Table 6) that did not reopen within the subsequent 3 weeks but had similar trends of the outcome variable during the weeks preceding the reopening. We construct the control group separately for each re-opening day and then stack the resulting event studies to align the events. All estimates are from OLS regressions at the State $\\mathrm{x}$ Week level of the change in the outcome variable relative to January on an indicator variable for the state being a state that reopened, an indicator variable for the date being after the reopening date, and the interaction between these two variables. We report the coefficient and standard error on the interaction term, which we refer to as the difference-in-difference (DD) estimate of the effect of reopening. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in parentheses. The dependent variable is rescaled to be in percentage terms such that, for example, the first row of Column (1) indicates that the difference-in-difference estimate for the effect of reopening on consumer spending over a two-week horizon is a 1.45 percentage point increase in consumer spending. The third row indicates the \"Analysis Window\" used in the regression: for example, the sample in column (1) is restricted to the two weeks before and after the date of reopening, whereas the sample in column (2) is restricted to the three weeks before and after the date of reopening. The last row shows the mean decline in the outcome variable across states from the period January 4-31 to the period March 25-April 14 — except in columns (7) and (8) which use January 4-31 instead of January 4-31 as the January reference period, and columns (9) and (10) which use January 3-February 6 as the January reference period.

Panel A shows estimated effects of stimulus payments on consumer spending. To construct the estimates, we first express consumer spending on each day as a percentage change relative to mean daily consumer spending over the period January 4-31 in the corresponding calendar year. We then residualize these daily percentage changes with respect to day of week and first day of the month fixed effects, which we estimate using data from January 1, 2019, to May 10, 2019. We then compute OLS regressions of the residualized outcome variable on an indicator variable for the date being on or after April 15 2020, using a linear control function before and after April 15, and excluding the partially treated date of April 14. The first row shows the coefficient on the indicator variable for the date being on or after April 15, which we refer to as the RD effect of stimulus; standard errors are reported in parentheses. The dependent variable is scaled as a percentage change from January so that, for example, the first row of Column (1) indicates that stimulus payments increased consumer spending by 25.15 percentage points in bottom income quartile ZIP codes relative to the January 2020 level of spending. In columns (1) and (2), we compute daily changes in spending restricted to cardholders in ZIP codes in the bottom quartile of the distribution of ZIP code median household income (based on data from the 2014-2018 ACS).

Columns (1) and (2) present regressions in combined Paychex-Earnin data. In the baseline estimate in column (1), which corresponds to the difference-in-difference estimate in Figure 15a, we begin by restricting to firms with between 100 and 800 employees. We then reweight firms on 2-digit NAICS codes such that the (worker-weighted) distribution of 2-digit NAICS codes within Paychex firms in each size bin matches the national distribution of 2-digit NAICS codes among Paychex firms in the period January 4-31 2020. We do the same for Earnin firms. Next, to combine the datasets, we reweight such that the (workerweighted) share of each dataset is constant in each firm size bin. We then sum employment across datasets at the county $\\mathbf{\\deltaX}$ 2-digit NAICS $\\mathrm{x}$ income quartile x eligibility x week level. Finally, we report estimates from regression equation (1): an OLS regression of changes in employment on county x worker income quartile $\\mathbf{X}$ week fixed effects, an indicator for PPP eligibility (firm size <500 employees), an indicator for dates after April 3, and an interaction term between PPP eligibility and the date being after April 3 (the DD estimate). The sample for this regression is limited to weeks ending between March 11 and August 15; we restrict the sample to these weeks because Figure 15a indicates that there is little evidence of a persistent effect on employment for businesses that were eligible for PPP assistance after mid-August. The DD estimate is the coefficient on the interaction term for PPP eligibility and the date being after April 3. We cluster standard errors (reported in parentheses) at the county x industry level, and winsorize the dependent variable at the 99th percentile (weighted by reweighted employment over the period January 4-31).

We compute ZIP-level changes in consumer spending in the Affinity data as the percentage change in seasonally-adjusted spending from the period January 4-31 to the period March 25-April 14, winsorizing at the 99th percentile of (population-weighted) ZIP-level changes in employment. We construct the average workplace rent variable by combining data on the matrix of home residence by workplace ZIP codes taken from Census’ LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) for low-income workers (workers earning below $\\S$ 1,250 per month) with data on median two bedroom monthly rents from the 2014-2018 ACS. In particular, we assign median rents from the ACS to each ZIP code of workplace in the LODES data and then compute mean workplace rent in each home ZIP code, weighting by the number of low-wage jobs in each workplace ZIP code. The dependent variable is scaled from 0 to 100 and the independent variable is expressed in thousands such that, for example, the coefficient of -12.61 in Column (1) implies that a $\\$1000$ increase in monthly workplace rent is associated with a 12.61% larger drop in total spending.

Panel A examines the change in GDP from Q1-2020 to Q2-2020 using NIPA data (Tables 1.1.2, 1.1.6 and 2.3.2 from the Second Estimate of 2nd Quarter 2020 Gross Domestic Product, released on August 27 2020). The first bar shows the seasonally-adjusted change in real GDP $(-\\$1.73\\mathrm{T})$ . In parentheses under the first bar we report the compound annual growth rate corresponding to this one-quarter change in real GDP $\\left(-31.7\\%\\right)$ . Bars two through five show the contribution to the change in real GDP of its components, estimated using NIPA Table 1.1.2. The final bar shows the contribution of components of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) that are likely to be captured in credit card spending (-\\$1.03T), estimated using NIPA Table 2.3.2. This includes all components of PCE except for motor vehicles and parts, housing and utilities, health care, and the final consumption expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households. This bar indicates total spending (including spending in other modes of payment, e.g. cash) in categories of goods and services which are likely to be well-represented in card spending data, rather than total card spending itself. Panel B reports changes in average daily spending for each month in the Affinity Solutions credit and debit card data and the Advance Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MARTS). The retail series in Panel B restricts to retail trade sectors (NAICS 44-45) excluding motor vehicles (NAICS 441) and gas (NAICS 447). The MARTS series is constructed by dividing the total spending in each category by the number of days in that month, and then indexing the average daily spending to January of the corresponding year. The Affinity series is constructed by taking the monthly average of the seven-day moving average series indexed to January of the respective year. We also report the root mean squared error (RMSE) corresponding to the difference between indexed MARTS monthly spending and indexed Affinity monthly spending. Panel C displays a scatter plot of changes in spending at the three-digit NAICS code level between January and April 2020 in the Affinity data vs. the MARTS data, restricting to industries where the industry definitions in the Affinity Solutions data align closely with a three-digit NAICS code surveyed in the MARTS. We report the correlation between changes in the Affinity and MARTS data, weighted by total MARTS spending in January 2020. Data source: Affinity Solutions. ",

Panel A plots a weekly series of average daily consumer spending, separately for cardholders residing in ZIP codes in the top and bottom (population-weighted) quartiles of median household income (measured using the 2014-2018 ACS). We inflate the spending observed in Affinity data to estimate total spending for the full U.S. population by multiplying by the ratio of January 2020 (or 2019) total spending for components of PCE that are likely captured in credit/debit card spending (described in the notes to Figure 1) to the January 2020 (or 2019) total spending in the Affinity data. The annotations in Panel A display the change in spending during the periods of April 8-14, July 8-14 and Sept 28-Oct 4 respectively (calculated as described in Table 1). Panel B disaggregates seasonally-adjusted spending changes (left bar) and pre-COVID levels (right bar) by sector. In the left bar of Panel B, the total decline being decomposed is defined as ((Spending in March 25 through April 14 2020) - (Spending in March 25 through April 14 2019)) - ((Spending in January 4 through January 31 2020) - (Spending in January 4 through January 31 2019)). The right bar of Panel B shows the sectoral shares of spending during January 4-31 2020. See Appendix B for the definitions of these sectors. Panel C compares seasonally-adjusted trends in weekly consumer spending for five specific categories of goods and pooled consumer spending. Panel D decomposes the change in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in the Great Recession and the COVID-19 Recession using NIPA Table 2.3.6U. PCE is defined here as the sum of services, durables and non-durables in seasonally adjusted, chained (2012) dollars.

In each panel, we show a daily series of private non-farm employment constructed by combining Paychex, Intuit and Earnin data, as described in Section II.C. We separate the sample into wage quartiles based on fixed thresholds of the 2019 hourly wage distribution. In Panel A, the solid portion of each line represents the combined Paychex-Intuit-Earnin data, while the dashed portion of the line is forecasted using Kronos data and Paychex data from firms with weekly paycycles. To construct this forecast, we regress the combined Paychex-Intuit-Earnin series on the de-seasonalized Kronos series for the same date $\\mathbf{\\rho}(t)$ , the Paychex weekly series for the same date $\\mathbf{\\rho}(t)$ , and the Paychex weekly series for three prior weeks $(t-7),(t-14),(t-21)$ . We then use the resulting coefficients to predict the value of combined Paychex-Intuit-Earnin employment before the combined data is available. In Panel B, we reweight Paychex-Intuit-Earnin data to examine whether differences in employment trends between the top and bottom wage quartile are explained by differences in industry and geographic composition. We restrict the sample in Panel B to county x industry (2-digit NAICS) cells which have nonzero first-quartile and fourth-quartile employment in the period January 4-31 2020; this sample restriction excludes $0.9\\%$ of worker-days from the sample. We then calculate the daily change in employment since January 4-31 2020 in each county x industry $\\mathbf{X}$ income quartile cell, winsorizing at the 99th percentile (weighted by total employment in the period January 4-31 2020). For the top and bottom wage quartiles, we estimate overall daily employment by taking the weighted mean of employment changes in every county $\\mathbf{X}$ industry cell, weighting by the level of employment in January 4-31. These series are similar but not identical to Panel A because of the sample restriction and winsorization. Finally, we estimate bottom quartile employment reweighted to match the industry and geographic composition of top quartile employment by performing the same procedure, but weighting bottom quartile employment changes by top quartile employment levels in January 4-31 in each cell. In Panel C, we restrict to the retail trade sector (NAICS 44-45) and present the change relative to January 4-31 in the Paychex-Intuit-Earnin employment series and the Affinity consumer card spending series.

First we measure the distribution of workplace ZIP codes for low-income workers (earning below \\$1,250 per month) using the matrix of home ZIP codes by workplace ZIP codes in the Census LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES). Then, for each home ZIP code, we use these distributions to construct a weighted mean over the median rent of a two-bedroom apartment in workplace ZIP codes (measured in the 2014-2018 ACS), weighting by the share of low-income workers in each workplace ZIP code. Panel A presents the change in employment rates among low-income workers from January 4-31 to April 8-28 2020, measured by home ZIP code in Earnin data, winsorizing at the 99th percentile of (population-weighted) ZIP-level changes in employment.

Panel A presents a time series plot of the change in seasonally-adjusted consumer spending relative to the base period of January 4-31 for New Mexico and Colorado. Colorado partially reopened non-essential businesses on May 1, while New Mexico did not do so until May 16. Panel B presents an event study plot of the same outcome variable, showing average spending changes in five states (SC, AK, GA, MN and MS) that partially reopened non-essential businesses between April 20 and April 27. Each reopening state is matched to multiple control states (listed in Appendix Table 6) that did not reopen within the subsequent 3 weeks but had similar trends of the outcome variable during the weeks preceding the reopening. We construct the control group separately for each reopening day and then stack the resulting event studies to align the events. Panel C replicates Panel B with the change in employment relative to January 4-31 measured using combined Paychex-Intuit-Earnin data (as described in Section II.C). Panel D replicates Panel B with the seasonally-adjusted change in small businesses open measured using Womply data. In Panels B to D, we report the coefficient from a difference-in-differences regression comparing treated vs. untreated states in the two weeks following vs. the two weeks prior to the partial reopening (also reported in Table 3). Panel $\\mathrm{E}$ reports the share of variance in outcomes explained by reopenings as of May 18. To estimate these variance shares, we first calculate the variance of each outcome across states on May 18, 2020. Then, we add the difference-in-difference estimate for the effect of reopening on a given outcome to all states not open on May 18 (adding only half of the effect if the state opened between May 11 and May 18). We then recalculate the variance in this counterfactual in which all states had reopened. The share of variance explained by reopenings for each outcome is defined as 1-(counterfactual variance/actual variance). Data sources: Affinity Solutions, Paychex, Intuit, Earnin, Womply. ",

Panel A compares employment trends measured in Paychex and Earnin data among firms with 100-500 employees (generally eligible for PPP loans) to firms with 501-800 employees (generally ineligible for PPP loans). To construct these employment trends, we begin by calculating weekly employment changes relative to January 4-31 2020 disaggregated by data source, county, industry (2-digit NAICS), wage quartile and firm size bin. We reweight these cells so that the composition in each firm size bin matches the pooled distribution of industry and data source over the period January 4-31 2020. We plot the “control” series (firms with 501-800 employees) directly as the mean weekly value of the reweighted employment series. We plot the “treated” series (firms with 100-500 employees) as the sum of the control series and the weekly difference between control and treated firms after residualizing on interacted county and wage quartile fixed effects. For visual clarity, we recenter each series so the mean change in employment is $0\\%$ over the pre-period (February 12 to March 18). The difference between these two series corresponds to the regression estimate in Column 1 of Table 5, which is also reported in the figure. Panel B presents a binned scatter plot of changes in reweighted employment (defined as in Panel A) from January 4-31 to June 1-23 vs. firm size. To construct changes in employment by firm size, we first classify firms in bins of size 50 according to their parent employer size.

We compute this correlation by collapsing both datasets to the national weekly level, where values in each week are expressed as the percentage change from the January average. To adjust for measurement error at the weekly level, we calculate the series-specific reliability as the week-on-week correlation within each dataset. We then divide the raw weekly correlation between datasets by the square root of the product of the reliabilities to get the signal correlation. Data sources: CoinOut, Affinity Solutions. ",
