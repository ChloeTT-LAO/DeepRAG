The segment controllers manage lights and act as an interface to the ctiy’s wide-area network; however, they are also general purpose connectivity products.  Any networked product or sensor sharing the common technology of the streetlighting system can be added to the segment controller.  This means that the streetlight is only the first end-point on the network, others can be added later— preserving a city’s investment in the streetlighting system.  For example, after the system is installed, pedestrian sensors could be added to extend the functionality of the system and provide actionable data to the system—lights could brighten when a pedestrian is detected at a crosswalk.  Finally, within the lights themselves, embedded communications distributes the intelligence to the end-point.  Doing so allows the lights to act independently of, or in cooperation with external information and events.  In the case of our lighting system, were the city’s WAN to fail, there would be no impact on the streetlighting.  Individual lights would still respond to lighting, time, or environmental conditions at the local level.  Were pedestrian sensors in place, lights would still balance their output.  Also, if the city enabled their parks and recreation reservation software to send time and location data to the streetlighting system, lights could brighten at the beginning and end of night games—providing additional safety and security.

A CNP device can transmit a message with as few as 9 bytes of protocol overhead. Messages may be delivered to a single device or to any group of devices.   \nReliabledeliveryofmesages.  Even though an individual message may consist of a few bytes, the reliable delivery of every message may be critical to the   \napplication.  CNP includes reliable message delivery services that retry a   \nmessage transmission when a communication failure occurs and informs the sending application if an unrecoverable failure occurs.  Resynchronization is immediate if a previously unreachable destination becomes reachable within the retry interval.   \nDuplicatemesagedetection.  Some types of control messages must not be delivered multiple times.  For example, if a monitoring application that is counting events were to receive duplicate messages, the event count would become incorrect.  CNP prevents duplicate messages from being passed to the receiving application.   \nMultiplecom unicationsmedia.  Many control systems require multiple   \ncommunications media for lowest total system cost.  Twisted-pair cable provides the best performance and is a good solution where it is practical to install the cable.  Link power communications lowers device costs by providing power over the same media as communications.  Communications over existing power lines provides the lowest installation cost.  CNP is media independent so that all these media, and more, are supported.  In addition, CNP also supports routers so that devices on different channels can interoperate.  A hierarchical addressing scheme is used to support low-cost and easily maintained routers.   \nLowdevicecost.  A control device may be as simple as a sensor for a single point such as a limit switch or a temperature sensor.  With the capability to put control in every point, it is important that the protocol not be too demanding in terms of memory and computing resources at each device.  CNP is optimized to minimize the code size of protocol firmware and to minimize RAM requirements for buffer storage.  For example, the complete implementation of CNP running on a Neuron core requires less than 10 Kbytes of code and less than 1 Kbyte of RAM.   \nLowinstalationandmaintenancecost.  Low device cost does not lead to low system cost unless devices are easily installed in networks, networks are easily modified, and repairing networks after a failure is simple.  CNP includes   \ncomplete support for installation and maintenance so that simple devices in simple networks can manage their own network installation, low-cost installation tools can be used to install and maintain more complex networks, and low-cost diagnostic tools can be used to diagnose failures in any type of network.   \nEficientuseofchan elbandwidth.  To keep system costs down, many devices must be able to efficiently share a single communications channel.  CNP uses innovative media access technologies to provide the most efficient use of the communications channels, even under conditions of high loading.   \nInteroperablesystems.  Multiple systems may need to interoperate to provide additional benefits to the end users.  For example, a fire alarm system may interoperate with an elevator control system to keep elevators away from burning floors and may interoperate with an emergency exit lighting system to illuminate exit signs.  In addition to supporting interoperability between devices, CNP also allows devices from different vendors to be installed using a common set of installation strategies and tools.   \nSeparationofsystems.  Multiple systems that should not interoperate may share a common communication medium, especially in the case of open media such as power line.  CNP allows these systems to operate independently without mutual interference by isolating devices that communicate with each other into domains. A domainis a logical collection of devices that communicate with each other. Devices in different domains cannot communicate directly with each other—they must communicate through a common gateway.   \nPreventtampering.  Because control systems do more than just move data, it should not be possible for an unauthorized user to inject commands into the network.  CNP includes an authentication protocol that prevents tampering by unauthorized users. ",

The protocol permits the network management tool to allocate a fixed number of beta 2 slots per channel as priority time slots dedicated to priority devices.  The number of priority slots can be from 0 to 127.  The network management tool that assigns priority slots to individual devices can ensure that one and only one device is assigned to a particular priority slot on the channel.  Each priority time slot on a channel adds a minimum of two bit times to the transmission of every message.  The amount of overhead will vary based upon the bit rate, oscillator accuracy, and transceiver requirements.  For example, using a TP/XF-1250 1.25Mbps twisted pair transceiver with all devices on the channel having an oscillator accuracy of $0.02\\%$ $(200\\mathrm{ppm})$ or better, each priority slot is 30 bit-times wide.  Because there is no contention for the media during the priority portion of a packet cycle, devices configured with priority have better response time than non-priority devices. ",

For example, if a device sends an acknowledged message with four retries to five devices, there will be a minimum of six packets—the original message plus five acknowledgements.  If the same message was sent with the repeated service with a repeat count of four, only four packets would be generated, yet the probability of delivery would be identical.  A good rule-of-thumb is to use repeated service instead of acknowledged service whenever the size of the group is larger than the retry count.  The exception to this rule is if the sending application needs notification of delivery failure, in which case acknowledged service should be used.  This is typically only required if the sending application can take alternative action in case of delivery failure. The least reliable is unacknowledged, where a message is sent once to a device or group of devices and no response is expected.  This is typically used when the receiving application is not sensitive to the loss of a message.  This is typically the case with data that is sent using a periodic heartbeat.

By doing this, the polling application can bypass the network variable configuration and address tables and explicitly control the destination address of the network variable request. For example, a device application can poll network variables on more than 15 different destination devices (single device or groups) by using explicit addressing to overcome the limit of 15 address table entries on a Neuron hosted device.  It can use a single input network variable to receive an unlimited number of responses to polls of any given data type. ",

Timing instability of the transitions, known as jiter, may be caused by changes in the communications medium, or instability in the transmitting or receiving devices’ input clocks.  The jitter tolerance windows are expressed as fractions of the bit period, T, in Table 17.  The MAC clock is 10MHz for a 5000 Series chip running at a 10MHz or greater system clock, is 5Mhz for a 5000 Series chip running at a 5MHz system clock, and is one half the input clock for a 3100 Series chip.
