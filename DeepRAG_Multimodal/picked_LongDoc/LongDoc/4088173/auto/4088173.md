# Your Companion  

ome July 18, 2013. We shall be celebrating the 4th edition of the mBillionth Award South Asia recognizing the best mobile innovations and practitioners for the year 2013. once again, the mobile for development fraternity will converge to celebrate the bright ideas, innovations, and practices. the channel for robust partnerships and collaborations will be strengthened and renewed.  

it gives immense satisfaction to see how the mBillionth has emerged in the past four years in South Asia. the reason, the mBillionth being the only such forum to experience, share and exchange ideas, innovations and partnerships in the region with more than 1.5 billion population.  

my warmest acknowledgement goes to the mBillionth nominees who have made the 4th edition more vibrant and contemporary. A total of 291 nominees for 2013 reflect the immense faith of the mobile innovators and practitioners on the forum, their own forum. the support of all stakeholders, the wider mobile community has gone into this: creating a regional platform to sit, talk, share, exchange  

The support of all stakeholders, the wider mobile community has gone into this: creating a regional platform to sit, talk, share, exchange and learn from each other. Irrespective of winning or not winning the mBillionth recognitions, it the effort behind each nominee innovations that the mBillionth celebrates.  And the good work must go on.  

and learn from each other. irrespective of winning or not winning the mBillionth recognitions, it the effort behind each nominee innovations that the mBillionth celebrates. And the good work must go on.  

the partnership and association of stakeholder have strengthened the platform each year towards improvisation and scalability. the support of industry partners in Vodafone and Nokia has been splendid and overwhelming in the pursuit of mobile for development objectives. the association from internet & mobile Association of india (iAmAi) has been timely and immensely contributory over the years. the mBillionth wouldn’t have scaled new heights but for strategic partnership that mint has provided for years.  the support of PwC has provided a wider strategic dimension.  

if one would ask how mBillionth has successfully outreached to destinations and territories unthinkable, my answer would be the role of our outreach partners who has brought in new thoughts, approach and opportunities for mBillionth. this timely support of the invaluable partners – iCtA, Dnet, CAN, NiCtAA, Bytes for All, Glocal University, mP Post, medianama, mobile Social Networking, telecom Watch, mydala, innoz, Dreamcast, and telecom Uncovered – has gone and will go a long way in building an enabling mobile environment in the region.  

A special acknowledgement and gratitude goes to our valuable exhibitors and partners coming together to share innovations, applications and practices during mBillionth 2013. the mobile innovation Haat shall showcase more than 60 best practices and projects from india and South Asia including NGo good practices in the ‘Vodafone mobiles for Good’ Pavilion.  

my acknowledgement to the advisory board members of Digital Empowerment Foundation, whose continuous guidance, inputs have made things really different. Also my sincere regards and acknowledgement for the brilliant support of the Jurors of the mBillionth 2013 Jury for their dedication, commitment and contributions in bringing quality, sanity and value to the mBillionth Award.  

if names speak thousand words, let me express my special thanks and gratitude those minds whose association and support has meant a lot - laura turkington, Soumya Sarkar, Amir Ullah Khan, Rajen Varada, madan mohan  

Rao, milind Pathak, Anuraj Gambhir, Arjun Basu, mahesh Uppal, indumini Kodikara, Sushil Raj Pandey, mohammad Chowdhury, Pranshu Singhal, Binay tiwari, Dr. Ananya Raihan, Prof. Debabrata Goswami, mahesh Venkateshwaran, and N. Ramakrishnana.

# Accommodating the Mobile Masses in South Asia  

# Osama Manzar  

nly good governance can provide an answer to the problem of delivery systems. if what is meant for the poor does not reach them in the proportion it is meant to, then corruption and inefficiency are its two main causes. mobile technologies offer momentous opportunities for upholding good governance, effective service delivery, increasing accountability and fighting corruption since they can reach citizens directly through interactive conduits of communication. they allow rapid data collection and access to information and offer innovative paths for social mobilisation and effective community participation.  

these are the learning that we have got at DEF, through mBillionth which has been on the ground for 4 years, identifying the best in mobile and telecom innovations across india and South Asia. And these projects are from across : m-Health, m-travel & tourism, m-infrastructure, m-Governance, m-Entertainment, m-Business & Commerce/Banking, m-inclusion, m-Education & learning, m-Environment, m-Culture & Heritage, m-News & Journalism, mWoman & Children. Here we are presenting  

Believe it or not, today 4 per cent of our GDP comes from the Internet and that number is only set to grow through mobile based internet.  

how the mBillionth 13 has come into shape and what’s the learning that we can show.  

Social entrepreneurship in mobile sector is witnessing a "mainstreaming" of sorts. these ventures no longer need to depend solely on philanthropy or grants to take off. Even "unabashedly commercial investors" are willing to support businesses that promote inclusive economic development and reach out to the underserved markets of india.  

there are many such innovations which we have seen in our mBillionth Award, initiated to honour and recognise mobile practitioners who are working at grassroots level and how mobile is impacting their lives. the repository of mobile innovations across all South Asia nations has been equally exemplary and contemporary in excellence. mBillionth Award 2013 is the fourth edition. one holistic approach in mBillionth is synthesizing this platform with  

![](images/736e95986def49e329c676ad333827df558ee0dfc5ba940ab44b21f013348f5f.jpg)  

Vodafone Foundation. For the past three years this partnership has provided funding windows to nurture and scale up socially relevant mobile applications as deployed and used by NGos we call it “mobile for Good”.  

the journey since inception has been extraordinary, overwhelming. the innovations illustrate the way new discoveries, combinations and solutions in the internet era work together. Where the technological, cultural and technological domains meet at the right time an increased synergy effect can take place due to lucky circumstances and right timing. mBillionth’s recognition and scaling up has reached to more than eight hundred innovators and innovations across South Asia.  

Governments, donors, mobile phone companies and nongovernmental organizations are increasingly aware of the potential of information technology in achieving development goals in a variety of sectors. in response to this, there has been a proliferation of mobile-phone based services and products, as well as mobile phone-based development projects.  

Does information technology promote economic development in South Asian countries? How can it be used to better contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction? Evidence from mBillionth showcase points to the following: Access to information is crucial for ensuring that farmers, traders and consumers can engage in optimal arbitrage – in other words, buying and selling goods when and where it’s needed most. this, in turn, improves market performance, which increases welfare.  

Why this award is called mBillionth? As of literally now, even as you read this, mobile is increasing in numbers each day. it's no secret that mobile is exploding. A report from Ernst & young says that almost $50\%$ of all social media users access social platforms from their mobile devices. this is a portrayal of how many people, how many lives are impacted, with each passing day. this reflects the rate of innovation, applications, content and services serving the needs of millions of people in india and South Asia. the impact is not in millions but in billions.  

We have been doing manthan Award for South Asia for the past 9 years; this is going to be the 10th year. therefore, the reach and network of partnership and coverage is already there. We have a working relationship in these countries, and with partners who are iCt-oriented, digitally inclusive and who have been working in their own countries to make sure the proliferation of iCt and internet happens for the larger good. to mention some: we have iCtA in Sri lanka, CAN in Nepal, Bytes for All in Pakistan, D.Net in Bangladesh and NiCtAA in Afghanistan. the manthan Award helped us to take partnership forward to the mobile domain. the only concern, a challenging one, was how to bring telecom or mobile-based association. And thanks to manthan Award and digital empowerment foundation's extensive work, we have been able to get reliable partners in all these countries of South Asia.  

the success of an innovation can be compared with the coming across the one and only partner of your life. many innovations fail because - and unfortunately you can only see and understand it afterwards - the window of the opportunity was not open wide enough. it's extremely encouraging how individuals, NGos or an organization, or government on its own, have been able to find innovative ways to use the mobile. Because it has reached to the masses, to serve them through health services or several kinds of governance services.  

What is important to consider is the huge indian mass base needs to be served holistically with mobile support services. Private players can play a meaningful role to reach out to the population. many challenges remain. operators need to reinforce customer loyalty and provide more services with high added value. For public authorities and users, population coverage needs to be extended and the cost of access to the service needs to come down. Finally, international donors must play a role in ensuring there is a balance between players, they must help reduce the negative effects of the mobile phone sector and – at the same time – make sure its developmental impacts are maximized. they must also provide their financial support to the expansion of broadband connections in order to give easier access to internet, which would appear to be an even more important factor for economic growth in South Asian countries than the mobile phone itself.  

A 2011 Gallup study of 20 economic entities in Asia showed that india ranked in the bottom quartile on several important indicators of a well-functioning entrepreneurial ecosystem. Although cross-country comparisons might not be ideal because of Asia's diverse economies, governance models and cultures, a bottom quartile ranking across a majority of indicators is alarming.  

![](images/de2e196046fe108910a1d5c3706f0c8ea207262cc964fdef60ff1b1e2d36625d.jpg)  

the mBillionth Award is more than an award. it is an ecosystem. it is a means to scout best practitioners in South Asia region, a subcontinent that shares more commonality of challenges and destiny than anything else. it’s a process to recognize unsung heroes and support their initiatives without any commercial entanglement. it’s an ecosystem of empowerment, identifying best practices, mentoring, funding and cross-exchange of ideas. it has emerged as a wide platform to feed innovative ideas and practices to government stakeholders on ways and means of using mobile applications, solutions of service providers and mobile content creators who are capable enough to serve various national mission mode programmes, if engaged meaningfully. And we feel delighted and encouraged to find this is happening, it is actually happening and that, too, successfully.  

With the rapid development of wireless broadband, mobile communications are evolving from simple voice communication services and text messaging to a more sophisticated offering with a wide range of applications in locations where conventional services are not available. “Smart” wireless phones, for example, now allow users to also browse the internet, download music, and access information services.  

this opportunity is especially promising considering how inadequate infrastructure led the South Asian world to miss out on much of the initial web revolution, and that access to the internet can provide an even bigger boost to economic growth than access to mobile phones. Broadband internet, wireless and fixed, is becoming a service of general economic interest—by enhancing the knowledge, skills, and networks of individuals; raising private sector productivity; and increasing community competitiveness. it also plays an essential role as an enabling technology in increasing investment payoffs in other sectors, transforming research and development, facilitating trade in services and globalization, and improving public services to enhance national business environment and competitiveness  

Given high illiteracy rates in South Asia, a majority of mobile phone users rely on mobile phones primarily for voice calls, rather than data services such as short messaging service (SmS) or internet. mobile phone-based services and products therefore need to be adapted to this reality. Existing economic evidence suggests that mobile phones can, in fact, serve as a powerful tool for economic development in the world’s poorest countries.  But mobile phones are not necessarily a panacea that will lift people out of poverty; rather, they can be used to reduce information costs, improve markets and strengthen development projects in a variety of sectors.  

the long-term focus of mBillionth remains intact. the vision is to consolidate this platform into a strong corpusbased funding and mentoring organization, wherein the focus shall be more towards empowering innovative ideas which can empower the local masses and address local needs of rural markets. the other end of this vision is to create social entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs using mobile as an application to develop, to make a business out of it and reach out to the masses.  

Believe it or not, today 4 per cent of our GDP comes from the internet and that number is only set to grow through mobile based internet. the relevant question today is no longer one about who will win the web. let's instead focus on getting the next million net users to log on. mBillionth 2013 will hit the nail on the head.

# Mobile VAS is dead, Long live Mobile Innovation  

# Mohammad Chowdhury  

have been saying on occasion for the two years i have been living here that india can’t innovate.  my theory that india’s telecom industry can process-replicate but not service-innovate has made me as unpopular as when i’d predicted india would lose 4-0 in the cricket tests in England last summer.  

obsessed by minutes of use, price tinkering, packaging and bundling, indian telecoms have hardly come up with a proper new service innovation for ages.  it isn’t the same at the back-end. Due to network engineering innovation, indian telcos run the city of mumbai on $1/7$ the spectrum of london, and due to innovative customer analytics, they slice and dice the $900\mathrm{m}+$ user base like a master chef chopping onions.  But when it comes to services, the nearest we get to innovation is a handful of agricultural services which enable farmers to gather up-to-date market prices: a once interesting example which has now become a developing country telecom cliché.  

in fact many of the value-added services, or VAS, of yore are now in terminal decline. the days of “ABC services”  

It is difficult to say for all, but certainly some of the mBillionth entries will be successful businesses which scale more and go international.  And there are others which are not out to conquer the world or make their founders rich quick, but rather to make important (even if localised) points.  

are over as more people interested in Astrology, Bollywood and Cricket go and get their information or entertainment directly from the mobile internet, and fewer rely on VAS platforms and mobile operator portals.  So whatever modest service innovation there was in indian telecom is also in decline. Going by the strength of this year’s mBillionth awards entries, i may soon be proved wrong about india not being able to innovate.  locked away for two days in a far-flung stately home in UP (West), i recently scived off work (ssh!) to fulfil my “jury service” commitment for the mBillionth awards (http://mbillionth.in/event-2013). 16 of South Asia’s finest industry thinkers, researchers, journalists, and innovators (plus me), spent days, nights and countless cups of masala tea debating the merits of 155 nominations for the now famous innovation awards.  

![](images/852621cf42a0d7c415dc91e31347683b3c1c490caaa7677c3db9c042f74f9e23.jpg)  

the nominations are spread across $12\cdots$ categories which include mGovernance, mHealth, mEducation and mtravel and tourism.  We argued for hours into the night scoring the entries, sweating it out in the grand but dusty hall of a stout family fort built over a hundred years’ ago, with an $\mathrm{{a/c}}$ which could never cool quickly enough to neutralise the heat from the sultry sunshine streaming in from outside. the maharajah’s living room featured no less than 19 tiger heads, an awful spectacle, given that only some 40 Royal Bengal tigers survive in the Sundarbans today.  i digress.  

# There were many businesses that opened my eyes, including:  

$\bullet$ A mobile-enabled taxi booking service that allows the user to see on a Google map on their handset where the cab is as it approaches;   
$\bullet$ A mobile application that allows property agents to see an aggregated view of bottom-of-pyramid housing stock availability in city slums;   
$\bullet$ A mobile news portal that aggregates the best of Bengali daily content across West Bengal and Bangladesh; $\bullet$ A personal financial planner enabled on your mobile available in telugu;   
$\bullet$ A mobile-enabled supply chain integration package for tea growers in South india   
$\bullet$ A simple app which enables parents to monitor whether their child reached school safely on the school bus.  

many nominations addressed hyper-localised user needs in state languages, illustrating the growing maturity of mobile data services in india, and suggesting that the advent of localised mobile data services may finally be on its way. But how many of the winners of the mBillionth awards are going to survive?  Will mobile internet innovation really take off in india?  Some say that mobile startups are becoming “atomic” to the point of ridiculousness. For instance, an app that tells you that you are five minutes late for a meeting recently picked up $\$6$ million in venture funding –  

http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/disruptions-theecho-chamber-of-silicon-valley/.  

it is difficult to say for all, but certainly some of the mBillionth entries will be successful businesses which scale more and go international.  And there are others which are not out to conquer the world or make their founders rich quick, but rather to make important (even if localised) points, such as the mGovernance entries which provide voice platforms for people to complain to politicians for lack of water or corruption in the transport department. the jury had a lot of time for these entries, the ones that are using mobile to bind communities together and make our society stronger.

# Mobile Startups: At the cutting edge of digital innovation  

# Madanmohan Rao  

Local languages are being increasingly supported at the information and device level. Having more tools, content and services in the local language can drive local innovation in South Asia.  

tsatdaortp-tiuopns oifniCatcscefloerraltlinsegcttohres edged in forums around the world, ranging from the mBillionth and mobiSparks conferences to the recent infoDev Global Forum on innovation & technology Entrepreneurship held in South Africa.  

Here are ten tips for mobile start-ups and aspiring innovators to harness the wireless wave, and some suggestions for policymakers and larger industry players as well.  

# 1. Immerse yourself in your domain  

Founders should be deeply immersed in their domains to connect with citizens, customers and partners, and thus develop unique insights and design their products. you need a first person perspective to succeed.  

# 2. Don’t brand yourself just with technology  

Entrepreneurs should focus on clear problem areas but not bind themselves too strongly to one technology or platform alone. if you are an education service, don’t call yourself  

only an SmS platform because in a few years smartphone and tablet adoption will increase and you can go beyond SmS.  

# 3. Overcome fear of failure  

the fear of failure is driven into many South Asian families through our schools, parents and society at large – and is also related to punishment. Conditioning aspiring entrepreneurs to overcome fear will be an important part of nurturing innovators.  

# 4. Set the stage for directed as well as accidental innovation  

Not all innovations emerged as the result of systematic processes and strategy – some emerged quite by accident, such as the microwave oven, Post-it notes and consumer adoption of SmS. innovation organisations should set up conditions for directed as well as accidental innovation.  

# 5. Tap anecdotes and analytics to show impacts  

Startups need to master storytelling as well as quantitative measures to show the impact of their products and services. Not everything can be captured in numbers – but not everything can be captured in a story either.  

# 6. Angel funds  

there are many ‘do-gooders’ in society who would like to help support small tech startups, and the time is ripe for ‘crowd funding’ approaches for start-ups in South Asia. Some joke that typical angel sources are the 4 Fs: immediate family, friends, fools and fathers-in-law! At a larger scale, a number of countries are passing laws legalising crowd funding.  

# 7. Spreading innovation beyond big cities  

in many emerging economies, innovation hubs are emerging in major cities, but not beyond them. “Provincial innovation systems” are now bringing the start-up spirit to remote parts of the region as well, including tier 2 and tier 3 cities.  

# 8. Local content drives local innovation  

local languages are being increasingly supported at the information and device level. Having more tools, content and services in the local language can drive local innovation in South Asia.  

# 9. Advantage: Youth  

South Asia is blessed with a huge youth population who can do particularly well in digital innovation. many of these are ‘digital natives,’ and can use and create new digital tools. the emergence of cloud-based services and mobile social media are changing the way innovation happens in more advanced ways than even 15 years ago in the dotcom boom period.  

# 10. Tap local wisdom and roots  

South Asia is home to a rich base of cultural diversity, and  

was a major economic power in the pre-colonial era. tapping our deep roots can also drive a resurgence in the 21st century global digital economy.  

it would be fitting to end this write-up with a few indian proverbs which highlight entrepreneurial values of focus, drive, and learning from failures!  

if everybody pushes together even a mountain can be moved.

# Mobile Marketing Mantra  

# Milind Pathak  

tSBwuosltadanaidynsahboelfehtehrmeowJbauirslyefoiPncrcoulscuesdisoin, VAS / mCommerce / mGovernance / mHealth etc.  

i want to talk about one of the challenges that we have always faced and eventually discovered means to tackle is how "Brands / Agencies / Enterprises" could best use the mobile to reach out to its consumer. it is the Holy Grail of Connected Brand Presence that every brand manager would want his / her brand to have when it comes to talking to the consumer.  

What can we do with various brands and enterprises to smoothen their journey on this mobile internet / mobile first connected lifestyle of a consumer?  

# Customer Communication  

A whopping 850 million+ people in india have their mobile phones within reach right now.  they are communicating through voice, SmS, mobile internet or even via Apps many times daily. So it is a logical conclusion that  

With technologies such as Augmented Reality warming up the mobile scenario, brands will be all set to give their consumers an immersive experience.  

brands should use this easiest and on-the-go mode of communication with customers. However, reality begs to differ today. Brands are waking up to this potent medium, but not as fast as the consumers are adapting to it. this is one gap that we see getting filled in the times to come and hoping that more brands will earmark more funds for not just digital marketing, but mobile marketing will figure as a major head in the ad spends.  

# Experiential Mobile Marketing  

With technologies such as Augmented Reality warming up the mobile scenario, brands will be all set to give their consumers an immersive experience. through the use of interactions of mobile phones with digital signage, or with brand collateral displayed through various media, the consumers will become a part of the brand story. Now this experience is something they will not forget in a hurry, along with retention of the brand’s top of mind recall. most definitely worth being a piece of the mobile marketing budget pie!  

![](images/a29407eabd60fb075e2ea410f90a71fa6a45dbe96d67b547828f4c643dc227b5.jpg)  

# Mobile Presence  

Water water everywhere, but not a single drop to drink! this has so far been the case of brands’ mobile presence. mobile internet is right here, being used by the consumer. india in our view will be a 200 million internet user market by end of this year. this is another race in which the consumer may have beaten the marketers. on one hand are facts and figures such as: $50\%$ of mobile searches lead to purchase; $70\%$ mobile users compare product prices on their phones; while on the other is this grim scenario of far less than $90\%$ companies having a mobile optimized presence. this gap must change in the times to come. if companies are to benefit from this phenomenon, it is high time they optimize their mobile presence.  

wagon with their mobile first strategies in place? this is something to factor-in at the next strategy discussion.  

# Long-term Sustained Mobile Approach  

A long term mobile strategy is the future. those who adopt it first, will find themselves ahead in this race. this not only works out more economical than short bursts of campaigns, but also much more beneficial. once brands acquire and filter database over the first few campaigns, they can get on to the job of reaching and engaging niche customers and talking to them according to their paying power, interests, and history with the brand and more, thus ensuring total loyalty. this is certainly going to be a powerful tool in the hands of brand managers.  

# Mobile First Strategy  

Companies and brands can no longer ignore the potency of mobile as a medium. Until now the media or content strategy comprises of repackaging content already created for a different screen, be it television or internet. this again is going to change in the near future. more and more content makers will realize how to best create content to the specifications of the little screens and how their users can get a tremendous experience from it. A whole new boost to the mobile marketing and advertising space is coming up soon. the question is, are brands ready to get on to the bandmobile has always been said to be the most personal, intimate medium, which needs to be handled with lot of care and innovation. Any excessive interference from a Brand can also suggest an intrusion of private space of consumer. But a campaign which uses an optimum number of messages, using the right modes of delivery, will go a long way in building the confidence with the audience on its mobile interactions.

# Mobiles and communities

t would be inconceivable for most i young people born in the cell phone era to imagine a world without cell phones. Coming from a generation which saw the evolution of  

The current pace of apps across the human spectrum of experience is without doubt an unprecedented effort put into one focus device than any other technology in history by people across the globe.  

the phone from a desktop model to a “in pocket” device is a wonderful learning experience on how human experience drives societies to constantly create new paradigms in communications and finding ways to evolve and adapt to constant change.  

Even, those from a generation, such as i which used dial phones, cannot today do without the cell phone with two SimS and a testing android phone to constantly check the latest apps being churned out like lassi in a Punjabi dhabba. there is no turning back. We are well and truly caught in the digital future and have become part of digital technology with least resistance.  

the current pace of apps across the human spectrum of experience is without doubt an unprecedented effort put into one focus device than any other technology in history by people across the globe. From latin America to idli land developers are aiming to develop apps to address every aspect of life leaving no digital stone unturned and no area of life that they wish to bring into the digital handheld space. of course all this is driven by the dream of becoming the next billionaire with that “Killer”app which will go viral and transform lungis to boxer shorts. A digital culture evolving in fast forward...  

to address the many dimensions of life that apps are being to be developed for would require a book in its own space. this article will restrict to one evolving space, that of mobile technologies and knowledge communities of practice - “m C(K)ommunities”.  

most of us today are unaware that societies are evolving from information dissemination to knowledge sharing. From talk shops and list serves to knowledge enhancement and true communities of practice. A quick search even a rudiment search engine will through up numerous sites and communities of practice.  Almost all of them today have a mobile version of their web presence. the knowledge communities of today cannot hope to survive if they do not step out of the World Wide Web in the mobile footprint.

the mobile phone is the manna from heaven to those praying for a digital magic wand to reach the first mile and the last homosapien. the beauty of this boon is that the magic wand is held in the hand of anyone who can earn enough to buy the cheapest cell phone. it effectively gives a two and fro access to capture tacit knowledge at the grass root and be heard loud and clear in the hallowed conferences of policy makers.  

As we design new ways to evolve our knowledge engagement and create a knowledge pool for universal benefit, the mobile phone is the centerpiece of that communication methodology. it is the bow string which not only shoots the arrow into the future but also binds and brings in other parallel and historic communication technologies such as the radio to create a cohesive and unbeatable communication design reaching the ear of every user.  

of agricultural scientists with academic excellence and little practical experience.  Can this knowledge from the plough influence policy? Can a remote health functionary tap into a global knowledge repository with just a phone call? Can this be designed and be engineered? Without doubt it can.  there is without doubt the need to carefully design the way communities of practice function. it is exciting to know that there is the opportunity to reach and provide access to everyone on this planet in a large but cohesive knowledge mesh.  From policy makers to conceptional thinkers, to implementation agencies and the individual user and contributor can now be interlinked in a series of knowledge rings and meshes, all on a horizontal digital plane. truly the dawn of the mobile Knowledge communities (m-kommunities) era is upon us. How it is used and how it is nurtured to enable the fulfillment of the human spirit is the task before all of digital-kind.  

the answer in the past would be blowing in the wind but today the answer lies in the ring of your cell phone.  

the challenges of knowledge mangers who want to capture the real life experience and knowledge of that farmer in a remote field with an innovative solution to the doyens

# Social enterprise concept is consolidating  

# Dr. Ananya Raihan  

t the 40th anniversary of mobile phone, one can just wonder: was it possible to think  

The most important phenomenon is mobile is touching lives of millions of marginalized people.  

that mobile telephony would reach where it is today? Probably mobile telephony is one technology, which influenced our lives dramatically. mobile telephony is probably the most democratic of technologies in terms of reaching people around the globe through its affordability.  A mobile phone now aggregates a number of gadgets: still camera, video camera, PC with the internet, music player, video player, game console, calculator etc. this is one aspect of the revolution. Another aspect is mobile telephony brings many services on the finger tips: doing banking, buying all sorts of products, watching television, striking business deals, enforcing law and order, co-working across continent – the list is probably endless. However, the most important phenomenon is mobile is touching lives of millions of marginalized people. offering interactive and affordable education, reaching hardto-reach population with healthcare, offering government services, offering extension services to farmers, managing climatic and other disasters – all of these are now affected by mobile telephony.  

in this backdrop, mBillionth Award is a noble endeavor, which tries to recognize initiatives in South Asia, which can touch a billion population through innovations. it is very encouraging to see how the ideas and initiatives are getting matured over the years. Social enterprise concept is consolidating, where the innovative mobile phone based services are thinking to remain pro-poor at the same time financially viable. thus, innovations are not only taking place in the domain of technology, new models of business are merging, which were un-heard of.  

it was a humbling experience to become part of the Jury process. Brilliant minds came together and dedicated their time up to mid night to have thread-bearing discussions, which initiative to go for recognition. the celebration of creativity for changing lives probably is the key achievement of the mBillionth.

The marvel of the mobile is that it is available with almost all the people not like a PC and people are now matured to handle it. Citizen services provided by the mobile phone in some countries are marvelous.  

and for services. in order to encourage and bring out the talents of new innovations in the mobile sector m-Billionth Award is a good opportunity. this is only for the South Asian Region and the Jury had the opportunity to view and experiment very innovative applications developed by the people in the region. it varied from individuals to big companies. the product quality was very impressive. this made it a difficult task to select few best from a category because lot of applications were so good.  

the marvel of the mobile is that it is available with almost all the people not like a PC and people are now matured to handle it. Citizen services provided by the mobile phone in some countries are marvelous. the health sector, education sector, ecommerce & business sector and many other sectors has developed so many valuable applications that people can easily access via the mobile. Children can access information on their studies, rural women can easily learn and the mode of learning is fun that makes them grasp this technology. in the health sector also i experienced large number of innovative applications on the information, medication and care for the mother/child and on several illnesses. Since people now use the mobile to access the web and download applications mobile has become “the” most common form of communication media.  

i value the South Asian mBillionth Award and hope that the most outstanding applications will be used in their respective countries (some are already in use for some years) and will make life easier for the citizens in the region.  

i take this opportunity to wish all the winners a successful journey ahead with their innovations and Good luck to mBillionth organizers.

# The Jury process: Incisive and insightful  

# Amir Ullah Khan  

W hat makes for a good jury? this has been a question that has forever been asked in the legal   
profession. Should the jury comprise   
twelve or thirteen wise men? the ques  
tion then changed with some gender em  

powerment ad started including women. Should a jury comprise thirteen lay persons? or should it only include specialists who understand the subject being debated? Does it necessarily require people with legal or scientific backgrounds or people who simply understand the basics and natural principles of justice?  

Who should judge films and documentaries? Are popular awards better than those judged by critics? Should those who judge have previous experience in the field, should they have been participants in the contest themselves? Should the jury look at pure quantitative measures, or should it evaluate the contestants on subjective and qualitative parameters? Should jurors get the opportunity to influence their fellow jury persons or should each one be isolated?  

What guides the entire exercise is a strong belief in each decision being a collective one. Jurors are allowed to blatantly argue for entries they themselves feel strongly about. So long as they have no commercial or professional interests there.  

these are the various questions that we at mBillionth and the manthan awards grapple with each time we collect to judge a fascinating new set of entries. Some entries are blatantly commercial, yet serve a social purpose better than most others. Some are fresh off the block and while they hold great promise, show little evidence of filed success. Some persistent contestants surface again and again, a few of them who have successfully participated in previous rounds and few who have consistently failed to impress the jury.  

Each time we go through the process we realise how the jury evolves. the various nuances of conflicts of interests or ideological biases, of regional influences and of individual preferences come into the discussion and pose serious problems. the jury typically consists of a few old timers who have been though the process a few times, a few who are absolutely new to the process, a couple who have contested and won the award in previous years and the rest who are technically the best in the business of digital and mobile media.

What guides the entire exercise is a strong belief in each decision being a collective one. Jurors are allowed to blatantly argue for entries they themselves feel strongly about. So long as they have no commercial or professional interests there. the idea is that they should be able to convince a bunch of extremely strong willed individuals who are however willing to be persuaded. it is through this vigorous and robust debate that the eventual winner is decided. the process of nomination, shortlisting and discussion then takes care of a number of issues discussed earlier in this note.  

Each year, the jury goes through some of the most fascinating insights into what a developing country needs as seen through the lens of service providers working in various parts of the region. While some ideas are innovative in their sheer efficiency of delivery others are brilliant concepts in upstream design and development. While the good old philosophy of earnest debate producing the winner ensures objectivity in the exercise, what is most gratifying at a personal level is the exposure to these completely new sets of ideas and concepts.

# Thought from 2013 mBillionth Award Jury  

# Sushil Pandey  

had the pleasure to be part of the grand jury team of the $2013{\mathrm{~mBil}}-$ - lionth Award. i was also there in last year’s jury. Again, it was inspiring   
to observe the creative solutions put for  
ward to address different developmental   
challenges using mobile as a means and   
making a difference to people and their  

livelihood. the richness, depth and variety of applications speak themselves of the power and potential of mobile applications. i can see the quality of applications also getting better comparatively, perhaps now there are more and more people getting involved in this ecosystem, which has added value to raise the quality bar and also pushed competitive feeling.  

the two days that i experienced was an utter qualitative time spent with the jury members and the DEF team. What appears in the award book as winners in different categories is the outcome of hours of intense discussion, scrutiny and introspection by the jury over the nominations. the nominations submitted had a wide range of ideas and solutions, and it was also a personal learning experience to witness great innovations that they have put in. Besides the  

Besides the normal usage of applications in common verticals like governance, health, education, entertainment I must also concede that the innovators through their nominations have been responding to the emerging needs of the society as well and not only remain supply driven.  

normal usage of applications in common verticals like governance, health, education, entertainment i must also concede that the innovators through their nominations have been responding to the emerging needs of the society as well and not only remain supply driven.  

As one concrete area that i want to highlight to support my above assertion is the provision of mobile applications to protect women.  i do remember there were so many mobile applications developed and nominated on safeguarding women and help prevent violent against them, namely – Fightback, trishulam,  HelPls, Safety shield, etc. it must have been prompted also from horrible bus rape case in Delhi, besides the need to empower women. Such simple and extremely useful tool for women to feel safer and more secure, are only a couple of clicks away, in fact in one app it was even driven by a mere motion of a mobile – perhaps many apps in future would use this relatively newer user interface. most of them sent the user’s location via GPS to pre-set contacts along with an SmS message with one push of a button, and it can also be linked to Facebook and twitter. As mobile phones become more prevalent even in rural and mountainous areas, these solutions can offer care, information, help and protection to women and girls across countries and cultures. While currently, many of these apps are available only for smartphones, which limits their availability and usability, i would be glad to see these services supporting and protecting women through very simple and basic SmS services, using local languages, which do not require a smart phone, or even an internet connection.

As a final point, hats off to DEF and the mBillionth award team for they deserve all glory for getting the work done efficiently and the trust they put into collective wisdom through the jury members. mBillionth award is truly an event showcasing mobile for masses and offers platform to nominees to present their innovations and to awardees to provide additional impetus to continue their objective of ensuring continuous inclusive growth and services to masses.

ne of Nokia’s strategic goals is to enable information access for the “Next Billion” users and Nokia life is an integral part of this initiative. this service  

Nokia Life has been built by a team that immersed itself in rural and semi-urban conditions and did extensive research to understand how people lead their lives.  

has been built ground up for the emerging markets and focuses on livelihood and life improvement, delivering information vital to the daily lives of millions across developing societies. it addresses information gaps in topics of relevance across Education, Health, Agriculture and Entertainment. launched first in india in July 2009, it has successfully expanded to China, indonesia, Kenya, tanzania and Nigeria.  

the Nokia life application is pre-embedded in the Nokia mobile phone, saving users the need to download a separate application to access information. the content is hyperlocal and personalized and most importantly, disseminated in the user’s own language. in india, this service is available 11 regional languages and English. the application has a dedicated inbox to receive this content with a firstof-its-kind easy to browse graphical interface.  

many consumers in india do not have access to quality information which can impact their livelihood and life. Current modes of information access are mostly fragmented or dated and hence ineffective. Nokia solves that problem by bridging qualified information sources with those who need it in a timely manner. Nokia works closely with telecom operators ensuring nationwide coverage and distribution. this integration also facilitates interactivity from the device to Nokia life servers, enabling 2-way communication.  

Nokia life has been built by a team that immersed itself in rural and semi-urban conditions and did extensive research to understand how people lead their lives, the kind of information services they were currently using and changes they wanted to see. the nature of services offered – ones which relate to personal aspirations and address immediate challenges – present a real opportunity to support and develop the users throughout their lives.  

![](images/489f77a09bfdddde3baac5b0154bf758a667ad2fccf6dddda7e5233d2ec5ee62.jpg)  

Nokia ensures that the content is relevant and actionable to achieve maximum impact. the approach has been to create an ecosystem of partners who have invaluable expertise in the relevant fields of Education, Agriculture and Health Care. these include Government agencies, NGos, Universities, Research institutes and industry players.  

Research has shown that “living Healthy” as a concept has a universal appeal and gaps are mainly around awareness regarding hygiene, nutrition and available health facilities. Nokia’s Healthcare service provides tips on fitness, wellbeing & disease prevention. it also guides pregnant mothers and parents in handling those responsibilities.  

the agricultural sector is a critical component of the indian economy and with the climatic and crop diversity across india, it is a challenge to keep farmers informed about agricultural best practices. lack of timely information also affects their ability to get better income by selling produce at the best price. Nokia life’s Agriculture services provide farmers with personalised information pertaining to market prices of nearest mandis, local news, crop advisory and important information on schemes and subsidies. 24-hour weather forecasts are also provided.  

Nokia life Education services are designed to help users improve their personal and academic performance through services such as learn English, General Knowledge, life Skills, Exam tips and teacher training. Partnerships with universities like iGNoU allow users to take certification courses.  

to further drive adoption of these services, Nokia invites both government and private organizations to be part of this ecosystem in empowering citizens and influencing change.

# The Implementation of m-Government at Local level

The growth of mobile phones offers huge potential to drive social change. For many the mobile provides crucial access to information and knowledge for the first time at an affordable cost.  

n today’s world, mobile phones   
i hgraovwe inbgecnoumebearsnienceisnsdiitay  baenadr ttehsetimony to it.  latest count stands at   
over 664 million cellphone users across  

the country with over $33\%$ of the rural population owning a handset.  

the growth of mobile phones offers huge potential to drive social change. For many the mobile provides crucial access to information and knowledge for the first time at an affordable cost. People who are unable to read or write can find out real time what is happening beyond their communities and share their own news and information at the same time. this provides new opportunities for education and learning, deliverables in health, improvements in governance, the possibility of inclusion, livelihood generation and much more.  

the Vodafone Foundation is committed to support initiatives within the voluntary sector that do just that.  this is the third year of our successful Award programme, in association with Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) in india. over the last two years, the impact from the crucial funding and mentorship provided to the 9 NGos has been tremendous. one example to mention is Kisan Sanchar, a winner from 2011.  With the funding provided, they have been able to scale their operations having setup of call centre to respond to requests for localised agricultural information to a network of over 62,000 farmers through mobiles across india.  

As a member of the jury, i was part of the privileged team tasked with evaluating these best practice NGos. it is exciting to see the level of innovations that NGos are embracing through technology. one of this year’s nominee CGnet Swara proves the power of mobile to improve governance at a local level in Jharkhand. People can easily express their views on issues at the local level by simply calling a local number provided by CGnet Swara using their mobile phone. this is then captured on a database for lobbying by the NGo with local level authorities for better administration.

the mobile for Good theme has generated compelling stories of how Vodafone’s technology is helping deliver transformational change in the community. to date, we have launched several exciting initiatives in india.  to highlight, we are working with SEWA and the Cherie Blair Foundation in Gujarat to enable rural women entrepreneurs to manage their business using mobile. this has enabled them to make more money, become more efficient and spend time with their families.  

With the rapid pace of mobile development and evolving innovation on our doorsteps, it is challenging to identify the best practice mobile solutions from the charity sector. However, our learnings and experience from the last three years indicate that we are working in the right direction in achieving the goal of using mobile for Good.

# Mint: An integrated newsroom for the reader  

# R. Sukumar  

tjousronralimsismu,sbedutasnothne iansteignrsaitdeidprobably journalism’s equivalent of the corporate world’s “innovation” or “breakthrough”.  

So, rather than tell you all about how we have now become an integrated newsroom—we have—i’d like to share with you my mental image of how a person gets to know of, engages with, follows, and reacts to the news.  

i’d like to think of anyone who reads or sees anything put out by the mint newsroom as a smart person for two reasons: one, it is probably true; two, it keeps me sharp. Now, smart people have read something, watched something or surfed something in the morning before they head to work; have news channels running on mute in their offices so that they can keep an eye on the ticker; scan their Facebook walls and Twitter timelines at least once an hour and click on any links to interesting news; visit news websites every couple of hours; read long-form articles in magazines and newspapers when they get the time; or do a bit of everything.  

It means the extensive use of multimedia, including video. It means reaching out to people on a variety of devices (phones, tablets) through apps and a dynamic website.  

it stands to reason that if a newsroom wants to stay relevant to its readers, then it too should do a bit of everything, or, as i have discovered, a lot of everything.  

there was a time when newsrooms could do this by simply hiring separate teams to do each of these: one to run the newspaper or magazine; another to produce videos; a third to run the website. that doesn’t make sense now for several reasons, the most important of which is economics. So, smart newsrooms have a few specialists (such as visual editors and graphic artists) doing specialized tasks among a larger population of reporters and editors who work across media.  

For this to work, a newsroom needs to have the equivalent of an ERP—software that can run the entire newsroom and feed into multiple devices, apart from generating files for the printing press.  

![](images/68b2d75ee9dcbf8a41afb331dd02777dba8e305652a3333cc0941ba007546bcf.jpg)  

And for this to work, a newsroom needs to adapt or change its processes and behaviour.  

What does this mean for the reader?  

it means stories are broken first on the website, and updated continuously if they merit updates.   
it means opinion and analysis pieces, too, appear first on the Web, soon after a big event, so that the readers can understand what it means.   
it means the extensive use of social media to amplify stories, engage with readers, and also, in some cases, to constantly provide updates on developing-by-theminute stories.  

devices (phones, tablets) through apps and a dynamic website.  

it means producing a paper that factors in everything we have done in the past 12 hours and understanding what makes most sense for readers, sometimes a full 18 hours after the original news has broken. And it means doing all this without compromising our integrity or high journalistic standards.  

At the mint newsroom, most of these elements are already in place (the last one has been in place a long time) and others will happen with time.  

it means the extensive use of multimedia, including video. it means reaching out to people on a variety of

At the very outset, a platform is needed that would integrate back-end data from any secure source and deliver it to the mobile devices that function on multiple networks and operating systems. Data gathered by the mobile applications can be useful to many people inside and outside of the walls of the institution. However, controlling user access is necessary to protect employee and student information, as well as to protect institutional properties, in the case of device theft or loss. Creation of the mobile enterprise-level apps with an interactive interface will drive business process performance and student outreach to connect in situations like never before.  

Glocal University is based on the strict ethics of a well-knit integrated education experience for all its students across its different Schools. our education system is presently at  

Today’s teachers and students are dynamic and technology savvy and they love to access learning resources from anywhere, anytime.  

the tip of a revolution as the conventional methods of learning and teaching are being rapidly replaced by high-tech learning and training. today’s teachers and students are dynamic and technology savvy and they love to access learning resources from anywhere, anytime. this has redefined the trend of delivering learning solutions that adopt mobile and telecom solutions as a key tool and promises to enable effective and powerful mobile coaching and learning experiences. We at Glocal aim to achieve an integrated strategy by furthering mobile and telecom solutions in higher education ecosystem and enable better collaboration and sharing among faculty and students for meaningful interactions. We give our mobility strategy the same level of importance as our other it strategies because of its ever growing requirements and immense potential.  

in our overall aim to develop the modern education system, mobile technology would enable the capture of content (e.g., lectures or study material), resources and engaging conversations, which contributes to the ongoing learning and support beyond the scope of the conventional classroom. After gathering the learning resources and interactions, these would be easily distributed through the internet and mobile technology to the students, which enables the concept of anytime, anywhere access to the learning material. mobility will take the interactions between the students and instructors beyond the classroom while allowing them to manage and modify the learning resources and share them on the go. With the mobile technology, collaboration would be based on real and practical ideas rather than based on information. the combination of the mobile devices and social media will open the new doors of opportunities for the students to contribute to the contents, progress and results of the course by allowing the integration of the new ideas to take the course to its next level. the emergence of m-learning thus opens up new doors of opportunities, which easily address the critical challenges and issues of learning systems and have made learning more effective, responsive and transformative, which we embrace at Glocal.

ise. the sector's impact on the economy   
can be gauged from a World Bank-led  

study that stated that a $10\%$ increase in mobile penetration can lead to an additional $0.81\%$ growth in GDP, while an india-specific study led by iCRiER concluded that the SDP rises by $1.2\%$ for every $10\%$ increase in mobile teledensity.  

At PwC, our telecom experts draw on a wide range of experience in india and across the globe to offer a comprehensive portfolio of services across Advisory, tax, Regulation and Audit, each in turn being a basket of finely defined deliverables, helping organisations and individuals create the value they’re looking for.  

one of the key focus areas in the firm has been the increasing levels of connectivity in day-to-day life enabled through mobile technology. How will this impact our daily lives?

in order to link women with financial services and to secure their future, SEWA in collaboration with the State Bank of india began a project of Financial inclusion in 2009. Under the ambit of this project, women are appointed as Customer Service Point (CSP) with the clear objective of acting as a medium of providing banking services. A GPRS enabled phone and a portable Point of Service (PoS) are required with which the customers’ identities are recorded and subsequently uploaded to SBi’s mumbai server. For the purpose of opening a zero balance account, a Customer Service Point (CSP) comes to the doorstep of the customer with a bank form with a unique code for subsequent customer identification, a mobile phone and a Point of Service (PoS) machine. Using the camera of the mobile phone, the customer’s photograph is taken and saved thereafter the voice of the customer is recorded.  

the PoS machine, powered by A little Word, records the fingerprint of the customer. the mobile phone has an application installed which facilitates the banking services of the program. Customer’s ration card number or any other relevant iD card number is to be entered on the application to complete the necessary requirements. once the prerequisites are fulfilled, the recorded data is uploaded to the State Bank of india’s mumbai server. For any transactions, voice-match and fingerprint-match is imperative.

ZipDial enables marketers and advertisers to transform their brand campaigns into highly interactive and viral over mobile. Advertisers use ZipDial numbers in their advertisements as call to actions, which any end user can dial in and that become the starting point for interactions.  

Simple interfaces like a missed call to ZipDial numbers, ensures interactions from 100 percent of the customers -smart or feature phone users, kids or adults, urban or rural dwellers. End users see the zipdial number in advertisements of brands, they dial (missed call) and receive SmS, iVR or other such engagements over mobile. ZipDial is also used for cash on delivery confirmations via missed calls or mobile number verification via missed calls during sign-ups on websites.  

ZipDial is an innovation to address two problem areas: First, advertisers don't get granular data on consumer preferences owing to low internet, smart phone and payment data penetration. Secondly, end user don't get anything personlized; messages are more generic around Cricket, Bollywood and Spam. Similar scenario is in markets like Africa, Sri lanka (where it recently launched in April 2013) and South East Asia.

ZipDial is a marketing and analytics platform for mobile marketing via missed calls. Brand managers use it to drive exceptionally higher customer engagement. ZipDial took the typical mobile VAS model, flipped it upside down, and made the user-experience simple and free for $100\%$ of consumers (based on ‘missed calls’).

in the Nilgiris district of tamil Nadu, Adivasi tea leaf growers are served by Atlm, a tribal organisation that buys their fresh leaf and sells to processing companies. Atlm, which used to work with paper receipt books and registers, has successfully implemented a mobile app for processing the orders and ingesting them into the database in a paperless workflow. the real achievement here is that the entire solution was designed, tested and rolled out by an all-adivasi team using the open Data Kit!  

WWW http://adivasi.net  

it was found that modern android devices are quite capable machines, and the ecosystem thriving with a massive range of apps and capabilities. the main purpose of this project was to demonstrate that with a little support and capacity building, communities can harness their own imagination and will to effect positive change. the AmS and ACCoRD strive to empower the Adivasis of the Nilgiris, rather than provide them with ready-made solutions.  

By putting the reins in the hands of the Adivasis right from the beginning, this project was born sustainable. With just the right nurturing and support, this project has grown quickly and rapidly with little heavy-handed intervention on our part. By delegating even duties such as training to the Adivasis, the programme achieved a level of adoption that usually requires far more extensive hand-holding.

As a community radio (CR), Radio Namaskar has taken mobile phone as the primary tool for direct access to the community and interacting online. there was a massive drop-out of school students especially girl students in its coverage area. Basing upon these observations, Radio Namaskar decided to start a radio programme to motivate and mobilize all drop-out students back to their respective schools. As per this decision, a jingle was broadcast to motivate the parents to send their children to school.  

Since most of the listeners now use mobile as a tool of communication and also to listen Fm radio and realizing that they don't prefer to ring a landline number which comes out to be expensive for mobile users, they started announcing the mobile number that is dedicated for the purpose. then response from listeners grew day by day.  

the objective of this Community Radio is to ensure overcoming social problems through a community owned process and through deployment of oriented personnel and sensitizing the beneficiary mass. Radio Namaskar has a total coverage in Gop, Nimapara, Astarang and Kakatpur Blocks of Puri district and also reaches in other surrounding locations.  

Recently it has started a campaign m-Janata with focus on issues related to governance and service delivery system in community.

mobile phones have become the most pervasive and ubiquitous mode for connecting and interacting. in india, phones are essentially used for voice calls and SmS. Voice Rti allows citizens to interact with the relevant democratic representatives and governance machinery via Voice calls.  

the citizens of a city will be able to interact with their elected representatives via an automated call-in and play-back internet- integrated Voice Response (iVR) system. the iVR system allows citizens to directly ask questions to their elected by recording a 3min question automatically posted as a VoiceRti on the website for the other citizens to listen to and participate in that issue. there will also be moderation and back-end processing on the voice message done where it will be correctly categorized in the online system.  the VoiceRtis can be channeled to elected representatives who will be asked for responses, commitments. these will then be made available via the play-back service component of the system where citizens can call in and listen to responses.  

the potential of project to influence and galvanize other formal/informal citizen groups and platforms such as housing societies, student groups, NGo’s, think tanks, journalists, citizen’s from under privileged neighborhood, political scientists, and teachers had been immense. the direct quantitative impact in terms of service users in mumbai is expected to be approximately 1.0 to 1.5 lakh citizens over an annual cycle.

LaborVoices is a mobile-phone based portal turning worker feedback into labor-market intelligence. This crowdsourced supply-chain intelligence solves two big problems facing global workers and corporate brands with a single, appropriate solution. The service makes it easy for factory employees to anonymously report on working conditions.  

laborVoices is a mobile phone portal turning worker feedback into labor market intelligence. the system provides an informational and financial incentive to user base— intelligence source—supply chain workers. it then sells supply chain intelligence to major consumer brands, priced to complement—then supplant—inspection-based monitoring. this solution helps companies to tighten their supply chains and protect capital, helping best-in-class supplier factories to lower turnover and stand out through fair metrics, and helping supply chain workers to fact-check future jobs and maintain a steady income.  

Founder, Dr. Kohl Gill, was inspired to create laborVoices while on a trade and labor delegation to Sri lanka and Bangladesh as part of the State Department’s labor Rights and CSR office.  

“i noticed that most workers had mobile phones, but none of them were using them to avoid abusive labor practices,” says Gill. “i thought that there ought to be a way to connect workers with each other, to allow them to report their working conditions, and drive other workers toward the best employers.” improved access to labor market information helps the workers’ quality of life. Brands pay suppliers a premium to implement their codes of conduct.

HySAWA is an international NGo, funded by DANiDA, for large-scale delivery of WASH services in rural Bangladesh.  the goal is to contribute to poverty reduction through improved and sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene services. it has installed approximately 30,000 tubewells in around 300 unions.  

this application has been initiated for rural people who depend fully on a tube well for drinking water. this innovation was about to reduce lead time for repairing a tubewell. Usually a tubewell would require 20 days lead time to repair when damaged. Now from the tubewells in the project an SmS is generated by an appointed caretaker to a server [web control panel]. then the information runs to a mechanique who will repair the tubewell through Hysawa. then the mechanique runs towards the spot and repairs the tubewell in 24 hours.  

this procedure is maintained by SmS application and used through Grameenphone Network only. SmS from the local coordinator to a specific port and then an automatic alert is generated. Detailed are presented in the presentation attached.  

At this moment the target market is in underprivileged rural areas where more than $80\%$ of the country's live and only source of drinking water is tubewells.

in the world of high processing tablets, smartphones, and 4G internet connection, there are various ways to collect data and disseminate information. But when it comes to providing technology to people with limited resources and low literacy in remote rural areas of a developing country like india, the only reliable and accessible interface is a basic mobile phone.

Using iVR Junction, local communities can achieve agile, scalable, robust and secure multi-way communication that transcends economic and literacy limitations. Unlike prior tools, iVR Junction runs on a Windows platform and can be easily configured by anyone with a laptop and modem. moreover, iVR Junction fosters multi-way communication: affected populations can record and listen to posts via a mobile phone, while the global internet audience can access and contribute recordings via youtube, Facebook, and other social media. this hybrid system enables a distributed architecture that is flexible, secure, and robust to the many challenges inherent in the developing world.  

in recent years, iVR systems have spanned diverse domains, including citizen news journalism, agricultural discussion forums, community dialogue, user-generated maps, access to health information, outreach to sex workers, group messaging, feedback on school meals, support for community radio stations, rural employment exchange, and a viral entertainment platform.

Netcore, in association with mPCB (maharashtra Pollution Control Board) has done 3 major Voice Based Campaigns in the last year on World Environment Day, Diwali & Holi. the Government Department used Voice Based activity. Earlier, the Government used traditional media like Radio, Print, television and SmS to propagate these campaigns; which did less in garnering attention from the people.  the campaign encouraged people to go green, cut lesser trees, avoid using polluting crackers during Diwali and thereby containing Sound & Air Pollution and to play a waterless Holi (2013) as the state of maharashtra is going through one of the worst droughts. these messages were received by the general public as an incoming call on their mobile phones. the response to these campaigns was tremendous with Diwali 2012 being considered as one of the quietest one; also, the campaign results of Holi 2013 showed decreased usage of water consumption, lesser axing of trees, and increased use of eco-friendly colours.  

location Based Field Guide: Based on the user's current location, it will show all the wildlife (and associated notes) that has been observed by our community nearby. in this fashion, the user can learn about the nature nearby. this is mobile learning as the experience will change depending on where you are and where you decided to launch the app.  

objectives: • to spread awareness about the Environmental causes across the state of maharashtra. $\cdot$ to cover all the occasions where environmental issues can be addressed to people at one go. (e.g. Stopping wastage of water during Holi – Due to the serious drought situation in some of the regions of maharashtra state)

CommCare, Dimagi's flagship mHealth platform, expands the technical capacity of ASHAs and the quality of their services. it increases worker motivation, providing a powerful set of tools for monitoring, supervising, and supporting ASHAs. it replaces cumbersome paper registers, forms, and flipcharts with an open source, customizable software application housed on a mobile phone.

SmS gateway based reporting by public health services has facilitated the reporting at Public Health Centre level and Public Health Department in maharashtra to provide support in critical areas. in case of water supply by tankers, before implementation of SmS service to citizens, contractors used to divert the water meant for the villages to commercial purposes and citizens were deprived of needed supply of water. Since SmS is sent every time tanker was sent to any village to 50 prominent villagers, it has become very difficult to divert the water tanker anywhere else. Similarly in the case of Food and Civil supplies, villages get advance notice about the supply of food grains meant for Fair Price Shops. there is no need of high end gadgets for this solution.  maharashtra, government also developed web based self-seeding application.  

As part of m-Governance, Government of maharashtra developed various apps based on the tablets like: 1.Enrolment Centre Survey App 2.UiD connect App for door to door seeding of UiD with various department databases 3.QR code based self-data entry of enrollment data like demographic details which will reduce the time taken for completing the enrolment.  

in this web based application in combination of simple smart phone app, resident can just enter data and either take print out of the QR code or just scan and store the QR code in mobile.

# Jurors GRAFFITI  

there is a wide variety of applications from small scale to big scale organisations. the social impact of all these projects are high so sometimes as a juror it is hard to choose which one is best as all of them are equally good.  

Indumini  

it is an exciting experience to be part of mBillionth jury as you get the chance to meet people from all over South Asia. it is good to see that these applications are more mature that result in a positive impact on a grassroots level.  

the nominations are extremely relevant and intense. the process of selecting a winner this time is going to be much more difficult as the quality of nominations is very high.  

# Milind Pathak  

this is my second time as a jury for mBillionth. this experience is an opportunity to always learn new things. these nominations highlight the multiple use of a mobile phone. Some of these applications help the under privilege community in rural areas as well as the working class in urban areas.  i think it is brilliant how mBillionth can highlight these success stories.  

# Ananya Raihan  

it was really interesting to discuss different issues with the other jury members. For example in the travel category we saw a lot of big players as well as new entries in this space. it is interesting to see how mobile apps have solved problems in a unique and different way.  

there have been lots of applications in terms of categories covered so far. it is encouraging to see so many dynamic applications for example in m-health we have lots of strong entries. it is wonderful to be part of it.  

Laura Turkington i have been in india for 2 yrs and i feel mBillionth award is an enriching experience as this gives me the opportunity to look at inspiring applications of mobile technology. Some of these applications have a commercial impact and some of them have a social impact but all of them show these innovative ideas which are impacting in india as well as other countries.  

# Mohammad Chowdhury  

i am very happy to be part of mBillionth jury as i can see the transparency in the selection process of applications. the decision making process is totally democratic and our main focus in on quality.  i would suggest that going to colleges and universities will give exposure to new upcoming entrepreneurs and encourage them to participate.  

# Debabrata Goswami  

i am coming from an industrial focused background being part of mBillionth has given me an eye opening experience. it is fascinating to see how mobile innovation even in small countries like Bangladesh and Nepal has a big influence in their communities.  

# Arjun Basu  

one of the primary reasons why i decided to be part of mBillionth jury is the width and diversity of applications. For me it gives me a better understanding of our eco-system and where its needs to be worked on.  

# Pranshu Singhal  

one thing i would like to highlight is the quality of applications coming from different backgrounds e.g. NGo’s, corporates & entrepreneurs. We have taken a holistic picture when we vote for these applications. it has been a terrific experience.  

Being a juror for mBillionth it has provided me an insight on mobile intervention that is out there. it is a challenging experience to compare the applications to each other because i think all of them have a tremendous amount of merit. in the end you have to make a judgement call whether it has a practical effects, does it have value, do people use it and if the idea has been implemented. this has given me an opportunity for a better understanding of mobile growth in South Asia.  

N. Ramakrishnan the jury process would be better if there is a brain’s trust where people who are knowledgeable are given criteria by which these applications should be judged. i think having marks for each criterion is a problem. i don’t think we can justify those marks because the amount of time we spent on them and the nature of the information.  

# Mahesh Uppal  

What this country unfortunately suffering from is a lot of pilot projects with no grand scale success. i think what these awards can lead to is connect with the right network to fill in the gap. it is an opportunity to mentor these organisations as well.
