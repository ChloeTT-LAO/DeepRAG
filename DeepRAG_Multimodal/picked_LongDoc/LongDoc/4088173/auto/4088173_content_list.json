Finally, international donors must play a role in ensuring there is a balance between players, they must help reduce the negative effects of the mobile phone sector and – at the same time – make sure its developmental impacts are maximized. they must also provide their financial support to the expansion of broadband connections in order to give easier access to internet, which would appear to be an even more important factor for economic growth in South Asian countries than the mobile phone itself.

Such simple and extremely useful tool for women to feel safer and more secure, are only a couple of clicks away, in fact in one app it was even driven by a mere motion of a mobile – perhaps many apps in future would use this relatively newer user interface. most of them sent the user’s location via GPS to pre-set contacts along with an SmS message with one push of a button, and it can also be linked to Facebook and twitter. As mobile phones become more prevalent even in rural and mountainous areas, these solutions can offer care, information, help and protection to women and girls across countries and cultures. While currently, many of these apps are available only for smartphones, which limits their availability and usability, i would be glad to see these services supporting and protecting women through very simple and basic SmS services, using local languages, which do not require a smart phone, or even an internet connection.

After gathering the learning resources and interactions, these would be easily distributed through the internet and mobile technology to the students, which enables the concept of anytime, anywhere access to the learning material. mobility will take the interactions between the students and instructors beyond the classroom while allowing them to manage and modify the learning resources and share them on the go. With the mobile technology, collaboration would be based on real and practical ideas rather than based on information. the combination of the mobile devices and social media will open the new doors of opportunities for the students to contribute to the contents, progress and results of the course by allowing the integration of the new ideas to take the course to its next level. the emergence of m-learning thus opens up new doors of opportunities, which easily address the critical challenges and issues of learning systems and have made learning more effective, responsive and transformative, which we embrace at Glocal.

Called mobile Kunji, it is designed to be used by community health workers (CHWs) during their counselling sessions with families. it consists of a printed deck of cards and an audio component that can be accessed via short codes. mobile Kunji brings together an iVR-based mobile service and a virtually indestructible deck of 40 illustrated cards on a ring. Each card has a unique mobile shortcode printed on it, which corresponds to a specific audio health message. When a health worker dials the number, they can play the health message – voiced by a character called Dr Anita, an engaging but authoritative female doctor – to the family via their mobile phone. ",
