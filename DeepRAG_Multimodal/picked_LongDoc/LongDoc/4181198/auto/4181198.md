# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

# Purpose and Approach  

King County levies a one tenth of one percent sales tax known as the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) sales tax to support mental health and chemical dependency treatment and therapeutic programs and services. As required by Ordinance 15949, to measure the effectiveness of the programs funded by MIDD, the King County Department of Community and Human Services (DCHS) conducts evaluations that describe how MIDD funding is spent and report on a set of required output and outcome measures for each MIDD strategy.  

This report, as required by King County Metropolitan Council Ordinance 17998, presents the results of a comprehensive assessment of the MIDD evaluations conducted from 2008-2015. The assessment was conducted by the King County Office of Performance, Strategy and Budget (PSB). The report identifies strengths and weaknesses of the MIDD evaluations and offers recommendations for future evaluations of MIDD.  

The assessment is based on the results of 30 stakeholder interviews, a review and comparison of evaluation documents, a review of current practices in behavioral health evaluations, and evaluation best practices.  

# Overview  

# MIDD adoption and implementation  

Ordinance 15949, adopted by the Council in 2007, authorized the collection of the MIDD sales tax, established five policy goals to guide the development of MIDD implementation and called for the development of three separate plans:  

An Oversight Plan guiding the establishment of a group responsible for oversight of the MIDD action plan.   
An Implementation Plan describing the   
implementation of the programs and services outlined in the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan, including a schedule for implementation; a   
discussion of needed resources; a spending and   
financial plan; and milestones for implementation of the programs.   
An Evaluation Plan describing an evaluation and   
reporting plan, including a process and outcome   
evaluation component; a proposed schedule for   
evaluations; output and outcome measures and   
measure targets; and data elements that would be used for reporting and evaluations.  

# What is evaluation?  

Evaluation has been standard practice in health and human services for many years. Evaluation is a mechanism for learning what is and is not working, for providing information to be used in quality improvement efforts, and for demonstrating value of spending.  Decision makers may use evaluation results to determine whether a program should be adjusted, expanded or defunded based on its effectiveness in achieving outcomes.  

The basis of any evaluation is the evaluation framework, which defines how programs being evaluated connect to desired outcomes. In an evaluation framework, measures are selected that demonstrate the connection between programs and outcomes, which allows tracking progress towards established targets and adjustments to programs not meeting targets.  

# How MIDD works today  

The 2008 MIDD Implementation Plan is organized around five service areas subdivided into 37 different strategies. Each strategy is implemented through one or more programs that provide services for clients. Services are delivered either through County-based programs or through community-based programs contracted by the County.  

The MIDD Evaluation Plan outlines the intent to monitor and evaluate the MIDD strategies. It consists of three evaluation components:  

1. System Process Evaluation to describe how the implementation of MIDD is progressing.   
2. Strategy Process Evaluation to assess what was done based on the performance goals specified in the Evaluation Plan’s evaluation matrix (Appendix D).   
3. Outcome Evaluation to assess the effect of MIDD strategies on MIDD policy goals (Appendix C) and other expected results.  

The results of the MIDD evaluation work are published twice a year in a MIDD Annual Report that summarizes the findings of the most recent October-September time period and a mid-year Progress Report that summarizes the findings of the most recent October-March time period. The reporting periods for MIDD were established in 2008 in Ordinance 16262.  

# MIDD Evaluation Assessment Findings and Recommendations  

This section summarizes the key findings and recommendations of this report. These findings and recommendations are based on opinions and expertise of interviewees, document reviews, best practices research, and staff conducting this assessment. The table on the following page contains a summary of the key strengths identified in this assessment as well as identified challenges and associated recommendations to address these challenges. More context, explanation, and examples of how these strengths and challenges were identified and the details of each recommendation are included in the body of the report  

Note: Key evaluation terms in the summary table below are defined in the glossary on page 9.  

When reading this report, it is important to keep in mind that the assessment compares MIDD evaluations conducted between 2008 and 2015 to (1) the MIDD Evaluation Plan adopted by the King County Council in 2008; (2) current expectations of stakeholders, which may not have been the same in 2008; and (3) to current practices in behavioral health care evaluation, which is a continually evolving field. Therefore, in some cases the findings reflect gaps between the original evaluation plan and its implementation, but other times they reflect how expectations and practices have changed over time. All findings are important learnings that roll into actionable recommendations that can inform the design of the evaluation of a potential MIDD renewal.  

# EVALUATION PLAN AND FRAMEWORK  

# Strengths  

The Plan provides flexibility to adjust measures as learning takes place over time, especially with respect to output measures and their targets.  

The Plan accommodates the diversity of strategies supported by MIDD funding.  

# Challenges  

The framework lacks detail and intermediate linkages that describe how MIDD strategies and programs bring about changes to reach MIDD policy goals. Interviewees have different expectations for the MIDD evaluation than what the MIDD Evaluation Plan articulates. Interviewees do not agree on the outputs and outcomes they would like to see included in MIDD evaluations. Interviewees expressed interest in understanding the level of community need that each MIDD strategy would meet.  

# Recommendations  

# R1. Clarify the purpose of the evaluation and logic of the evaluation framework.  

Create and include a defined and stated purpose and identify limitations on conclusions that can be drawn from the   
evaluation.   
Include a logic model that identifies proximal outcomes for each program or strategy and describes how impacting these outcomes affect distal outcomes.  

# R2. Involve stakeholders in developing the evaluation framework.  

# OUTPUTANDOUTCOMEMEASURES  

# Strengths  

The MIDD evaluation plan includes an evaluation matrix that lists, for each MIDD strategy, output and outcome measures.  

# Challenges  

No or too few proximal outcomes are measured for many MIDD strategies; evaluation best practice notes that both distal and proximal outcomes are important to understanding the impact of each MIDD strategy. Interviewees stated that measures should be clinically relevant, including behavioral health symptoms, daily function, and quality of life. The detail and specificity of output measures in the  

# Recommendations  

# R3. Establish relevant output and outcome measures.  

Establish output and outcome measures across the entire logic chain – from services provided to goals. Measures should be relevant to participants and providers and be useful to monitor implementation and improvements.  

# R4. When available, select valid, reliable, and sensitive proximal outcome measures in collaboration with service providers.

# INTRODUCTION  

In 2005, the Washington State Legislature authorized counties to implement a one-tenth of one percent sales tax for mental health and chemical dependency treatment and therapeutic court programs and services. In King County, this tax is known as the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) sales tax. In 2015, MIDD sales tax revenues totaled nearly $\$60$ million and served more than 23,000 individuals.  

MIDD-funded programs are intended “to prevent and reduce chronic homelessness and unnecessary involvement in the criminal justice and emergency medical systems and promote recovery for persons with disabling mental illness and chemical dependency by implementing a full continuum of treatment, housing and case management services.”1  

Ordinance 15949 defines five policy goals (see Appendix C) and requires that the King County Department of Community and Human Services (DCHS) conduct evaluations that describe how MIDD funding is spent and report on a set of required output2 and outcome3 measures. To fulfill these requirements, the System Performance Evaluation Group in the King County Department of Community and Human Services, Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division4 conducts evaluations according to the MIDD Evaluation Plan. The MIDD Evaluation Plan was adopted by the Metropolitan King County Council (the Council) via Ordinance 16262 in 2008.  

The intent of the MIDD evaluation efforts was to “examine the impact of all strategies to demonstrate effectiveness of MIDD funds and to assess whether the MIDD goals are being achieved, on both individual and system levels”5and to provide transparency to decision makers, stakeholders and the public on how MIDD dollars were being spent.  

# Purpose of this MIDD Evaluation Assessment  

The 2007 MIDD sales tax legislation includes a sunset date of December 31, 2016, ending the authority of King County to collect the tax. King County and community partners are in the process of identifying future MIDD activities, if the tax is renewed by the Council.  

In planning for the potential renewal of MIDD, the Council adopted Ordinance 17998 in March 2015 requiring a comprehensive review and assessment of the MIDD sales tax that was collected from 2008- 2016, including “… proposed recommendations on improvements to MIDD performance measures, evaluation data gathering, including a review of the evaluation processes, timeframes, and data gathering.”  

This report is an assessment of the MIDD evaluations conducted from 2008 to 2015. It is designed to address certain requirements of Ordinance 17998, specifically:  

The extent to which the 2008 MIDD Evaluation Plan was used to guide evaluation activities; Strengths and challenges of the 2008-2015 MIDD evaluation activities that were conducted, according to those interviewed and evaluation best practices, including data collection processes, measures, analysis methodology, and reporting; and   
Opportunities to strengthen future MIDD evaluations.  

# MIDD Evaluation Assessment Methodology  

The King County Department of Community and Human Services engaged the King County Office of Performance, Strategy and Budget (PSB) to conduct the independent evaluation assessment.  The results of this work comprise the body of this report.  

The methodology used for the assessment, which was conducted from November 2015 through February 2016, included three approaches:  

Review of Evaluation Documents. PSB staff gathered and reviewed historical MIDD evaluation information, including the MIDD Evaluation Plan and the 2008 – 2015 MIDD progress and annual reports. PSB staff compared the Evaluation Plan with the MIDD progress and annual reports to determine to what extent the Plan was implemented. PSB staff also assessed the evaluation methodology, drawing on evaluation literature, key informant interviews, and expertise in evaluation methodology and performance measurement.  

Current Practice Review. PSB staff reviewed practices used by counties similar in size to King County for the evaluation of behavioral health care programs and reviewed innovative approaches to the evaluation of behavioral health care.  

Stakeholder Interviews. PSB staff interviewed 30 people, including MIDD Oversight Committee members and designees, MIDD service providers, staff from the King County Executive Office, King County Council, King County Department of Community and Human Services, King County Information Technology and external subject matter experts. The list of interviewees is provided in Appendix A, and the list of interview questions is provided in Appendix B. Due to the qualitative nature of the interviews and the purposive selection of stakeholders interviewed, this document does not quantify interview results. For instance, reporting the percent of interviewees who mentioned a particular topic during the conversation would convey specificity that is not warranted based on the methodology used.  

# BACKGROUND FOR MIDD EVALUATION ASSESSMENT  

The purpose of this section is to provide background and context for the themes and recommendations of this MIDD evaluation assessment. The section addresses the purpose and key concepts used in health and human service evaluations. It also provides a summary of current practices in behavioral health care evaluations, after briefly describing MIDD implementation and programming.  

# MIDD Implementation Structure  

In 2007, the Council voted to enact a MIDD sales tax to support new or expanded mental illness and chemical dependency and therapeutic court programs and services. This vote adopted Ordinance 15949, in which the Council authorized the collection of the sales tax and established major policy goals to guide the development of the MIDD implementation. MIDD implementation is organized around five  

service areas which are subdivided into 37 different strategies. Each strategy is implemented through one or more programs that provide services for clients. Services are delivered either through Countybased programs or through community-based programs contracted by the County. The following graphic illustrates the multi-layered structure of the MIDD as implemented.  

![](images/a7bc9164b19f0e3da542eb4c969a91ae0aed07149f039fdece398c9f49b87abb.jpg)  

This report of the MIDD evaluation assessment focuses on the MIDD Evaluation Plan, adopted by Council via Ordinance 16262 in October 2008, which describes the evaluation and reporting plans for the strategies funded with the MIDD sales tax.  

# Purpose of Evaluations  

Program6 evaluation has become standard practice in health and human services over the past 40 years7 to help managers and policymakers determine whether to continue, improve, expand or curtail a program; to increase the effectiveness of program management and administration; to assess the utility of new programs; and to address the accountability requirements of program sponsors.8  

Program evaluation is “defined as a social science activity directed at collection, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating information about the workings and effectiveness of social programs.” 9 Typically, program evaluation involves assessing one or more of the following: “(1) the need for the program, (2) the design of the program, (3) program implementation and service delivery, (4) program impact or outcomes, and (5) program efficiency.” 10  

Ordinance 15949 required the development of a MIDD evaluation plan with a focus on two of these five evaluation domains: (3) program implementation and service delivery and (4) program impact. The key evaluation concepts described in the next section describe concepts that are relevant for these two domains of program evaluation and represent best practices in program evaluation.11  

# Key Program Evaluation Concepts  

The ultimate goal of health and human service programs is to bring about change by affecting a problem in beneficial ways. The changed or improved conditions are the intended outcomes or products of the programs. A program’s intended outcomes are identified in the program evaluation framework. The framework articulates the “outcomes of social programs as part of a logic model that connects the program’s activities to proximal (immediate) outcomes that, in turn, are expected to lead to other, more distal outcomes. If correctly described, this series of linked relationships among outcomes represents the program’s assumptions about the critical steps between program services and the ultimate social benefits the program is intended to produce.“12 Program evaluation terms used throughout this report are defined in the Evaluation Term Glossary below.  

# Evaluation Term Glossary  

Causal Relationship: A causal relationship between two events exists if the occurrence of the first causes the other.  

Proximal Outcome: An outcome a program can impact directly, for example, the severity of mental health symptoms among participants of programs that provide mental health services.  

Distal Outcome: An outcome that is distant from program activities but the ultimate outcome of interest, such as the MIDD policy goals articulated in Ordinance 15949. Because distal outcomes are more removed from program activities than proximal outcomes, the former tend to be impacted by many factors outside of a program’s control. A program, therefore, has less direct influence on distal than proximal outcomes.  

Effectiveness: Effectiveness addresses how well a program achieves its stated goals and objectives.  

Measure: A measure is a value, characteristic, or metric used to track the performance of a program.  

Outcome Measure: A measure that describes the state of the population or social condition a program is expected to have changed.  

Output Measure: A measure of the product or service produced through a program.  

Target: A desired number or level for an output or outcome measure. Targets are the objectives an organization is striving to reach.  

The definitions are based on:  

Kinney AS, Mucha MJ, eds. (2010). State and Local Government Performance Management: Sourcebook. Chicago, IL: Government Finance Officers Association   
Rossi PH, Freeman HE, Lipsey MW (2004). Evaluation: A Systematic Approach, $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ Edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2011). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Office of the Director, Office of Strategy and Innovation. Introduction to Program Evaluation for Public Health Programs: A Self-study Guide. Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  

Best practices indicate that the strongest evaluation frameworks are developed during, and help inform, program design. Considering the relationships between a desired outcome and the multiple pathways to achieve the outcome provides the opportunity to consider individual, organizational and system factors that contribute to improving the outcome.  

Approaches used for developing an evaluation framework based on best practices include:  

Identifying program activities performed and then linking activities with desired outcomes.13 Identifying a desired outcome and then designing program activities that are assumed to best achieve the outcome based on existing research and emerging and innovative program design.14 Describing the relationship between inputs (resources and staff), program activities, outputs (how much of an activity was delivered) and desired outcomes in a logic model.15  

Describing causal relationships between program activities and desired distal outcomes can be challenging for any evaluation framework in health and human services, due to the numerous and complex factors that contribute to individuals’ mental and physical health, substance use and other behaviors. Because $^{\prime\prime}a$ given set of outcomes can be produced by factors other than program processes”16,  for health and human services evaluations interested in demonstrating impact, it is therefore particularly important to be grounded in a detailed evaluation framework that links program activities to proximal and distal outcomes.  

# Current Practice Review of Behavioral Health Care Evaluations  

The purpose of this section is to describe current practices being used to evaluate behavioral health care.  

# Behavioral health care quality measurement is an evolving practice  

To support access to safe, effective and affordable behavioral health care for all Americans, the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) started to develop the National Behavioral Health Quality Framework (NBHQF) in 2011, that is, after the 2008 adoption of the MIDD Evaluation Plan.17 The NBHQF framework is intended to guide the “identification and implementation of key behavioral health care quality measures for use in agency or system funding decisions, monitoring behavioral health of the nation, and the delivery of behavioral health care.”  

In designing the framework, SAMHSA recognized that in the field of behavioral health care quality measurement, at this time, “relatively few acceptable outcome measures exist that are endorsed by $N Q{\cal F}^{18}$ or other relevant national entities.” SAMHSA noted that behavioral health care quality measurement is a relatively young field and that many measures have yet to be defined and validated, but that significant growth in outcome measures can be expected in the next few years.  

SAMHSA, nevertheless, recently proposed a set of core measures for use in a variety of settings and programs, including evaluation efforts. In addition, SAMHSA encouraged utilizing these measures, as appropriate, to have a consistent set of indicators of quality in behavioral health prevention, promotion, treatment, and recovery support efforts across the U.S.  

# National call for measurement-based care in the delivery of behavioral health services  

To advance the quality of behavioral health care in the United States, the Kennedy Forum19 recently endorsed the use of measurement-based care. “All primary care and behavioral health providers treating mental health and substance use disorders should implement a system of measurement-based care whereby validated symptom rating scales are completed by patients and reviewed by clinicians during encounters. Measurement-based care will help providers determine whether the treatment is working and facilitate treatment adjustments, consultations, or referrals for higher intensity services when patients are not improving as expected.”  

The Washington State Mental Health Integration Program (MHIP)20 is one example of a measurementbased mental health care approach that has been implemented locally. The program, which started in January 2008, now includes almost 200 community health and mental health centers across Washington, with funding from Washington State, King County and Community Health Plan of Washington. MHIP uses a patient registry to track and measure patient goals and clinical outcomes. The approach combines the provision of mental health care with concurrent evaluation of patient response to inform providers, who may adjust care if a patient is not improving as expected. In addition, provider payment is tied to quality of care indicators.  

As indicated, such an approach is not commonly applied. This is due in part to the fact that measurement-based behavioral health care is not common practice in the U.S., despite having been proposed as long as twenty years ago.21 Organizations with integrated physical and behavioral health care may be more open to a measurement-based focus than community mental health and chemical dependency providers for whom measurement-based care has not been widely applied. That said, MHIP does provide a measurement-based care approach for consideration.  

# Evaluation practices used by other counties focus on output measures  

While MIDD includes a focus on justice system diversion efforts22, several counties implemented behavioral health care programs to improve the mental health of the overall population in their jurisdiction. A sampling of jurisdictions comparable to King County in population size (see Figure 1) indicates that behavioral health care evaluations typically report on output measures, such as the number of patient visits or patients in care.  

In Dallas County, the North Texas Behavioral Health Authority publishes a Collaborative Report that includes output measures such as patients served, complaints and appeals, utilization, and provider network activity.24 The report also publishes financial data, such as cost per person and acute costs relative to overall costs. Additional reports provide customer satisfaction results and a needs assessment.  

Figure 1: Jurisdictions included in comparative analysis

The San Francisco County approach, similar to the North Texas Behavioral Health Authority, is to document customer satisfaction in addition to other output and outcome measures, including reduction in individuals’ drug use.25  

San Bernardino and Santa Clara Counties in California report by programs focusing on budgets and capacity, claim payments, access to care and timeliness of care.26 Cuyahoga County and Allegheny County also provide finance data, though Cuyahoga County’s CountyStat, in addition, includes output measures such as the number of available beds in treatment facilities and the number of individuals receiving treatment.27  

Hennepin County in Minnesota reports results from the Survey of the Health of All the Population and the Environment (SHAPE), which periodically inquires about the health of county residents. When last released in 2010, SHAPE provided information on the county’s overall health, including mental health concerning depression and anxiety.28  

# MIDD EVALUATION ASSESSMENT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  

This MIDD evaluation assessment report focuses on the MIDD Evaluation Plan adopted by Council via Ordinance 16262 in October 2008. The adopted plan outlines the evaluation and reporting plan for the strategies funded with the MIDD sales tax, including a proposed schedule for evaluations; output and outcome measures and measure targets (the “evaluation matrix”); and data elements to be used for reporting and evaluations. The Plan consists of three components:  

1. System Process Evaluation to describe how the implementation of MIDD is progressing.  

2. Strategy Process Evaluation to assess what was done.  

3. Outcome Evaluation to assess the effect of MIDD strategies on MIDD policy goals and other expected results.  

The results of the evaluation work are published twice a year in an Annual Report that summarizes the findings of the most recent October-September time period and a mid-year Progress Report that summarizes the findings of the most recent October-March time period. The reporting periods for MIDD were established in 2008 in Ordinance 16262.29  

This section describes strengths and challenges of the MIDD Evaluation Plan as implemented. These findings and recommendations are based on the opinions of the interviewees, document reviews, and best practices review conducted for this assessment. The chapter is organized into five topical parts. Each part presents analytic findings, followed by recommendations to address identified challenges.  

# MIDD Evaluation Plan and Evaluation Framework  

The 2008 MIDD Evaluation Plan describes an approach to evaluate (1) strategy implementation and (2) strategy impact. For these two domains of evaluation, the Plan is comprehensive, oriented toward learning and improvement and focused on accountability to achieve desired outputs and outcomes. Multiple strengths of the Plan were evident during this assessment:  

The Plan provides flexibility to adjust measures as learning takes place over time, especially with respect to output measures and their targets. As strategies are implemented and better understood, evaluation may require new or updated measures and targets.30 For instance, if a strategy can serve more clients than originally anticipated, the target for its output measure may be increased. In contrast, if a data source does not materialize as anticipated, data may not be available to collect and analyze planned output and outcome measures.  

The MIDD Evaluation Plan includes a process to make amendments, which benefits the evaluation by keeping it relevant to decision makers and stakeholders over time.  

The Plan accommodates the diversity of strategies supported by MIDD funding. MIDD funds dozens of strategies, ranging from increasing the number of trainings and licensed behavioral health care providers, to improving school-based suicide prevention, to providing direct services to people in crisis.  

The MIDD Evaluation Plan accommodates this variety by identifying strategy-specific output and outcome measures, which sets up an evaluation that can provide meaningful, relevant measures for each strategy.  

This assessment also identified challenges associated with how the Evaluation Plan was implemented and communicated. Challenges include:  

The MIDD logic model lacks detail in describing how MIDD strategies are expected to bring about changes to reach MIDD policy goals. Evaluation best practice recommends that logic models describe in detail how MIDD strategies are expected to influence both proximal and distal outcomes based on evidence.31 Interviewees and a review of evaluation reports found that while the current MIDD evaluation framework has logic chains between measures for some strategies, it does not have enough proximal outcomes and clear logical linkages to the distal outcomes (or policy goals) to support audience understanding of how MIDD strategies are influencing MIDD policy goals.32 In addition, interviewees noted that, in their opinion, it is not possible for MIDD-funded providers to influence the MIDD policy goals directly.  

Interviewees have different expectations for the MIDD evaluation than what the MIDD Evaluation Plan articulates. The Evaluation Plan fulfills the requirements of legislation as described in Ordinances 15949 and 16262. However, interviewees have different opinions on the usefulness of the MIDD evaluation, as executed, because it does not meet all of their expected purposes. Expectations for how the evaluation could be used include: monitoring program implementation, supporting continuous improvement, informing MIDD funding decisions, and demonstrating impact at the participant, provider, program, strategy, or community level. Interviewees also identified multiple potential audiences for the evaluation, such as: the community, MIDD providers, King County staff managing MIDD funding, King County Council, and the King County Executive Office.  

When evaluation intent and stakeholder expectations do not match, the usefulness of an evaluation is limited because some users of the results will not be able to meet their desired purpose.  

Interviewees do not agree on the outputs and outcomes they would like to see included in MIDD evaluations. This assessment included interviews with MIDD Oversight Committee members/designees, MIDD service providers, King County Executive Office staff, Department of Community and Human Services staff and behavioral health and program evaluation subject matter experts. Among interviewees, there was no consistent response about which of the current measures are useful and what new measures would be desirable. Similar to the finding above, this inconsistency in expectations results in dissatisfaction with the evaluation, as currently implemented, among some users of the results.  

Interviewees expressed interest in understanding the level of community need that each MIDD strategy would meet. This observation is not a challenge of the current MIDD evaluation, but provides information for future evaluation design discussions. It highlights a disconnect between what the current evaluation was designed to do and how stakeholders desire to use the evaluation results.  

Interviewees expressed that they would like to better understand how much need there is in the community for each type of service, how different MIDD strategies contribute to meeting that need, and the unmet need that remains. If decision makers want to address these questions in the design of the new MIDD evaluation, conducting a needs assessment is a common practice in health and human service program design.33 A “needs assessment” is an analysis to determine the number of individuals who would benefit from services and ways in which their needs can be met. A needs assessment grounds a program in an understanding of the current state; provides baseline data for quantifying the impact of a program on meeting community needs; and, when used in evaluation, provides context for output and outcome measures and demonstrates the potential of the program in relation to the community as a whole.  

There are multiple challenges inherent in conducting a needs assessment that should be considered as well, including the cost of conducting an assessment, availability of information to support a rigorous assessment, developing agreed-upon definitions of “need” and “unmet need” across multiple areas, and an agreed upon framework for how to use assessment results in decision making.  

# Recommendations  

To address the challenges related to the Evaluation Plan and framework identified above, the MIDD II evaluation design should:  

# R1. Clarify the purpose of the evaluation and logic of the evaluation framework.  

The evaluation plan for MIDD II, and its accompanying evaluation framework, should have a clearly defined and stated purpose. This purpose should describe what the evaluation is intended to inform, who will be informed by the results, and how the results can and should be used by the intended audience. It should also clarify any caveats or limitations about conclusions that should not be drawn from the evaluation, based on its design.  

The evaluation framework should describe how MIDD-funded activities are expected to influence MIDD participant outcomes and how participant outcomes link to system- and community-based outcomes and policy goals. The framework should include a logic model that identifies proximal outcomes for each strategy34 and describes how impacting these outcomes affects distal outcomes. In addition, factors that influence policy goals aside from MIDD-funded activities should be described. Once these logical linkages are made, a strategy can be evaluated on its ability to generate the proximal and distal outcomes.  

# R2. Involve stakeholders in developing the evaluation framework.  

Any future evaluation framework would benefit from more involvement of community stakeholders, King County MIDD staff, program providers, and the evaluation team in developing its purpose, the logic chain that connects MIDD strategies to policy goals, and identifying measures for outputs and proximal and distal outcomes.35  

Involving community stakeholders, King County MIDD staff and program providers in developing the evaluation framework with the evaluation team will help build agreement regarding desired results and values and beliefs about change processes and their underlying assumptions. Working in partnership may help address resistance to data collection and reporting by selecting measures that are relevant to stakeholders and program providers and thus enhance the use of evaluation results to further policy goals. Evaluation best practice suggests this approach to make the evaluation more relevant to those implementing programs and to help avoid future issues around conflicting expectations.  

# MIDD Evaluation Output and Outcome Measures  

The MIDD evaluation plan includes an evaluation matrix that lists, for each MIDD strategy, output and outcome measures. The goal of the output measurement was to assess what was done with MIDD money. The goal of the outcome measurement was to assess the effect of MIDD strategies on MIDD policy goals and other expected results. MIDD document reviews and interviews identified the following challenges related to the output and outcome measures selected for the MIDD evaluation:  

No or too few proximal outcomes are measured for many MIDD strategies. As described on page 9, evaluation best practice notes that both distal and proximal outcomes are important for understanding the impact of a MIDD strategy. The evaluation matrix in the Evaluation Plan lists output and outcome measures by MIDD strategies. In this matrix and in subsequent updates to the matrix published in MIDD progress and annual reports, MIDD strategies are linked with output measures, proximal outcome measures and measures of policy goals (the distal outcomes) for some strategies. For the remaining strategies, however, either no or too few proximal outcomes are included to be able to assess whether MIDD strategies influence the MIDD policy goals or to support MIDD continuous improvement efforts.  

For example, to gauge whether spending money for Strategy 1a-1 (Increase access to mental health outpatient services) reduces the number of jail bookings, the MIDD evaluation matrix links:  

o people who received services (measured output) to:  

changes in symptom severity (measured proximal outcome), which is assumed to: improve daily functioning (not measured) and reduce behaviors (not measured) that result in: o a jail booking (measured distal outcome) or emergency room visit (measured distal outcome).  

In this case, some links between MIDD strategies, output and proximal outcome measures and policy goals are assumed instead of measured, which is not sufficient to be able to attribute attaining MIDD policy goals to Strategy 1a-1.  

In addition, the evaluation does not measure proximal outcomes for strategies that use evidencebased approaches, such as Strategy 1c: Emergency Room Substance Abuse and Early Intervention Program. For such strategies, the evaluation instead measures the number of clients served (output) and jail and ER use (distal outcomes). The Evaluation Plan notes that for MIDD strategies based on evidence-based practices there is no need to demonstrate a causal relationship between MIDD funding and MIDD policy goals. While this approach sounds efficient, it does not support continuous improvement efforts, which interviewees noted as one desired purpose of the evaluation. Continuous improvement efforts require information on whether MIDD activities have the intended immediate impact on program participants so that adjustments can be made, if necessary. Moreover, evidence-based practices can only be expected to support MIDD policy goals if the practices have been shown to impact the type of goals specified for MIDD.  The MIDD evaluation plan and the MIDD progress and annual reports do not note which evidence-based practices supported by MIDD have been proven to impact such policy goals as the ones adopted for MIDD.  

Interviewees stated that, for providers of behavioral health treatment, measures should be clinically relevant, including measures of behavioral health symptoms, daily function and quality of life. Behavioral health symptoms are measured for some MIDD strategies in the current evaluation. However, interviewees perceived that, in an effort to avoid additional data collection burden, some measures were chosen because providers collected the data already, not because the measures are necessarily well-suited for behavioral health screening and treatment monitoring. Therefore, the selected measures may not be useful in determining the effectiveness of strategies funded by MIDD.  

In particular, the symptom and function measures that are used for the MIDD evaluation include the PHQ-9 (for depression), the GAD7 (for anxiety), the Problem Severity Summary (PSS), and the Children’s Functional Assessment Rating Scale (CFARS). The first two measures (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) have been thoroughly validated36 and recommended by the Center for Integrated Health Solutions (CIHS) 37 and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality $(A H R Q)^{38}$ . However, there is limited (PSS) or no validation (CFARS) in the behavioral health research literature for the other two measures and neither is included in the list of measures kept by CIHS and AHRQ. CFARS was selected based on a 2009 review of mental health measures for children and adolescents conducted by staff from the Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division (MHCADSD). The  

measure selection process considered data collection burden for clients, providers and MHCADSD staff, cost, and measure properties such as validity, reliability, and sensitivity. The PSS was selected after a 2009 survey of King County mental health providers revealed that no outcome measure was employed by a majority of survey respondents. About half of the respondents reported using the PSS, which had been utilized countywide in the past. The PSS was developed locally for an adult community and mental health population, is available free of charge and relatively brief, which reduces data collection burden. When the decision was made to include the PSS in the MIDD outcome measures, it was noted that the measure does not have a strong recovery orientation and that it is reported by clinicians, not the individuals who receive services.  

The detail and specificity of output measures in the Evaluation Matrix vary by strategy. While most output measures in the evaluation focus on ongoing service provision, some strategies include output measures only for program start-up activities. For example, Strategy 1f includes a measure of “Employ a 1.0 FTE parent partner specialist.” In contrast, Strategy 16a includes the ongoing measures “Number of residential units created” and “Number of rental subsidies dispersed.” Further, it is not clear why measure types and details vary across strategies, nor why some measures are categorized as output instead of outcome measures. Having consistency across strategies in selecting measures for start-up versus ongoing activities and in categorizing output versus outcome measures improves the clarity and purpose of the evaluation and enhances transparency and accountability.  

# Recommendations  

To address the challenges related to output and outcome measures identified above, the MIDD II evaluation design should:  

# R3. Establish relevant output and outcome measures.  

To have an evaluation that supports learning and continuous improvement, output and outcome measures must be relevant to participants and program providers and be useful to monitor implementation and improvements.  

In addition, future MIDD evaluations may benefit from measures that communicate and monitor program quality and benefits from the clients’ perspective. The Institute of Medicine Committee on Crossing the Quality Chasm strongly recommends a focus on behavioral health care that is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable.39 The current practice review shows that measures of the quality of service – such as client complaints and client satisfaction – are used by other jurisdictions. For instance, the North Texas Behavioral Health Authority employs the following client satisfaction measures as one way to monitor and improve the quality of its services:  

How satisfied are you with being treated with respect by staff at this clinic? How satisfied are you about your ability to improve your own life? Overall, how satisfied are you with the mental health services of your clinic?  

These and other questions may ensure that clients are receiving care that is respectful and meets their needs. In some cases, particularly where MIDD is only a portion of the total funding of a program that might be evaluated by other funders, these types of measures may already be tracked and the evaluation design should take care to not duplicate efforts.  

# R4. When available, select valid, reliable, and sensitive proximal outcome measures in collaboration with service providers.  

Applying best practices, the MIDD evaluation should select measures that have been demonstrated to be reliable, sensitive, and valid.40 In addition, providers should be involved when proximal outcome measures are selected for the services they provide. Providers are more likely to support evaluation efforts when they see value in the data they have to collect for the evaluation. For example, validated symptom rating scales could be administered to MIDD participants during MIDD-funded contacts with behavioral health care providers.  

“Symptom rating scales (also known as patient-reported outcome measures) are brief structured instruments that patients use to report their perceptions about the frequency and/or severity of the psychiatric symptoms they are experiencing (…) These symptom rating scales (e.g., PHQ-9 for depression) are practical to administer, interpretable, reliable, and sensitive to changes in the frequency/severity of psychiatric symptoms and functional impairment over time. (….) With clinical judgement alone, behavioral health providers frequently fail to detect a lack of improvement or a worsening of symptoms in their patients, and this can lead to clinical inertia (i.e., not changing the treatment plan even though the patient is not benefiting from the current treatment).  

Without the systematic monitoring of symptoms, providers miss opportunities to improve their treatments over time and clinical practices miss opportunities to evaluate quality improvement activities. In addition, when aggregated across all patients in a clinical practice or healthcare system, symptom rating scales data can be used to demonstrate the value of behavioral health services to payers.” 41  

Currently, MIDD funds often pay only for a subset of individuals who receive services that are included in the MIDD strategies. It would be challenging to introduce new outcome measures only for this subset of individuals. Thus, future MIDD evaluation designs need to weigh the cost to providers and the County of introducing new outcome measures versus the benefit of having valid, reliable, and sensitive measures.  

# R5. Focus on clinically and practically meaningful changes in outcomes.  

A statistically significant difference from zero does not necessarily imply that there was a meaningful change in an outcome, or that patients noticed a difference in their daily lives. Thus, instead of assessing whether there was any change, future MIDD evaluations may want to  

measure the extent of clinically or practically meaningful changes. For instance, the PHQ-9 distinguishes depression levels ranging from no to severe depression. Knowing that depression symptoms changed from severe to mild after a person participated in MIDD would be more meaningful than knowing that there was any change in their symptoms, because any change may not be enough to make a difference in the person’s life. An example of this suggestion can be found in the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Fifth Annual Report, which notes that “of the 613 [people] with severe or extremely severe anxiety symptoms during their pre period, 161 $(26\%)$ showed only slight or no impairment in at least one follow-up measure” (p. 60).  

# MIDD Evaluation Process  

The MIDD evaluation is conducted by the System Performance Evaluation (SPE) section within the Behavioral Health and Recovery Division of DCHS. The SPE team is responsible for reviewing output and outcome data collected and submitted to the county by MIDD-funded providers; cleaning and consolidating the data; and conducting data analyses that are the foundation for the evaluation reports. SPE staff also write the MIDD evaluation progress and annual reports and provide data and analysis results in response to ad-hoc inquiries. The team works closely with providers and BHRD MIDD program staff throughout the year to review output targets and needs for adjustment.  

Strengths of the current evaluation process include:  

The data acquisition process supports providers who have different levels of data collection and sharing capabilities. The evaluation team uses data submitted to King County by providers, generally on a monthly basis. The data track providers’ status toward meeting output goals specified in their contracts with the County. Interviewees highlighted that the decision to accept data in multiple formats, even formats that are inconsistent with King County data standards, allows providers who have limited expertise and/or infrastructure for collecting and sharing data to participate in MIDD. This flexibility increases the pool of providers who may participate in MIDD, which supports King County equity and social justice goals.   
MIDD includes dedicated resources for data cleaning, merging and analysis. Interviewees noted that, due to the flexibility of submitting data in varying formats, MIDD’s dedicated resources for data cleaning, merging, and analysis are necessary to meeting evaluation timelines because the resources make it possible to manage multiple data formats in a timely way.  

This assessment also identified challenges with the evaluation process, including:  

Data are provided in varying formats, which means King County staff spend significant time preparing data for analysis. Because providers submit data in multiple formats, including formats that are prone to formatting errors (e.g., Microsoft Excel), the evaluation team performs considerable data cleaning and merging activities before they can analyze the data. As long as providers continue to submit data in spreadsheets, manual cleaning by King County staff will be necessary, despite the evaluation team’s use of computer programs to check for data errors electronically after they obtain data from providers. Feared loss of funding creates a disincentive for reporting on, understanding, and learning from lower than anticipated performance on output and outcome measures. Interviewees reported tha the MIDD evaluation does not foster a continuous learning environment where strategies and/or programs are adjusted or modified based on data and outcomes. Some interviewees suggested that this may be due to concerns about losing funding in case of unfavorable evaluation results. However, in our assessment of MIDD evaluation and reporting, we did not find any instances of  

strategies or programs losing funding due to performance issues. Funding declined due to the decline in sales tax revenue caused by the Great Recession, which began shortly after MIDD implementation started. Less tax revenue resulted in MIDD cuts, which some believed were influenced by evaluation results.  

# Recommendation  

To address the challenges related to the evaluation process identified above, the MIDD II evaluation should:  

# R6. Invest in data collection infrastructure.  

As noted, data collection, sharing, and cleaning consume considerable time, both for providers and the King County evaluation team. Future evaluations will benefit from efforts to reduce manual data collection and sharing, including offering resources for technical assistance with data reporting and/or development of data reporting systems to providers who have limited capacity for data collection and sharing; involving evaluation staff and provider staff responsible for data collection and sharing in contract negotiations to set realistic expectations before MIDD funds are distributed; reviewing data quality on an on-going basis and providing timely feed-back to providers; leveraging data requirements for the County’s Behavioral Health Integration IT project, in particular the electronic medical records requirement; and continuing to provide dedicated resources for data collection and sharing.  

Implementing this recommendation may increase administrative and infrastructure costs for MIDD II, but investing in data infrastructure may increase the capacity to use data for learning and improvement and reduce the use of staff time for data management.  

# MIDD Outcome Evaluation  

As stated earlier in this report, the MIDD outcome evaluation is focused on whether MIDD-funded strategies achieve expected outcomes as outlined in the Evaluation Plan. Strengths of the MIDD outcome evaluation, as highlighted by this assessment, include:  

MIDD progress and annual reports provide detailed information on the vast majority of outcome measures listed in the MIDD Evaluation Matrix.42 PSB’s review of the Evaluation Plan and all subsequent annual and progress reports showed that the Evaluation Plan was closely followed during implementation and that information on most outcome measures is available in the evaluation reports.  

Where possible, the information presented in MIDD reports is based on data collected from individuals before and after they started MIDD-funded services and, thus, captures changes that occurred while MIDD was in place. This approach answers to what extent there were changes in outcomes and outputs for individuals served by MIDD.  

However, as readers of the MIDD progress and annual reports are reminded, observed changes in outcomes are not necessarily due to MIDD funding alone, as modifications in policing or sentencing practices, psychiatric hospital capacity, housing supply, or other factors in a person’s life also can make a difference.  

Additional observations about the outcome evaluation include:  

The evaluation methodology used is not suitable to assess the causal impact of MIDD strategies on outcomes, including MIDD policy goals. There are usually many factors that influence desired outcomes, many of which are outside the control of the MIDD strategies. As noted, it is, therefore, not appropriate to attribute observed changes in outcome measures only to MIDD strategies.  

Randomized field experiments are the strongest research design for assessing the impact of an intervention because they provide unbiased estimates of intervention effects.43 Appendix F lists examples of social service projects administered in non-research settings that use randomized comparison groups to measure impact. When a randomized field experiment is not feasible due to ethical concerns, cost considerations, or other challenges, nonrandomized quasi-experimental designs44 are often used instead. Nonrandomized quasi-experimental designs include constructed control groups, equating groups using statistical techniques, regression-discontinuity designs and the comparison of participants with themselves.45  

The MIDD outcome evaluation relies mostly on what is called a simple pre-post reflexive design, which involves comparing outcomes measured for the same individuals before and after receiving services through MIDD (e.g., jail utilization in the year prior to starting MIDD compared to jail utilization during the year after participating in MIDD). This design was approved by the King County Council and the MIDD Oversight Committee. While all quasi-experimental designs may provide biased estimates “simple pre-post reflexive designs provide biased estimates of program effects that have little value for purposes of impact assessment”.46  Therefore, the results of the MIDD evaluations cannot be used to claim or imply causality.  

King County considered other types of comparisons during the MIDD, including:  

o Ordinance 16262 directed the MIDD Oversight Committee to review and study the concept of establishing a historical comparison group and make a recommendation. The Historical Control Group workgroup recognized that a historical comparison group would not be appropriate to determine to what extent MIDD caused changes in the outcomes of interest. Accordingly, the MIDD Oversight Committee did not recommend using such a comparison group for the MIDD evaluation.   
o The MIDD evaluation team attempted to use a concurrent comparison group design to assess whether changes in the criminal justice system, rather than MIDD strategies alone, contributed  

to the reduction in jail days reported for MIDD participants.47 It is unclear from the MIDD report whether the comparison group meets the requirements for a valid concurrent comparison group. The information in the report suggests, however, that the MIDD group was not typical of other jail users and that the comparison group, thus, is not likely to be valid. The difficulty (or impossibility) of identifying a suitable concurrent comparison group for MIDD participants may have led to the decision to forego additional analyses based on a concurrent comparison group design.  

# Recommendation  

To address the challenges related to the outcome evaluation identified above, the MIDD II evaluation design should:  

# R7. Modify evaluation design if the next MIDD evaluation is to show causality.  

If future evaluations are expected to establish whether MIDD-funded activities caused changes in outcomes, an evaluation design needs to be employed that can achieve this goal.  

Random assignment is the gold standard for determining whether an intervention is the reason for observed changes. As noted earlier, random assignment may not be feasible when an intervention is implemented outside of a research setting due to ethical concerns, cost considerations, or implementation challenges.48  

An alternative approach to random assignment is a concurrent comparison group design. An example of a recent evaluation that used this approach is the New York City ABLE Project of Incarcerated Youth.49 The design requires determining: (a) characteristics that influence the outcome of interest (e.g., severity of crime: individuals who commit more serious crimes spend more days in jail); and (b) characteristics that influence whether a person participates in a program (e.g., readiness to change: individuals motivated to reduce their criminal behavior are more likely to participate in MIDD-funded programs). Next, one needs to identify non-program participants who have the same characteristics as participants (e.g., individuals with the same motivation to reduce criminal behavior and who committed the same types of crimes as MIDD participants). It can be challenging to find the necessary data and individuals who meet these conditions.  

Given the challenges of implementing evaluation designs that are suitable to establish causality and the significant resources such designs may require, future MIDD evaluations may want to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of conducting assessments that demonstrate an impact on MIDD policy goals versus proximal outcomes. Because proximal outcomes are more directly linked to activities than are policy goals, factors outside a program’s control may be less likely to influence proximal outcomes, increasing the opportunity for establishing causality between MIDD activities and outcome measures.  

Policymakers and county leaders should determine whether the investment in conducting causal evaluations is necessary and know the limitations of any selected evaluation design in understanding cause and effect.  

# MIDD Evaluation Reporting  

The evaluation team prepares the evaluation reports, which are reviewed by MIDD strategy leads, DCHS leadership, and County executive leadership before publication. Strengths of the evaluation reports include:  

MIDD reports clearly describe to what extent strategies reached their output targets. As noted previously, the objective of the Strategy Process Evaluation is to measure progress towards meeting the output targets described in the MIDD evaluation matrix. The MIDD reports fulfill this objective by clearly reporting on output measures by strategy, which allows the reader to understand how much progress is being made toward output targets. MIDD reports describe how MIDD funding is spent. Interviewees stated that MIDD reports include useful information on how MIDD funding is being spent, such as the amount of money spent on individual MIDD strategies, and the outputs that each strategy is generating, such as the number of people served or the number of visits. Interviewees found the reports useful for demonstrating the level and impact of MIDD strategies to their respective organizations and to other potential funders. The reports are accessible and readable for multiple audiences and include an effective mix of quantitative analysis with qualitative anecdotes and information. These qualities were praised by interviewees, although interviewees also mentioned that the reports assume more background knowledge than readers may have. Interviewees also mentioned that they like the anecdotal success stories included in the report because it brings meaning to numbers.  Changes in the MIDD evaluation process are captured well in the evaluation reports. A review of MIDD progress and annual evaluation reports by PSB found that the reports describe when there are changes in the evaluation matrix and changes in output measure targets. It is important to document these changes to understand how the current evaluation process relates to the original Evaluation Plan.  

In addition, the assessment team identified challenges related to the evaluation reports, including:  

Results are not available at a frequency and time to inform funding decisions and continuous improvement efforts. Interviewees would like to use evaluation reports to inform funding decisions or continuous improvement activities. Although data are submitted at least monthly to the MIDD evaluation team and then analyzed and reported semi-annually, outcome results are not available for a year or longer, which is partially due to outcome data being collected infrequently (e.g., at baseline and 6 and 12 months post baseline). More frequent collection of outcome measures and more frequent and timely reporting would provide actionable information to MIDD decision makers and program managers. It is not clear why MIDD strategy process evaluation changes are made. Each MIDD strategy has output targets. These targets are sometimes adjusted by the MIDD evaluation team and reported in the MIDD annual and progress reports. While changes are noted, the rationale for the change is not consistently provided. Interviewees explained that strategy and data improvement activities are generally managed between County contract monitors and providers, and that this level of detail is not usually included in the MIDD annual and progress reports. This practice decreases the transparency of the evaluation and makes it difficult to learn from the experience of the strategy  

implementation. If the reason for changing the target represents learning and improvement, publishing the rationale and method for the adjustment would enhance future target setting.  

Evaluation report drafts are reviewed and edited by multiple stakeholders, which at times has introduced bias into reports. There was a perception among interviewees that County leadership, the MIDD Oversight Committee, and strategy owners may focus only on positive results in the MIDD reports. At times, this resulted in edits to the reports that included changed wording to imply a stronger link between MIDD funding and results than is supported by the analyses used to derive outcomes. These types of edits create the same issues as noted in the finding below, in that they can potentially mislead readers about the results of the evaluation.  

In some instances, the reports could be clearer in avoiding implications of a causal relationship between MIDD strategies and outcomes. MIDD reports include reminders that the evaluation design used for the outcome evaluation is not sufficient to determine whether MIDD was the reason for an observed change. However, in some cases, the reader may infer causation due to the way results are presented. For example, listing results in order of greatest change in outcome (see Figure 2) can be interpreted to mean that some MIDD strategies are more effective than others. Since this conclusion would be inappropriate, ranking and sorting of MIDD results by strategy can be misleading, unless the reader is reminded at this point that the evaluation design cannot establish causality.

# Recommendations  

To address the challenges related to the evaluation reporting identified above, the MIDD II design should:  

# R8. Increase frequency of performance evaluation availability.  

Evaluation results become available twice per year in the current MIDD evaluation process. To increase the evaluation’s ability to support timely decision-making and continuous improvement and understanding of what is and is not working, future evaluations should consider making  

output and outcome results available through a real-time or frequently-updated dashboard.50 This recommendation requires that outcome data are collected more frequently, which is consistent with a measurement-based approach to behavioral health care. If evaluation staff capacity is a constraint, the scope and frequency of formal reports could be reduced due to this increased availability and transparency of results.  

The dashboard content and format should be designed with the intended purpose of the evaluation and the intended audience clearly in mind, to best support decision making and strategy and/or program improvement.  

The value of an evaluation increases when its information is used to improve the services provided to improve desired outcomes.51 Increasing the shared expectations about how evaluation results will be used and aligning evaluation processes and the availability of evaluation results can increase accountability for using data to improve strategies and/or programs in a transparent way.  

# R9. Establish guidelines for report creators and editors on the scope of their decision making.  

Roles and responsibilities for developing and deciding upon the final content of the evaluation reports should be established. Reviewers and editors of the reports should clearly understand the scope of their editing role, and all edits should be reviewed by the person responsible for finalizing content before publishing information.  

In addition, decisions about which evaluation results to publish should be made before results are known, and significant results should be reported on, whether favorable or unfavorable. These changes will help maintain the objectivity of future MIDD evaluation reporting.  

# R10. Avoid presenting non-causal results in ways that imply causality.  

If an evaluation design suitable for causal inference is not feasible for future MIDD evaluations, the description of evaluation results needs to avoid the impression that MIDD is causally related to changes in outcomes. When results are presented in a way that may imply causality, at a minimum, the reader should be reminded that the evaluation design cannot establish causality.  

# CONCLUSION  

This assessment of the MIDD evaluations conducted from 2008-2015 found that there are many strengths to build upon. These evaluations provided information for stakeholders and the community to understand how MIDD funding was spent and the progress made toward the targets and goals identified in the MIDD Evaluation Plan. Additionally, this assessment identified some challenges and an evolution in behavioral health care evaluation that will need to be considered as the new evaluation plan is developed for potential MIDD renewal. It may be beneficial for the development of the next MIDD evaluation to build upon these learnings and consider the recommendations in this report.

# Appendix C: Additional Information on MIDD and its Evaluation Plan  

In 2007, the Council voted to enact a MIDD sales tax to support new or expanded mental illness and chemical dependency and therapeutic court programs and services. This vote adopted Ordinance 15949, in which the Council authorized the collection of the sales tax and established five policy goals to guide the development of the MIDD implementation:  

# Adopted MIDD Policy Goals Ordinance 15949  

1. A reduction of the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent using costly interventions like jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals;   
2. A reduction of the number of people who recycle through the jail, returning repeatedly as a result of their mental illness or chemical dependency;   
3. A reduction of the incidence and severity of chemical dependency and mental and emotional disorders in youth and adults;   
4. Diversion of mentally ill and chemically dependent youth and adults from initial or further justice system involvement; and   
5. Explicit linkage with, and furthering the work of, other Council directed efforts including, the Adult and Juvenile Justice Operational Master plans, the Plan to End Homelessness, the Veterans and Human Services Levy Services Improvement Plan and the King County Mental Health Recovery Plan.  

Ordinance 15949 also called for the development of three separate plans to be completed prior to the release of MIDD funds:  

Oversight Plan. The oversight plan was required to propose a group responsible for ongoing oversight of the MIDD action plan, the role of the group, and how the group would coordinate with other county groups. Ordinance 15949 also outlines the types of representation that should comprise the oversight group, including state, county, and community agencies and entities involved in the mental health, substance abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault, homeless, justice, public health, and hospital systems.   
Implementation Plan. The implementation plan was required to describe the implementation of the programs and services outlined in the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan, including a schedule for implementation; a discussion of needed resources; and milestones for program implementation. The implementation plan would also include a spending and financial plan developed in collaboration with the oversight group.   
Evaluation Plan. The Evaluation Plan was required to describe an evaluation and reporting plan for the programs funded with the MIDD sales tax, including a process and outcome evaluation component; a proposed schedule for evaluations; output and outcome measures and measure targets; and data elements that would be used for reporting and evaluations.  

Throughout 2007 and 2008, the County worked with community partners to develop the plans required by the original MIDD ordinance.  

The first plan to be adopted was the Oversight Plan, via Ordinance 16077, in April 2008. This plan established the MIDD Oversight Committee as an advisory body to the King County Executive and the Council. Its purpose is to ensure that the implementation and evaluation of the strategies and programs funded by the MIDD sales tax revenue are transparent, accountable, collaborative, and effective. The Oversight Committee first convened in June 2008 and has met approximately monthly ever since.  

The Implementation Plan was adopted via Ordinance 16261 in October 2008. It outlines the programs and services that would be funded by MIDD and the budget and spending plan for each. The Implementation Plan established that MIDD would support an integrated system of:  

Prevention and early intervention services Community-based treatment Expanded therapeutic court programs Jail and hospital diversion programs Housing and housing supportive services.  

The Implementation Plan was organized around five service areas that were subdivided into 37 different strategies. Each strategy is implemented through one or more programs that provide services for clients. Services are delivered either through County-based programs or through community-based programs contracted by the County. The following graphic illustrates the multi-layered structure of the MIDD Implementation Plan.

The Evaluation Plan was also adopted by Council via Ordinance 16262 in October 2008. The next section describes the main components of this plan.  

# Components of MIDD Evaluation Plan  

Ordinance 15949 specified that the evaluation plan was to “… describe an evaluation and reporting plan for the programs funded with the sales tax revenue (and) specify: process and outcome evaluation components; a proposed schedule for evaluations; performance measurements and performance measurement targets; and data elements that will be used for reporting and evaluations. Performance measures shall include, but not be limited to: the amount of funding contracted to date, the number and status of request for proposals to date, individual program status and statistics such as individuals served, data on utilization of the justice and emergency medical systems and resources needed to support the evaluation requirements identified in this subsection C.3. Part three shall be developed in collaboration with the oversight group.” (pp. 7-8)  

The MIDD Evaluation Plan outlines the rationale and intent to monitor and evaluate the strategies funded by MIDD. It includes an evaluation framework that is guided by a high-level logic model (Error! eference source not found.) and shows how MIDD strategies are expected to further the MIDD policy goals.  

![](images/1f769de79bb8b5fbd8cef4e102e37a4614e3ac4f17ff8fa92657eb08422f9a22.jpg)  

The MIDD Evaluation Plan has three main components:  

4. System Process Evaluation to describe how the implementation of MIDD is progressing.  

5. Strategy Process Evaluation to assess what was done.  

6. Outcome Evaluation to assess the effect of MIDD strategies on MIDD policy goals.  

The plan also includes an evaluation matrix that lists, for each MIDD strategy, the activities to be performed, output measures, output targets, outcome measures and data sources. In addition, the Evaluation Targets Addendum of the Evaluation Plan specifies targets for four of the five MIDD policy goals the King County Council sought to achieve with MIDD funding. The targets were based on the length of time until a program would be fully implemented and information from programs serving similar populations across the country.  

The following sections provide more detail about the three main components of the Evaluation Plan.  

# 1. System Process Evaluation  

The objectives of the System Process Evaluation are to describe how the implementation of MIDD is progressing, to identify unintended consequences of MIDD activities, and to establish a quality improvement feed-back loop to inform revisions to MIDD processes and strategies. In particular, the process evaluation component of the plan focuses on:  

Initial MIDD start-up activities   
Development and management of requests for proposal and service contracts   
Strategies to leverage and blend funding streams   
Efforts to coordinate the work of partners, stakeholders, and providers   
Implementation of working agreements and Memoranda of Understanding   
Service-level changes resulting from efforts to promote integration of housing, treatment, and   
supportive services   
System-level changes resulting from MIDD funds or the management of MIDD-related resources   
An evaluation the MIDD Action Plan’s integration with and support of system level goals and   
objectives as articulated in the Adult and Juvenile Justice Operational Master plans, the Plan to End   
Homelessness, the Veterans and Human Services Levy Service Improvement Plan, and the King   
County Mental Health Recovery Plan  

Much of the work on the system process evaluation was part of ongoing activities of the MIDD Oversight Committee. Aspects of the system process evaluation that were discussed by interviewees and were included in MIDD evaluation reporting are incorporated into this assessment, but the system process evaluation was not the primary focus of this assessment.  

# 2. Strategy Process Evaluation  

The objective of the Strategy Process Evaluation is to measure progress towards meeting the output goals specified in the MIDD evaluation matrix of the MIDD Evaluation Plan (see Appendix D). The Strategy Process Evaluation focuses on program reporting to provide transparency to constituents that funds are being used as intended. The Strategy Process Evaluation is available upon request.  

Output measures were adjusted over time based on input from evaluation staff, providers and the MIDD Oversight Committee to reflect changes in MIDD strategies, strategy implementation or data availability. Any changes to the measures are published in MIDD progress reports and must be adopted by the Council to become official.  

# 3. Outcome Evaluation  

The objective of the Outcome Evaluation is to measure whether MIDD-funded strategies achieve expected results. For each MIDD strategy, this entails selecting outcome measures that reflect the expected results, collecting data for each measure at multiple points in time for individuals served by MIDD, analyzing data to determine whether there were changes over time and publishing results in the MIDD annual and progress reports.  

Proximal measures selected for the MIDD Outcome Evaluation address behaviors, skills, knowledge, attitudes, and external circumstances relevant for individuals served by MIDD. Examples include screening for mental health and chemical dependency symptoms, symptom severity, enrolling in mental health treatment, skills and knowledge obtained in crisis intervention training, attitudes about stigma associated with mental health illness and risk factors impacting families and youth served by MIDD. The selected distal outcome measures reflect behavior and address jail utilization, emergency room visits and hospital use, that is, MIDD policy goals (1) through (4).  

# MIDD Evaluation Reporting  

Ordinance 15949 also specified what type of evaluation reporting would occur and when.  

“In addition to reviewing and approving the parts one, two and three of the oversight, implementation and evaluation plan outlined in subsection C. of this section, in coordination with the oversight group, the executive shall submit four quarterly progress reports and an one annual summary report for the  

programs supported with the sales tax revenue to the council. The quarterly reports shall include at a minimum:  

a. performance measurement statistics;  

b. program utilization statistics;  

c. request for proposal and expenditure status updates; and d. progress reports on evaluation implementation.  

2.a. The quarterly reports to the council are due to the council March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 for council review for years one and two and thereafter, every six months.  

b.(1) The annual report to the council shall be submitted to the council by April 1, for council review. The annual report shall also include:  

(a) a summary of quarterly report data; (b) updated performance measure targets for the following year of the programs; and (c) recommendations on program and/or process changes to the funded programs based on the measurement and evaluation data.” (pp. 8-9)  

Currently, the results of the evaluation work are published twice per year in two reports. The MIDD Annual Report, published in February of each year and transmitted to the Council with a motion to accept the report, summarizes the findings of the evaluation work for the most recent OctoberSeptember time period. Each report includes:  

A summary of the MIDD strategies that operated during the time period being evaluated   
A reminder of MIDD background, policy goals, and Oversight Committee membership   
The number of individuals served by type of service, as well as demographic information such as   
age, gender, race, and geography   
A summary of how each strategy progressed toward its output measurement targets during the   
period being evaluated   
A summary of outcome progress achieved by MIDD programs during the period being evaluated   
Recommendations for revisions to the Evaluation Plan for future evaluations to respond to changing   
services and information over time   
A financial report comparing budget to actual spending for the period being evaluated  

The MIDD Progress Report, published in August of each year, contains much of the same information as the annual report for the most recent October-March time period, as a way to check in on progress between annual reports. This report is transmitted to the Council as well.

# Appendix E: Additional Information on Logic Models  

A logic model, which is commonly used as an evaluation framework, shows inputs (resources needed and people involved), program activities, outputs (how much of an activity was delivered) and outcomes (what changed). While many good logic models exist that show a flow from inputs to outcomes (see Figure 4 on next page), the best logic models ensure that each element is measurable and that there is evidence to believe there is a relationship between the elements.  

A logic model is the foundation for an actionable plan that includes strategies with clearly defined outcomes and explicit steps for addressing the problems that were identified. Logic models describe the sequence of activities that is expected to bring about change and how the activities are linked to the desired results. The process of thinking through change includes:  

1) Identifying the problem(s): What is the community need?   
2) Naming the desired results: What is the vision for the future?   
3) Developing the strategies for achieving desired results: How can the vision be achieved?  

Having an actionable plan is essential for successful program implementation, continuous improvement activities, a useful evaluation, and, ultimately for accomplishing the desired results.

# Appendix F: Social Service Projects with Random Assignment Evaluations  

Randomized field experiments are the strongest research design for measuring the causal impact of an intervention.52 Conducting an evaluation with random assignment in a non-research setting can be challenging for a number of reasons, including ethical concerns (e.g., do services need to be withheld for some participants?), cost considerations (e.g., is money available to conduct such an evaluation?), or implementation challenges (e.g., will randomized groups ‘contaminate’ each other?).  

However, tight budgets and the desire to allocate public resources equitably have increased the need to know whether public-sector programs have their intended impact. As a result, random assignment is being used more often in evaluations of public-sector projects. Below are examples of projects that incorporated random assignment into their evaluation design. The examples are from the Pay for Success model, which leverages private funding up-front to ensure jurisdictions only pay for services when specified outcomes are met. Project details are available from the Nonprofit Finance Fund.53  

Connecticut Family Stability Pay for Success Project   
Led by the Connecticut Department of Children and Families and its partners, this project aims to   
promote family stability and reduce parental substance use for 500 families. The University of   
Connecticut Health Center leads the evaluation using a randomized controlled trial approach, which   
is described in the program documentation as “the gold standard for a rigorous evaluation.”54   
South Carolina Nurse-Family Partnership Pay for Success Project   
Focused on improving health outcomes for mothers and children living in poverty, this project   
extends the Nurse-Family Partnership services to 3,200 low-income mothers in the state. The   
Massachusetts Institute of Technology J-PAL North America leads the evaluation using a randomized   
controlled trial to determine whether the project meets its identified goals.55   
New York State Recidivism and Workforce Development Project   
This project focuses on reducing recidivism and increasing employment for 2,000 formerly   
incarcerated individuals in New York City and Rochester, New York.  The evaluation for this project   
also uses a randomized controlled trial.56   
The Denver Social Impact Bond Program   
This project will provide housing and supportive case management services to at least 250 homeless   
individuals who are frequent users of the city’s emergency services, such as police, jail, the courts,   
and emergency rooms. Eligible individuals will be randomly assigned to one of two groups – one   
group receives supportive housing as part of the initiative and another group “usual care” services.57

# Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

Part 3: Evaluation Plan  

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

# INTRODUCTION  

The Mental Illness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) Action Plan and the Metropolitan King County Council Ordinance 15949 define the expectations for the MIDD evaluation. The Ordinance calls for the plan to describe how the MIDD will be evaluated in terms of its impact and benefits and whether the MIDD achieves its goals.  It requires that:  

“…the evaluation plan shall describe an evaluation and reporting plan for the programs funded with the sales tax revenue.  Part three [the Evaluation Plan] shall specify: process and outcome evaluation components; a proposed schedule for evaluations; performance measurements and performance measurement targets; and data elements that will be used for reporting and evaluations.”  

The primary goal of the MIDD is to:  

Prevent and reduce chronic homelessness and unnecessary involvement in the criminal justice and emergency medical systems and promote recovery for persons with disabling mental illness and chemical dependency by implementing a full continuum of treatment, housing, and case management services.  

The Ordinance identified five policy goals:  

1. A reduction in the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent people using costly interventions like jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals   
2. A reduction in the number of people who recycle through the jail, returning repeatedly as a result of their mental illness or chemical dependency   
3. A reduction of the incidence and severity of chemical dependency and mental and emotional disorders in youth and adults   
4. Diversion of mentally ill and chemically dependent youth and adults from initial or further justice system involvement   
5. Explicit linkage with, and furthering the work of, other council directed efforts including, the Adult and Juvenile Justice Operational Master plans, the Plan to End Homelessness, the Veterans and Human Services Levy Service Improvement Plan and the King County Mental Health Recovery Plan.  

In the MIDD Action Plan, the MIDD Oversight Committee, the Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division (MHCADSD) and its stakeholders identified sixteen core strategies and corresponding sub-strategies (see Appendix for a list and description of strategies) for service improvement, enhancement and expansion to address these goals.

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan demonstrate effective use of MIDD funds and to assess whether the MIDD goals are being achieved, on both individual program and system levels.  Results from the ongoing evaluation will be regularly reported on though quarterly and annual reports that will be reviewed by the MIDD Oversight Committee and transmitted to the King County Executive and Metropolitan King County Council.  It also should be noted that the Evaluation Plan will evolve and change as the strategies evolve and change.  Changes to the Evaluation Plan will be included in the regular reports as described above.  

# OVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATION PLAN  

# MIDD Framework  

The MIDD Evaluation Plan establishes a framework for evaluating each of the 16 core strategies and sub-strategies in the MIDD Implementation Plan, by measuring what is done (output), how it is done (process), and the effects of what is done (outcome). Measuring what is done entails determining if the service has occurred.  Measuring how an intervention is done is more complex and may involve a combination of contract monitoring, as well as process and outcome evaluation to determine if a program is being implemented as intended.  Measuring the effects of what is done is also complex, and will require the use of both basic quantitative and qualitative methods as appropriate  

The evaluation framework ties the MIDD goals and strategies to the MIDD results.  It lays out the links between what is funded, what is expected to happen as a result of those funds, and how those results will contribute to realizing the MIDD goals and objectives. The schematic diagram below shows the high level relationships between the components of the framework.

# MIDD Logic Model  

![](images/404ae8ecc063b750d3c24787b7bb833bc6ad7e71186e6b29b5ea6a4f4ed74246.jpg)  

The MIDD Plan is designed to be a comprehensive approach to create improvements across the continuum of services.  Multiple and oftentimes interrelated interventions are designed to achieve the policy goals (e.g., reducing caseloads, increasing funding, enhancing workforce development activities and service capacity are expected to collectively reduce incarceration and use of emergency services).  Many of the outcomes expected from the MIDD interventions are highly correlated to each other. For example, a decrease in mental health symptoms can lead to a decrease in crisis episodes, which can lead to a decrease in incarcerations, which can lead to an increase in housing stability, which can lead to a further decrease in mental health symptoms, and so on. Interventions that have an impact on any one of these outcomes can therefore be expected to have some impact on the other outcomes. The specifics of each intervention and the population it is targeting will determine which outcome(s) will be impacted in the short-term and how much additional time will be necessary before other longer-term outcomes will be seen. (Examples of longer term outcomes include reduction in jail recidivism and/or rehospitalizations, or prevention of substance abuse in children of substance abusing parents.)  

# 1. Process Evaluation  

The first component of the MIDD evaluation is a process evaluation that will assess how the MIDD is being implemented at both the system and strategy levels.  

MIDD Evaluation Plan Page 3 of 10  

# King County  

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

# A. System Process Evaluation  

The system process evaluation will provide a general assessment of how implementation is progressing.  Sometimes referred to as an ‘implementation status report’, this type of evaluation may also answer specific programmatic questions (e. g., “How can we improve the quality of training for chemical dependency specialists?").  

The system process evaluation will examine:  

$\cdot$ Initial startup activities (e.g., acquiring space, hiring and training staff, developing policies and procedures)   
$\cdot$ Development and management of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and contracts for services   
$\cdot$ Strategies to leverage and blend multiple funding streams   
$\cdot$ Efforts to coordinate the work of partners, stakeholders, and providers   
$\cdot$ Implementation of working agreements and Memoranda of Understanding   
$\cdot$ Service-level changes that occur as the result of efforts to promote integration of housing, treatment, and supportive services   
$\cdot$ Systems-level changes that occur as a result of the use of MIDD funds or the management of MIDD related resources   
$\cdot$ An evaluation of the MIDD Action Plan’s integration with and support o system level goals and objectives, as articulated in the Adult and Juvenil Justice Operational Master plans, the Plan to End Homelessness, the Veterans and Human Services Levy Service Improvement Plan and the King County Mental Health Recovery Plan.  

The goal of the system process evaluation is not only to capture what actually happens as the MIDD is implemented, but also to identify the unintended consequences of MIDD activities (e.g., circumstances that were not anticipated or were unusual in ways that helped or hindered MIDD-related work).  

The system process evaluation establishes a quality improvement feedback loop as implementation progresses.  Areas needing additional effort will be identified in order to make any needed mid-course adjustments.  Evaluation activities will increase opportunities to learn about and practice service and system integration strategies.  

# King County  

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

# B. Strategy Process Evaluation  

In addition to the system process evaluation, evaluation at the strategy level will measure performance and assess progress toward meeting specified performance goals. These performance measures and goals are specified as outputs in the evaluation matrices at the end of the document (See Appendix).  

# 2. Outcome Evaluation  

The outcome evaluation will assess the impact of the funded services and programs on the MIDD goals. This approach consists of evaluating the full range of program outcomes in the context of a logical framework. The evaluation matrix designed for this part of the evaluation links the MIDD goals and strategies to the MIDD results and provides a structure for identifying performance indicators, targets and data sources, and for collecting and reporting results.  

The MIDD outcome evaluation is broader than a program evaluation or a series of program evaluations. The framework defines the expected outcomes for each program and helps demonstrate how these outcomes individually and collectively contribute to the achievement of the overall goals of the MIDD.  

# A. Strategies  

Evaluating the impact of the MIDD Action Plan is a multifaceted endeavor. There are multiple target populations, goals, strategies, programs, interventions, providers, administrators, partners, locations, timelines, and expected results.  The comprehensive evaluation strategy is designed to demonstrate whether the expected results are being achieved and whether value is returned on MIDD investments.  

Underlying principles for the outcome evaluation include:  

$\cdot$ The evaluation will build upon existing evaluation activities and coordinate with current and/or developing information systems (e.g., Strategy 7b, expanded Children’s Crisis Outreach Response System).   
$\cdot$ When the implementation of a strategy will take multiple years, making it impossible to immediately demonstrate any long-term outcomes, the evaluation will establish intermediate outcomes to show that the strategy is on course to achieve results (e.g., Strategy 4b, Prevention Services to Children of Substance Abusers).  

# King County  

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

The evaluation will coordinate its activities with MIDD administrative activities, including RFPs, contract management, etc.  Process and outcome data collection will be incorporated into ongoing monitoring functions and will support regional coordination of data collection.  

The MIDD Action Plan specifies that the MIDD dollars be used to fund effective practices and strategies.  Evaluation approaches can range from purely verifying that something happened to comparing intervention results with a statistically valid control group to ascertain causality.  The MIDD evaluation will utilize the strongest and also the most feasible evaluation design for each strategy.  

An evaluation that requires a control group to prove that a program is the cause of any effects can be expensive and time consuming. In general, it will not be possible for an evaluation of most MIDD programs to include a control or comparison group to show a causal relationship.  Establishing a control or comparison group would require that some individuals not receive services so that they can be compared with those who receive services. However, there may be situations when a ‘natural’ comparison group may be used if feasible.  

$\cdot$ A proven program, such as an evidence-based practice, has already had an evaluation utilizing a control or comparison group.  When the MIDD strategies fund practices and services that are currently working or have been proven to work elsewhere, there is no need to again prove a causal relationship. Instead, the evaluation will focus on measuring the quantity and results of MIDD funded services, in addition to their adherence to fidelity measures.  

$\cdot$ For many strategies a proven program and/or best practice will be substantially modified in order to be useful to the specific populations targeted by the MIDD.  Evaluation of these programs will stress on-going monitoring and early feedback so that any necessary changes can take place in a timely manner.  Short-term results will be identified as a marker of which longer-term desired outcomes are likely to be detected. This formative type of evaluation will help ensure that the program is functioning as intended.  

# B.  Evaluation Matrix  

Organizing an evaluation as complex as this requires a systematic approach.  An evaluation matrix has been designed for compiling the needed information for each sub-strategy.  Completed evaluation matrices for each sub-strategy specify  

# Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

what data are needed from which sources and what program level evaluations are needed.  

The evaluation framework also describes how data will be collected. Baseline information about the target population and their use of services will be obtained. To provide results related to racial disproportionality and cultural competency, data about race, ethnicity, and language will also be collected.  Some of the data can be obtained immediately from existing sources such as the King County Regional Support Network database, Safe Harbors, and TARGET (the state Division of Alcohol and Substance Abuse database).  Accessing other data may require an investment of resources and time (e.g., developing data sharing agreements to obtain information regarding emergency room use in outlying hospitals).  Any changes to a particular strategy that occur as implementation progresses may signal a needed modification to the evaluation matrix.  A template for the evaluation matrix follows; completed matrices can be found in the Appendix.

# 3. Timeline  

The lifespan of the MIDD Action Plan extends through December 31, 2016.  The evaluation must demonstrate value to the taxpayer throughout the life of the MIDD Plan.  

An evaluation timeline is attached (See Attachment A).  It shows proposed evaluation activities in relation to the MIDD implementation timeline(s).  As individual strategies are finalized, evaluation dates may be adjusted.  These dates will balance the need for ongoing reporting to meet MIDD oversight requirements with the lifecycles of individual strategy evaluations.  It must be stressed that results for both short and long term outcomes may not be available for months or even years, depending upon the strategy.  

MIDD Evaluation Plan Page 7 of 10  

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

MIDD programs will begin at different times and reach their respective conclusions on different schedules. Data may be readily available or may require system upgrades and/or data sharing agreements before the information is accessible.  For each program the evaluation timeline addresses:  

$\cdot$ When the program will start (or when the MIDD funding will be initiated)   
$\cdot$ At what point a sufficient number of clients will have reached the outcome to generate a statistically reliable result   
$\cdot$ When baseline and indicator data may be reported   
$\cdot$ The requirements for reporting on process and outcome data  

# 4. Reporting  

In accordance with the Ordinance, MHCADSD will report on the status and progress of the programs supported with MIDD funds.  During the first two years of the MIDD implementation, quarterly reports will be submitted to the Executive and Council for review. Thereafter reports will be submitted every six months and annually.  At a minimum these reports will include:  

$\cdot$ Performance measure statistics   
$\cdot$ Program utilization statistics   
$\cdot$ Request for proposal and expenditure status updates $\cdot$ Progress reports on the implementation of the evaluation.  

In addition, the annual report will also include “a summary of quarterly report data, updated performance measure targets for the upcoming year, and recommendations for program/process improvements based on the measurement and evaluation data”.  

The existing service system is constantly evolving in response to funding, changing needs, and other environmental influences.  Reports will show how the administration of the MIDD Plan both responds to these influences and has an impact on the system at large.  

# 5. Evaluation Matrices  

The Appendix includes the evaluation matrix for each sub-strategy.  More specific information may be added for each individual activity as the program is implemented  

MIDD Evaluation Plan Page 8 of 10  

# Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

and evolves.  For strategies that are still being developed, outcomes may be marked “TBD” (To Be Determined).  When strategies are further developed or modified following initial implementation, new or revised outcomes will be developed, and included in the quarterly reports.  

# ADDENDUM:  EVALUATION APPROACH  

The MIDD Evaluation Plan was developed in the context of existing quality management approaches currently utilized by the Department of Community and Human Services (DCHS) and the Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division (MHCADSD).  MHCADSD is responsible for the publicly funded mental health and substance abuse treatment systems, and as such is obligated to assure the quality, appropriateness, availability and cost effectiveness of treatment services.  MHCADSD must demonstrate to federal, state, and county government the capacity to operate and monitor a complex network of service providers.  This is accomplished through wellestablished quality assurance and improvement strategies, including contract development and monitoring, setting expectations for performance, conducting periodic review of performance, and offering continuous feedback to providers regarding successes and needed improvements.  In that context, all MIDD contracts will specify what the provider is expected to do, including service provision, data submission, and reporting of key deliverables.  The MIDD evaluation will extend beyond the contract monitoring process to assess whether services were performed effectively, and whether they resulted in improved outcomes for the individuals involved in those services.  

The MIDD Evaluation Plan was developed by MHCADSD program evaluation staff whose collective experience with program evaluation, performance measurement, research, and quality improvement is summarized in Attachment B. The MHCADSD System Performance Evaluation team will continue to provide leadership and staffing to assure that the evaluation proceeds in a timely and transparent manner.  The ongoing evaluation of the MIDD will involve coordination with MIDD Oversight Committee, stakeholders, providers, and other agencies responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of related or overlapping programs (Veteran’s and Human Services Levy Service Improvement Plan, Committee to End Homelessness, Public Health of Seattle/King County, United Way Blueprint to End Chronic Homelessness, City of Seattle, University of Washington, etc.).  

The Evaluation Plan and the evaluation matrices for each individual strategy were developed directly from the individual implementation strategies.  Some strategies are still in the process of being developed; therefore the evaluation matrices for those strategies will need to be revised as plans are finalized.  Updates to the Evaluation Plan will be included in the quarterly, bi-annual, and annual reports reviewed by the MIDD Oversight Committee and transmitted to the King County Executive and Metropolitan  

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

King County Council.  The Plan utilizes a basic approach to evaluation: measure what is done (output), how it is done (process), and the effects of what is done (outcome).  

Measuring what is done is usually straightforward, as it entails determining if the service has occurred. For example, Strategy 1d aims to increase access to “next day” appointments for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis.  The evaluation will determine whether the program met its target of increasing availability of next day appointments for an additional 750 people.   
$\cdot$ Measuring how an intervention is done is more complex and may involve a combination of contract monitoring (MHCADSD contract staff review agency policies and procedures, client charts, staff credentials, billing, etc.), and process and outcome evaluation to determine if a program is being implemented as intended.   
$\cdot$ Measuring the effects of what is done can vary in complexity. The outcome evaluation of MIDD activities will utilize basic quantitative and qualitative methods as appropriate.  Many outcome indicators are a measurement of change. The Evaluation Plan uses terms such as ‘increase’, ‘decrease’, ‘expand’ or ‘improve’-- all of which imply a difference from what was happening before the intervention occurred.  Baseline data will be needed in order to measure whether there has been any change.  Targets for improvement will vary, depending on what is currently happening (e.g., percentage of individuals receiving mental health services who are employed) and how long it will take to see results, taking into account the combined impact of all the MIDD strategies.  

Data collected on performance will offer a rich opportunity to analyze how the MIDD strategies are impacting people throughout the county, in parts of the county, and at specific providers.  Every effort will be made to utilize existing data and reports to avoid unnecessary administrative burden.  Through both ongoing contract monitoring and evaluation activities providers will receive feedback about the effectiveness of their strategies and will be held accountable to make any needed changes to ensure the expected results are achieved over time.  Monitoring and evaluation results will be used to support quality improvements and revisions to MIDD strategies, to highlight successes, and to demonstrate cost effectiveness to the taxpayer.

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

Proposed Targets for Key MIDD Policy Goals  

At the request of the Operating Budget, Fiscal Management, and Select Issues Committee and the Regional Policy Committee, King County Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division (MHCADSD) has established targets for key Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan (MIDD) policy goals established in King County Council Ordinance 15949.  

The target areas addressed here include: (a) a reduction in the number of jail bookings/detentions for individuals served in MIDD programs, (b) a reduction in the jail detention population with serious mental illness (SMI) or severe emotional disturbance (SED), (c) a reduction in homelessness as measured by formerly homeless adults served by MIDD housing programs who remain in stable housing after one year, (d) a reduction in emergency room visits among individuals served by MIDD programs, and (e) a reduction in inpatient psychiatric hospital admissions among individuals served by MIDD programs. As identified in County Ordinance 15949, the outcomes presented here are explicitly linked to the following MIDD policy goals:  

o A reduction in the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent people using costly interventions like jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals   
o A reduction in the number of people who recycle through the jail, returning repeatedly as a result of their mental illness or chemical dependency   
o Diversion of mentally ill and chemically dependent youth and adults from initial or further justice system involvement  

Targets for the broad MIDD policy goals were established based on the assumption that a set of programs has been up and running for one full year and has enrolled enough participants to detect significant changes.  The programs within the MIDD strategies will build on each other and also improve over time and as such, targets will change over time. Some of the programs that we expect to have the largest impact (e.g., housing and crisis diversion) will be fully implemented anywhere from one to four years after other programs have been in operation.  We have therefore developed targets that change over time, as programs develop and increase effectiveness and as more programs come on line.  

We have based the development of our outcome targets on information we have from programs serving populations similar to those served by MIDD, and on program results from similar programs across the country.  There are, however, a number of factors that cannot be predicted but may directly influence whether the anticipated targets are achieved. Factors such as changes in law enforcement policies and funding, significant changes in the economy, changes in Federal entitlement and housing funding and  

MIDD Evaluation Plan Page 12 of 10  

# King County  

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan policies, state funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment, and population growth may affect the number of jail admissions regardless of MIDD strategy implementation. Furthermore, there are a number of local and state initiatives that directly influence outcomes associated with the MIDD. For example, the MacArthur Models for Change Initiative is focusing on juvenile justice reform; the King County Systems Integration Initiative is addressing issues of coordination, collaboration, and blending resources for multi-system youth; and the Ten-year Plan to End Homelessness and the Veterans and Human Services Levy are working to increase the availability of housing and services for homeless individuals.  Consistent with the fifth policy goal, the MIDD Evaluation will track coordination and linkage with these other Council directed efforts through a process evaluation.  

# Baseline Data  

In some cases, sufficient baseline data for some of the subsets of the five policy goals across all of King County does not exist.  Such baseline data will be established during the first year of full strategy implementation.  Data sharing agreements will be executed with many municipalities and entities in order to create a comprehensive baseline to ensure accurate baseline estimates and to continue to collect such data on an ongoing basis to monitor targeted outcomes.  For example, baseline data on particular populations will include youth with mental health disorders in King County Juvenile Detention and adults with SMI in jails across King County.  

# Monitoring and Evaluation  

Monitoring and evaluation results will be used to support quality improvements and revisions to MIDD strategies, to highlight successes, and to demonstrate cost effectiveness to the taxpayer.  

These targets may be adjusted to account for changes in program implementation. Monitoring outcomes at short-term, intermediate, and long-term phases will allow us to make changes in program implementation based on the targeted outcomes.  

As programs in the MIDD Implementation Plan are implemented and evolve over time, the Evaluation Plan will be updated accordingly to accurately measure the effectiveness and impact of each individual strategy.  

Tests for statistical significance will be used to address the question: What is the probability that the relationship between variables (e.g., MIDD program and an outcome) is due to chance? The influence of certain known factors that may bias the results, such as attrition and population growth, will be examined.

In each of the figures below, the percent reduction (or increase) in the policy goal is shown by year.  The baseline year is the year prior to when a set of programs have been up and running for one full year.

Figure 1:  Targeted Reduction in the Number of Jail/Detention Admissions Among Mentally Ill and Chemically Dependent Individuals Served by MIDD Programs  

# Proportion of Jail/Detention Admissions among Individuals served by MIDD Programs  

o For adults, we have set a target of a $5\%$ reduction in the number of jail bookings among individuals served by MIDD programs, one year after the MIDD programs are up and running. In subsequent years, the additional target reductions are $10\%$ for subsequent years two through five for a total reduction of $45\%$ . It should be noted tha the total reduction of $45\%$ only refers to those individuals who receive MIDD services, which is a smaller proportion of those individuals in jail (e.g., the MIDD will not reduce the jail population by $45\%$ ).   
o For youth, we have set a target of a $10\%$ reduction in the proportion of juvenile detentions among youth served by MIDD programs one year after the MIDD programs are up and running.  For the next four subsequent years, additional reductions of $10\%$ each year are anticipated for a total reduction of $50\%$ . While  

# Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

baseline estimates were not available, the outcomes are based on results reported in Skowyra & Cocozza (2007) (see References).

Figure 2:  Targeted Decline in the Percent of Jail/Detention Population with Severe Mental Illness (adults) /Severe Emotional Disorder (youth)   
In 2007, there were approximately 17.5 Individuals with SMI per thousand in the adult detention population.  

# Jail/Detention Population with SMI/SED  

o For adults, we have set a target of a $3\%$ reduction in the percentage of the jail population with SMI/SED, one year after the MIDD programs are up and running. In subsequent years, the additional target reductions are $3\%$ , $6\%$ , $8\%$ , and $10\%$ for subsequent years two through five for a total reduction of $30\%$ . It should be emphasized that the total reduction of $30\%$ only refers to those individuals with SMI/SED, which is a small proportion of those individuals in jail (e.g., the MIDD will not reduce the jail population by $30\%$ ).   
o For youth, we have set a target of a $10\%$ reduction in the juvenile detention population with severe emotional disturbance, one year after the MIDD programs are up and running. In subsequent years, the additional target reductions are $10\%$ for years two through five for a total reduction of $50\%$ .   
o An important caveat is that there is no consistently adopted standard definition for SMI or SED (this is particularly true for youth) across jail/detention facilities. Variations in the definitions of these diagnoses make it difficult to extrapolate from  

# Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan  

various studies and programs findings.  The MIDD Evaluation Team will work to ensure consistency of definitions within the MIDD evaluation.

The 2006 One Night Homelessness Count in King County indicated that almost half of the 5,963 homeless individuals counted in shelters or transitional housing had problems with mental illness or substance abuse.  

# Housing Stability among the Formerly Homeless Receiving MIDD Housing Services  

$\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{~o~}$ For homeless adults, we have set a target after one full year of implementation of the MIDD housing strategy, $60\%$ of formerly homeless adults will be able to maintain housing stability for 12 consecutive months. In subsequent years, the additional target reductions are that $80\%$ will achieve housing stability in year two with a total of $90\%$ of individuals attaining housing stability five years after the implementation of the housing strategy.   
o The NY, NY Agreement Cost Study found that $70\%$ of formerly homeless individuals with diagnoses of severe and persistent mental illness remained in housing after one year (Culhane, 2002).  

Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan o The Closer to Home Initiative evaluation focused on six programs in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Evaluation results from these programs indicated that among formerly homeless adults with the most severe psychiatric disorders, $79\%$ remained in housing after one year.

o A comprehensive program for the chronically homeless called the HHISN (i.e., the Lyric and Canon Kip Community House in San Francisco) found that after 12 months of moving into supportive housing, there was a $56\%$ decline in emergency room use among adults.

# Effectiveness of MIDD Strategies in Reducing Emergency Department Use  

Fourteen MIDD strategies had a primary or secondary policy goal of reducing emergency room use by mentally ill or drug dependent clients, as shown below. Data were provided by Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA in order to monitor changes in use of their emergency department over time.

# Emergency Department Reduction Goals  

Incremental and cumulative goals for reduction of emergency room use by MIDD participants were established in an Evaluation Targets Addendum dated September 2, 2008, as shown in the grid below. The incremental reduction goals for each post period represent an additional reduction from the pre period (the year prior to an individual’s MIDD start date), rather than a reduction from the previous post period. The green highlighting indicates adequate data availability for most strategies (as of February 2015) for preliminary assessment of long-term effectiveness.

# Effectiveness of MIDD Strategies in Reducing Community  

Ten MIDD strategies had a primary or secondary policy goal of reducing psychiatric hospital utilization by individuals with mental illness, as shown below. Data from community inpatient psychiatric hospitals in King County were combined with data from Western State Hospital in order to monitor changes by strategy in the average number of days hospitalized per year over time.

# Psychiatric Hospitalization Reduction Goals  

Incremental and cumulative goals for reduction of psychiatric hospital use by MIDD participants were established in an Evaluation Targets Addendum dated September 2, 2008, as shown in the grid below. Although the original targeted reductions were based on admissions, the average number of days per year more fully captures utilization of psychiatric hospitals. While psychiatric admissions and days are closely correlated, days hospitalized can vary widely between individuals. The incremental reduction goals for each post period represent an additional reduction from the pre period (the year prior to an individual’s MIDD start date), rather than a reduction from the previous post period. The green highlighting indicates adequate data availability for most strategies (as of February 2016) for preliminar assessment of long-term effectiveness.  

The green line shown on graphs over the next several pages indicates the ultimate expected reduction from Pre to Post 5 for strategy participants eligible for the longest time period who had psychiatric hospitalizations in any time period, unless stated otherwise.

# Effectiveness of MIDD Strategies in Reducing Jail Use  

Eleven MIDD strategies had a primary policy goal of reducing jail use by individuals with mental illness or drug dependency. Another three strategies listed this policy goal as secondary. Reducing jail recycling for MIDD clients was a primary objective for five other strategies, and diversion from initial or further justice system involvement was indicated as either a primary or secondary goal for 11 strategies, as shown in the grid below. Strategies grayed out in the table above were never implemented or were piloted without adequate data for change over time analysis.

# Jail Use Reduction Goals  

Separate goals for adults and youth (below right) were established in an Evaluation Targets Addendum dated September 2, 2008. For adults, an extra five percent reduction per year was recently added to account for overall declines in general population jail use between 2008 and 2013. Incremental reductions are those that occur from one measurement period to the next, starting from the pre period (or the year prior to the start of MIDD services). Cumulative reductions refer to the ultimate changes from the pre period to each post period. The green line shown on graphs over the next several pages indicates the ultimate expected reduction from Pre to Post 5 for strategy participants eligible for the longest time period who had jail use in any time period, unless stated otherwise.

Strategies with fewer average jail days in the pre period have less room for improvement.  

- Strategy 5a—Juvenile Justice Assessments - Strategy 8a—Family Treatment Court  

# Increases in Jail Use Associated with Start of MIDD Services  

Several strategies showed significant increases in average jail days during the first year of MIDD services. For therapeutic courts, jail sanctions are often used to increase program compliance. For criminal justice programs, adjudication of additional charges may factor in. Strategies with first year increases may need extra time to reach their goals.

Strategies that began operating with MIDD funds after October 2011, such as Strategy 4c—School-Based Services, have limited data for effectiveness analysis. Of the 46 students eligible for the first post period who had any secure detentions, their average number of days detained increased from 0.85 (Pre) to 17.02 (Post 1). The subset of those students who were eligible for a second post period further increased their average days detained from 17.24 (Post 1) to 32.32 (Post 2). There were no students eligible for the third post period who had any detentions at all, as shown below.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Symptom Reduction Tool</td><td>Summary</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Severity Summary (PSS)</td><td>The PSS was adopted to measure mental illness symptom changes over time in adults. The PSS is an inventory used to assess the functioning level for adults in a number of life domains.

The PSS assesses 14 dimensions, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, psychosis (thought disorders), and</td></tr><tr><td>Children's Functional Assessment Rating Scale (CFARS)</td><td>dissociation (unreality). The PSS also notes cognitive impairment. CFARS is a clinician-rated tool used for standardizing impressions from assessment of cognitive, social, and role functioning in children/youth. It includes measures for 16 domains, including depression and anxiety. Ratings are assigned using a 9-point scale where 1 is "no problem" and 9 is a "severe problem."</td></tr><tr><td>Addiction Severity Index (ASI)</td><td>The ASl is a semi-structured interview for substance abuse assessment and treatment planning. The ASl is designed to gather valuable information about areas of a client's life that may contribute to their substance-abuse problems.</td></tr><tr><td>PHQ-9 (part of the Patient Health Questionnaire)</td><td>The PHQ-9 has cut points of 5, 10, and 15 to indicate mild, moderate, and severe levels.

# Enumeration of All Performance Measurements and Summary of Performance Outcomes  

On the following three pages, performance measurements used over the life of all MIDD-funded strategies, programs, and services are shown in the rows labeled “Target”. Performance outcomes are show in the rows labeled “Actual” (raw numbers) and $4\%$ of Target” (percentages). Results are provided by the following MIDD strategy groupings: Strategies with Programs to Help Youth, Community-Based Care Strategies, and Jail and Hospital Diversion Strategies. Where targets differed in any given year from those posted in the “Original or Revised Target” column, an explanatory notation has been provided in the far right column under “Target Adjustments and Notes”. Where actual achievement was lower than 65 percent of the annual or adjusted target, the percentage is highlighted in red. Where achievement ranged from 65 to 85 percent of target, the percentage is highlighted in yellow. Achievements in excess of 85 percent of the posted targets are unmarked. In all tables, FTE refers to full-time equivalent staffing.

# Unmet Annual Performance Measurement Targets and Supplantation Programs Receiving MIDD Funding Prior to 2016  

Of the 37 original MIDD strategies, 19 (51%) had annual performance measurement targets that were unmet at least one time between 2008 and 2015. Targets were considered unmet if less than 85 percent of the established goal was achieved after adjustment. Adjustments were typically made when fewer programs or staff positions were funded than planned, when start-up allowances were made, and when programs were unable to fill staff vacancies.  The table below shows which strategies underperformed, when they fell short of expectations and by how much, most likely reasons for not meeting their goals, and the actions taken to correct identified issues.
