# Prime Minister ’s Report  

MESSAGE BY PRIME MINISTER DR. KENNY D ANTHONY TO THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR JULY 2004 – JUNE 2005  

Our societies are increasingly becoming more complex.  The dynamics of an everchanging social order is producing a new type of citizenry who are more astute and correspondingly have greater expectations in terms of the quality and quantity of services which they now demand.  This development coincides with a period where it is universally accepted that there is a need to bridge the divide between the haves and haves nots as a prerequisite for the maintenance of social order, social justice, social equity and social cohesion.  The demands of creating a more inclusive society mandate that those who live under extreme conditions of poverty and deprivation are provided with better access to markets and institutions, health care services, educational opportunities, greater job security and access to productive assets in order to effect both a qualitative and quantitative shift in their standards of living.  

The failure of any society to do so invariably renders the poor and defenseless susceptible to the shocks caused by life’s cycle of changes, economic reforms and other types of events such as illness.  The vulnerability of the poor to socio-economic shocks can be reduced by policies that protect their livelihoods, increase their human capital and assist them in times of crisis.  Although economic growth is a critical factor in the promotion of better standards of living, it has not been proven that economic growth is a sufficient condition to promote social development and to increase equality. Pockets of poverty can persist due to the inability of some population groups to participate in the growth process. Consequently, protection mechanisms against poverty, destitution and uncertainties are needed in order to safeguard the vulnerable segments of the population against contingencies and uncertainties.  

Unquestionably poverty is a social ill which can be explosive.  Therefore incidence of poverty must be reduced.  It is in keeping with this broad overall objective of reducing poverty that the social policy programme has evolved.  The role of social security policies is primarily to provide some form of safety net to vulnerable sectors but more importantly to provide some level of protection against increased deprivation and the promotion of better chances for individual survival.  In this sense social protection policies address not only the negative outcomes of development but also promote more equal opportunities amongst all population groups, thereby reducing the likelihood of negative outcomes.  

When the National Insurance Corporation was formed in $\lVert\rVert\mathfrak{S}\rVert(0)_{0}$ the philosophy underscoring its creation was the need to provide these safety nets for the vulnerable sectors of the population.  Its creation was also spurred by the realization that the society had a moral obligation to care for the least fortunate and there was a need for the establishment of a mechanism which would enable the cost for the provision of social services to be shared by the state, its citizens and other social partners.  

From its inception the Corporation has been synonymous with the provision of social security benefits and generations of Saint Lucians have benefited from the wide range of services that the Corporation has provided through the years.  However, cognizant of the changing times the National Insurance Corporation has been involved in a continuous process of redefining its role and functions in order to better meet the needs of the public that it serves.  

Through the years, the National Insurance Corporation has developed an unquestionable reputation among a wide cross-section of the Saint Lucian populace for the significant contribution it has made and continues to make towards the overall development of Saint Lucia.  Today, the Corporation is viewed as an indispensable partner in the overall developmental framework of the island.  

The National Insurance Corporation has left its imprint on many aspects of Saint Lucian life and society.  It is the largest single contributor to domestic saving.  In this regard it provides a pool of long-term savings that can be utilized to finance socio-economic development.  Its contribution to overall liquidity has made possible investments in housing, education, tourism, the fishing industry, professional services, agriculture and social infrastructure. Consequently, the National Insurance Corporation has functioned as a major engine of growth and development within the context of the Saint Lucian Economy.  

Truly the National Insurance Corporation is a model institution.  It has provided leadership and partnership in the task of nation building. It is my hope that this noble Saint Lucian institution grows from strength to strength and remains a permanent fixture in the social and economic landscape of our country.

# Chairman’s Statement  

Our theme “Workingtogetherwithprideto buildournation” depicts a true reflection of what took place at the National Insurance Corporation (NIC) for the period under review. For many years and in many ways the NIC has assisted in nation building and this year was no exception.  The thrust for this year was placed on getting the new Surgi -theatre at the Victoria Hospital completed and operational. This new theatre was a gift to the People of St. Lucia on the occasion of the country’s 25th Independence Anniversary.  

The NIC also played a pivotal role in getting the much talked about Universal Health Care Program to its present stage where it has become a topic of common house hold discussions.  

In addition, the NIC worked steadfastly along side the Board of Directors of  Blue Coral Ltd to commence the refurbishment and remodeling of the Blue Coral Building.  The final product we all expect will assist in rejuvenating the main city centre of our nation.  

During the year under review we continued to remain focused on the core business of the NIC which is the collection of contributions and the payment of benefits.  The Corporation placed much effort on collecting arrears of contributions.  Much focus was also placed on the building of our investment portfolios.  

# Investments  

For the year 2004/05 the local financial institutions continued to experience high liquidity, which resulted in low interest rates. The Board & Investment Committee however, continued to employ sound strategies in investing the funds of our contributors.  The Corporation was very prudent in its investments and always ensured that all investments would add value to its portfolio. The following are the investments undertaken during the period under review:-  

1. Purchased \$5 million of 5-year Government of Saint Lucia Notes (yielding $5.7\textcircled{\div}\%$ and \$29 million of 10-year Government of Saint Lucia Bonds (yielding $\widehat{\mathbf{\delta}}$ ) by converting \$12 million of Government of Saint Lucia Treasury Bills and paying \$22 million.  

2. Purchased \$5 million of 6-year $\textcircled{\div}\%$ Government of Saint Lucia Notes and \$27 million of 10-year 7% Government of Saint Lucia bonds paid for by converting \$12 million of Treasury Bills in addition to paying \$20 million  

3. Purchased US\$1 million of Government of Barbados Eurobonds and US\$1 million of Government of Trinidad and Tobago Eurobonds both yielding 5.15% for a 12-month holding period.  

4. The National Insurance Board approved a loan of $\$800,000$ to the National Research and Development Foundation to finance small contractors engaged in various road works.   
5. In February 2005, the NIC invested $\cup\S\$10$ million in a Tactical Bond Fund managed by UBS Global Asset Management.   
6. Purchased 123,992 square feet of land adjacent to the John Compton Highway for $\$6.95$ million.   
7. The National Insurance Board approved a loan of $\$40$ million to the Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority for the rehabilitation of the George F L Charles Airport and the rehabilitation and modernization of the Northern Wharf.   
8. Investment in fixed deposits increased by $\$9.8$ million during the year ending June 2005.  Deposits were placed at rates ranging from 3.5 to $7\%$ for terms from one to three years.  

# Blue Coral Ltd  

The year under review could be considered a very strategic one for Blue Coral Ltd. The Board of Directors was engaged principally in charting a clear and viable path for the transformation of the Building.  

The Architectural firm of Newel Lewis Broadbridge Associates W.I Ltd and Melon Designs partnered to provide the architectural design which was presented to members of the public.  The concept of the remodeled building will create an unparalleled shopping experience as well as a place for spending leisure time.  The concept makes provision for the following:-  

Ground floor First floor Second floor  

Café and shop units   
ranging from 700 –   
2300 sq ft   
Shop units ranging   
from 600 – 2300 sq ft   
Cinema/Theatre,   
Bar/lounge, open   
space (which could be   
used for Fitness   
Centre or as   
required by tenant)   
Sky Garden   
Restaurant, Roof   
Terrance, Bamboo   
Garden  

Third floor  

An animation of the model of the Building can   
be viewed on the website   
www.bluecoralslu.com  

Tenders were invited and the Construction firm of Lawrence and Associates was awarded the contract for refurbishing the Building.  

A number of local firms were sub-contracted for the provision of plumbing, electrical, air conditioning and elevator and escalator installations.

The firm of Charles Heywood & Company Ltd was contracted to provide Project Management services and NIPRO has been contracted to provide Clerk of Works Services on behalf of Blue Coral Ltd.  

We have embraced an investment that will transform the heart of the City of Castries.  The Board of Blue Coral Ltd pledges to do all within its power to successfully complete this initiative so that it can provide value to its Shareholders.  

National Housing Corporation (NHC)  

The NHC loan balance at year end stands at $\$39.3$ million.  

The Board continued its dialogue with Government and the Board of NHC with a view to liquidating the debt.  

At the time of preparing this report the two institutions have committed to a land/debt swap for part of the debt.  The exercise is ongoing.  

# National Insurance Property Development and Management Company (NIPRO)  

During the review period there was a change in the Management Structure at NIPRO.  Dr Frederick Isaac completed his contract period and did not seek renewal of his contract.  Mr. Lancelot Arnold was appointed as CEO in February 2005.  The structure of NIPRO was strengthened by the appointment of Mrs. Dorothy Phillips as Manager of Technical Services.  

NIPRO has continued with Management of the construction of a number of Fire and Police Stations under the Build-Own-Lease Transfer (BOLT) arrangement.  The Vieux Fort Police and Firemen moved to their new premises during the year.  

The Management of the NIC and NIPRO are elated as the financial year ended with NIPRO earning its first profit.  

NIPRO continued to pursue its planned maintenance activities for the NIC.  

# St. Lucia Mortgage Finance (SMFC)  

During the year under review SMFC signed two agreements with the National Authorizing Office for EU Operations to provide grant funds of $\$910,000$ .  The Company approved loan applications totaling $\$5.9$ million and disbursed the sum of $\$6.9$ million in respect of seventy six (76) new mortgages completed. This year, as in the previous year, SMFC paid dividends of $5\%$ to its shareholders.  

The SMFC is operating in a very dynamic market and will continue to explore mechanisms for growing its business to ensure continuing value for its Shareholders.  

# Universal Health Care  

The Steering Committee and Secretariat of the Universal Health Care worked earnestly during the year and is pleased to report that a pilot program is expected to commence by mid 2006.  

The eight Committees set up to assist with the implementation are at various stages in meeting their mandate.  

Much work has been undertaken in the following areas:-  

Public Communication  

The UHC undertook a vigorous sensitization campaign in informing the public about the UHC programme.  The team comprising Ms Emma Hippolyte and Dr Stephen King visited ten (10) communities namely: Laborie, Choiseul, Anse La Raye, Micoud, Soufriere, Vieux Fort, Castries, Babonneau, Gros Islet and Canaries.  The discussions have been very lively and interactive and persons have shown keen interest in the programme.  A number of meetings have also been held with key stakeholders viz: the Nurses Association, St. Lucia Medical and Dental Association, the Consumers Association, The Public Service Commission, Members of the Opposition Parties and the St. Lucia Chamber of Commerce.  

The UHC’s website has been established and the public is encouraged to visit the site and provide comments on the programme. The address is www.stluciauhc.org  

In our last Annual Report it was noted that a number of Consultants had been engaged and we are pleased to report that we have received the following reports:-  

1. Human Resource Consultancy which focuses on Human Resource Strategic Plan and a Training Plan for the entire health sector  

2. The Risk Management and Quality Assurance Report – this report has provided the various stakeholders (the five main health providers) a status on the standard of their facilities and has made recommendations on what is required in order to qualify for international accreditation.  

3. Health Information Management and Technology Consultancy – the consultants assessed the information system requirements of the health sector in St. Lucia, and have recommended the necessary systems and procedures to strengthen the system in part, one of a three part report.  

Efforts are in progress to conclude on the structure of UHC and the legislative amendments required for the Governance of the public hospitals.

# Conclusion  

The financial year ended with a sense of achievement in several areas.  Most notable are the strides that have been made with the commencement of the refurbishment of the Blue Coral Building and progress of the UHC program.  

These achievements were realized by a collective team effort and I wish to place on record my appreciation to all those who assisted during the year under review.  To the Government and Prime Minister as Minister responsible for Social Security for his continued support.  To the Board and Members of the Investment Committee for their dedication to duty and their individual input which gave diversity of ideas and thought, and which as a team assisted in building our nation for the betterment of our pensioners.  

My appreciation also to the Management and Staff of the Corporation for their commitment and efficiencies in carrying out the day-to-day activities in the realization of the goals set by the Board.  

On behalf of the Board and Members of the Investment Committee I wish to pledge our unwavering support as we continue “working together with pride to build our nation” for the benefit of us all!  

John C. Joseph Chairman  

# Director ’s Address  

This year, like in years past, the Corporation and its Staff have been engaged in a flurry of projects and activities.  The projects ranged from capital project development to investing in the development of educational software to driving and shaping the UHC Programme.  

The above activities challenged the resolve of the Board, the commitment of the Staff and tested the dexterity and stamina of the Management Team and the various members of civil society that we have co-opted to our numerous Committees and Boards.  

While the Chairman expanded on the Corporation’s investment activities, I will focus on the consolidated financial highlights, special projects and general operational matters.  

This year total Assets grew by 7% from \$820.8m to \$884.1m, an increase of \$63.3m. Last year’s increase was $\mathfrak{G}$  

Contribution income increased this year by 11% from \$56.1m to \$62.8m an increase of \$6.7m.  Last year’s increase was $\mathfrak{C}\mathcal{U}\mathfrak{c}$  

Net Investment Income declined by \$6.0m or 13% from \$51.4m to \$45.3m.  Last year’s increase was 9%.  This decline was occasioned by a net provision for loan impairment of \$6.6m and a regime of low interest rates in the region.  

Administrative expenditure remained unchanged. Benefit expenditure grew by \$3.2m or 10% from \$30.4m to \$33.6m.  

Pension expenditure grew by \$3.0m from \$23.1m to \$26.1m an increase of $4696$ compared to an increase of $\%$ in the previous year, an indication that the fund is reaching maturity.  

Of the \$62.8m of contributions, \$10.2m or 16% was spent on administration, \$33.6m or $\boxed{5}\boxed{4}\boxed{9}$ represented benefit expenditure, \$1.9m or $69\%$ represented donation of equipment to Victoria Hospital and \$17.1m or $p_{U}\mathbf{\mathcal{C}}_{\mathbf{\mathcal{O}}}$ was available for investment.

Chart.1  

Total income increased from \$109.3m to \$109.8m, a slight increase of \$0.5m or $\textcircled{1}\textcircled{6}\textcircled{\div}\%$  

Of the total income of \$109.8m, 10.3m or $\%$ was spent on administration, \$1.9m or $p2\%$ was donated to Health Care, $\boxed{5}\textcircled{:}\boxed{\times}\boxed{\times}$ or \$64.0m was available for investment while \$33.6m or 30.6% represented benefit expenditure.

# Eighth Actuarial Review  

Subsequent to year end, the Corporation received from the ILO its Eighth Actuarial Review of the fund as of 30 June 2003.  

The Executive Summary of the actuarial review is reproduced in this report for completeness. The Board and Management are in the process of reviewing the recommendations.  

We thank the ILO for their support in this critical evaluation.  

# OPERATIONAL MATTERS  

# Human Resources  

The area of Human Resources saw much activity during the year in review.  The number of employees in the organization rose from 97 to 112.  There were several appointments and very few resignations this year.  

The Security Department was strengthened with the appointment of ten new officers in October. These Officers had previously undergone training with the Royal St. Lucia Police Force in areas such as Traffic Management, Cash Escort, Surveillance Techniques and related topics.  

# Retirement  

During the year, Mrs Theodosia Joseph, an Inspector in the Compliance Department retired from the organization.  Mrs Joseph joined the organization in January 1978 as a clerk, and due to her diligence, tenacity and commitment she was promoted to an Inspector in 1986.  She remained in this position until retirement though at different times during her employment she acted as Supervisor of the department and headed special compliance projects which the organization has implemented from time to time.  Mrs Joseph’s quiet but confident ways, her persistence and patience with the difficult employers, the wisdom of her years and knowledge which she imparted freely to her colleagues will be sorely missed.  

# Bereavement  

The Organization suffered its greatest loss when founding staff member Mrs Emelda Elivique passed away on September 9th 2004. At the time of her death, she was the supervisor of the Records Department.  

We mourn Emelda because she was a firm believer in the concept of social security, a hard and dedicated worker, a friend to all who encountered her and had a wealth of knowledge about the National Insurance Corporation.  Some of her experiences are documented in an article written by her in the NIC’s 25th Anniversary magazine – Our Journey.  

# Administrative Trainee Programme  

In March of this year, two officers who came to the organization as Administrative Trainees successfully completed the first year of the programme.  The programme is designed to build the staff capacity by bringing in persons at degree level who would be trained in all departments of the organization under a planned programme to prepare them for middle management positions. The two officers have now joined the Compliance Department as Inspectors in the Vieux Fort and Castries offices respectively.  

# Secondment - Study Leave  

One member of the supervisory staff was seconded to the National Insurance Board of Turks & Cacois.  One other member of staff was granted two years study leave to complete a first a degree in Management Studies at the St. Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago.  

# Human Resource Audit  

For the year under review the organization continued its quest to improve its human capital and engaged the services of the  

Consultant Firm, AB Management and Support Services with the following terms and reference:  

1. To conduct manpower and performance audits to determine the level of utilization and performance of the human resources employed by the NIC, the capabilities and adequacy of skills possessed by staff in meeting NIC’s objectives.   
2. Develop and recommend an organizational structure that is relevant, adequate and cost-effective.   
3. Make recommendations regarding the skills, knowledge and staffing requirements.   
4. Identify and make recommendations  

for improvement on causes of: over/under utilization, excellent/poor performance with particular emphasis on the relationship between management capabilities and performance levels.  

The report has been submitted and the National Insurance is in the process of implementing some of the recommendations.  

# Staffing incentive and motivation  

As part of the organization’s staff incentive and motivation programme, an Employee of the quarter award and a wellness programme were introduced. As a part of the wellness program a number of activities have been implemented:

The organization continued our blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar level tests which have been administered by the St. Lucia Diabetic and Hypertension Association.  

# Public Relations  

The organization kept in close contact with contributors and stakeholders during the year.  

We are pleased to report that the long awaited employee statements were issued this year. Forty thousand (40,000) employees have received statements from the NIC and the exercise continues. The statement contained employee name, address, date of birth, telephone numbers and a list of all the employers with whom the employee worked since the commencement of the National Provident Fund (NPF) and later the National insurance Scheme (NIS) and National Insurance Corporation (NIC).  

These statements, we hope will form a link between us and our contributors keeping them abreast of their status with the National Insurance.  The exercise also provides the organization with the opportunity to clean up the contributors’ database. So far the feedback from the public has been encouraging.  These statements will be issue periodically.  

# PUBLIC EDUCATION  

# General Public  

The National Insurance Corporation believes that public education is the organizations greatest ally. If persons understand the system, they would understand its mission and its raison  d’etre. Over the years, different initiatives have been implemented with varying degrees of success.  

This year, the National Insurance hired a Popular Theatre Group to demonstrate the concept of Social Security in Theatre Style. This production “NIC Sa Zafe’ Nous” – “NIC is our business” has been presented to various communities and has attracted very favourable comments and interest. It has proven to be a very effective vehicle for taking the Social Security message to the self employed especially in the rural communities.  

# Employers  

The Organization realized that some employers were unable to address queries from their employees on matters of National Insurance. These employers were also unaware of the various concepts underpinning the philosophy of social insurance.  To address this, the organization has been holding a series of workshops for employers targeting managers, payroll officers and personnel managers.  Those who have attended the workshops have found it useful having have been exposed inter alia to the principles of Social Insurance, the concept of solidarity and the computation of benefits.  This exercise is ongoing.  

# Teachers  

A one-day seminar was conducted for teachers of social studies in secondary schools in St. Lucia.  The educators were given an overview of the operations of the National Insurance and a general feel and appreciation for the whole concept of social security.  The objectives of two books on social security commissioned by the NIC for Primary and Secondary Schools were also explained to the participants in the hope that they would use these text books in their classroom and expose students to the concept of social security.  

# Contributing to Public Enlightenment  

This year, the organization embarked on a collaborative effort with the University of the West Indies, School of Continuing Education in organizing lectures on matters of national importance.  

In addition the organization initiated the series of panel discussions called “Zafe Nous” – “Our business”.  These panel discussions provide a platform for discussion and input from the public.  The first was in July and the topic “Agriculture and Tourism – Friends or Foes” was well presented by representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Banana Sector and the Tourism Sector.  The discussion that ensued was of a high standard.  Suggestions for addressing some of the problems affecting the sectors were ventilated.  

We were honoured by the attendance of the Governor General to this first discussion.  

# Training  

As a service organization, the National Insurance Corporation is aware of its commitment to its customers and to the public, both internal and external.  To avoid compromising the quality of service it delivers, the Corporation has to ensure that staff at all levels receive and remain exposed to relevant training, so that the viability of its operations is maintained and at the same time enhancing it’s image.  The following are some of the training activities undertaken.  

# Customer Service  

The training, undertaken throughout the year, permeated the organization.  Five front line staff attended a one-day workshop on Customer Service and Public Demands, organized by the St. Lucia Employers’ Federation.  

Safety and Security  

The Security Unit of the Corporation plays a major role in the safety of customers and property. The officers attended a presentation hosted by NIPRO on fire safety, precaution and evacuation techniques.

Some of the other training activities that took place were:  

i) A one-day seminar for secretaries on effective ways of taking minutes ii) Pension Reform iii) Mergers, buyouts and restructuring  

# Special Projects  

# Golden Citizen’s Programme  

The Golden Citizen’s programme launched in  

April 2004 is now entering its 2nd year of existence.  The programme focuses on lightening the financial burden of pensioners. Consequently it provides discounts and special benefits from participating businesses in the private sector.  To date, a total of forty four (44) businesses are in the programme providing a wide range of services from banking and commercial activities to health services.  

The focus now is to get more businesses especially those in the out districts to participate in this venture.  

It is gratifying to see the pride exhibited by persons accessing the programme. It is definitely achieving what it was set up to do – “providing a secure future for St. Lucia’s Golden Citizens”  

# National Community Foundation (NCF)  

The Organization is in the third year of its five year $\$500,000.00$ commitment to the National Community Foundation. So far we are pleased with the impact of the NCF on the social landscape of the country.  

This year the NIC passed on the chairmanship of the NCF to Mr Donovan William, the representative of the Poverty Reduction Fund. The NIC was happy to see the NCF engaging in dialogue with two key sectors that are of concern to the NIC viz Older Persons and Youth at Risk as well as engaging in the Virtues project which has had a positive impact on our young.  Details of these projects follow:-  

Consultation on Older Persons and Youth at Risk  

On January 26th 2005 the NCF met with individuals representing local groups and organizations working with Youth at Risk and Older Persons. Approximately forty six (46) groups and organizations were represented of which 34 were from the Youth at Risk Sector.  

The Consultation provided the NCF with the perfect forum to inform the participants about its functions and operations as well as its level of commitment to Youth at Risk and Older Persons.  

# 2005 Telethon  

The NCF’s biggest fundraising event, the 2005 NCF Telethon was held at the Pigeon Island National Landmark on Sunday 3rd April.  The total amount collected from the Telethon was approximately $\$12,000,00$ .  Some individuals and companies pledged financial commitments for periods from three years to an indefinite period.  

# The Virtues Project  

The Brian Bernard Memorial Fund, a Donor Advised Fund administered by the National Community Foundation, was established in memory of the late Commissioner of Police.  

The fund focuses on promoting and enhancing ethical behaviour, human and spiritual values.  

This it does by inspiring individuals and institutions to act ethically towards one another through Education, Advocacy and Research by way of the Virtues Project.  

The NCF has embarked on a programme aimed at training persons who are directly involved in educating youth in the Virtues programme.  The programme is intended to provide empowering strategies that inspire the practice of virtues in everyday life, including the classroom.  In light of this, the Foundation organized a five-day intensive training programme from July 11 – 15, 2005 for fifteen staff members of the George Charles Secondary School which was facilitated by Ms Lynda Brooke, a qualified facilitator from Virtues International.  

The training of educators under the Virtues project continues.  

We salute the individuals and Corporations that have joined hands with us in making the work of the NCF a reality.  

# Conclusion

# Eighth Actuarial Review of the National Insurance Fund as of 30 June 2003  

![](images/58d5a379f1ce422a6202bb4f55c560b8737960b22e4f968ee6af7f574b76fd40.jpg)  

# Executive summary  

Some of the benefits that current National Insurance contributors anticipate receiving will be paid more than fifty years from today. Therefore, to determine whether or not St. Lucia’s social security system is sustainable over the long-term, actuarial reviews are conducted every three years. In these reviews an examination of the National Insurance Fund’s (NIF) current and projected future financial status is made. The actuary is also expected to recommend steps that may be taken to help ensure that the scheme remains solvent for future generations, while providing meaningful benefits to current workers and pensioners.  

During its first twenty-five years, the National Insurance Corporation (NIC) has experienced steady growth in contribution and investment income, benefit expenditure and reserves. However, over the past five years, the number of contributors has remained at around 40,000 while the number of pensioners has increased by almost 40 per cent from 2,600 in 1999 to 3,600 in 2003. At the end of the 2003 financial year, National Insurance reserves stood at EC\$737 million or 21 times total expenditure in 2002-2003. Relative to the economy, total reserves were 39 per cent of GDP. While this is a relatively high level of funding, total assets are less than the present value of total benefits already earned by past and present contributors, a position consistent with the design and financing method adopted for most social security pension systems.  

During the past several years, several reforms aimed at enhancing the financial sustainability of the NIF have been made. These changes came out of recommendations made in the Sixth Actuarial Review and included gradual increases to the normal pension age and the qualifying number of contributions required for a Retirement pension. While the Board and Government are to be complimented for the proactive measures aimed at strengthening St. Lucia’s social security system financially, emphasis on securing long-term finances appears to have resulted in a potential reduction in benefits given that some pension qualifying conditions may be considered overly restrictive.  

With birth rates declining and increased longevity among the elderly, future National Insurance finances will show a different pattern from those of its first twenty-five years. While reserves are expected to continue growing for some time, the consequences of a declining contributor-pensioner ratio and a contribution rate that is below the true cost of all benefits will gradually emerge as the scheme matures. Along with a review of the NIF’s financial position as of 30 June 2003, this report includes projections of income, expenditure and reserves through 2063. The following charts illustrate the projected trend for NIC reserves along with contribution and projected expenditure rates assuming that the contribution rate and benefit provisions remain unchanged.  

The key results of the financial and demographic projections based on the  

# Summary Actuary  

contribution and benefit provisions in place as of valuation date1 are:  

The population will increase from 158,000 in 2001 to just over 210,000 by 2063.  

The ageing of the general population will have a major impact on the ratio of workers to retirees. For National Insurance, it is projected that the number of contributors for each pensioner will fall from 11.0 in 2003 to only 2.2 in 2063.  

Contribution income is expected to be sufficient to meet total expenditure through 2023.

Chart ES.2. Contribution and expenditure rates, 2003 -2063  

Reserves are expected to begin decreasing in 2048 when total expenditure will exceed total income for the first time. In 2062, projected reserves will be depleted.  

The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) rate, or the contribution rate that would be required to produce just enough income to meet expenditure if there is no Fund, will increase gradually from 6.9 per cent in 2003 to 22.2 per cent in 2063.  

Beginning in 2003, 13.1 per cent is the constant contribution rate that will make the present value of contributions equal to the present value of expenditure through 2063.  

The projection results described above show a marked improvement in long-term finances when compared with the Seventh Actuarial Review, which projected Fund depletion in 2034. The main reasons for the significant change in the year that the Fund is projected

# Summary of Report  

![](images/1bb60b3935e9904f5b8087305538ddef8c0a79ddc5e384e29abdaab6a29c514c.jpg)  

to be depleted are the increases being made to the normal pension age, the higher number of contributions required for Retirement pension and the reduction in the maximum pension from 65 per cent to 60 per cent of average insurable wages.  

With a projection period of sixty years, there is some uncertainty that actual experience will be either better or worse than projected. There are many economic and demographic factors that will influence future income and expenditure. So too will changes to rules governing contributions and benefits also affect actual finances. However, with Fund depletion not expected for almost sixty years, variances between assumptions and actual experience that result in more or less favourable estimates of when deficits will begin and when the Fund will be depleted are not likely to have a material difference on the conclusions and recommendations made in this report.  

The implications of a projected depletion of reserves and future contribution rates that could possibly be in excess of 22 per cent should not be ignored. But the primary challenges facing the NIC at this time are the relatively low coverage of the working population (due mainly to the exclusion of civil servants and low compliance rates among self-employed persons), stringent pension qualifying conditions that appear to be limiting the number of persons being awarded pensions and income replacement rates that may be giving undue privilege to those just barely meeting the minimum qualifying conditions. No recommendation is being made to adjust the contribution rate at this time. Instead, most of the recommendations made throughout this report, and summarised below, focus primarily on ensuring adequate coverage, benefit adequacy and equity and maintaining pension relevance.  

# Recommendations  

(1) Wage ceiling increases should occur annually in line with changes in average wages with the rules governing such increases placed in Regulations. To estimate changes in average national wages, a national wage index should be created by the government’s Statistics Department. Until such an index is available, national insurance data may be used as a proxy. (Section 4.1)  

(2) An across-the-board increase to pensionsin-payment ranging from 2 per cent to 12 per cent, depending on the year the pension was awarded, should be granted. Lump-sum grants, maternity and funeral grants and the minimum pension rate should also be increased. Thereafter, pensions-in-payment and set benefit rates should be automatically adjusted annually in line with average inflation over the previous three years, with the rules that govern the timing and the amount of each adjustment placed in Regulations. (Section 4.1)  

(3) Review the age at which a surviving spouse may receive a pension for more than one year. This age was recently increased from 55 to pensionable age. (Section 4.3)  

(4) If the change that is presently being considered in the Retirement pension formula to one that uses earnings over one’s career is not implemented, then pension accrual rates should be revised so that pensions accrue more gradually instead of the current higher payment rate (40 per cent) for those who meet the minimum contribution requirement (now 144 months). Also, consideration should be given to reducing the number of months required to qualify for a pension to 120 but with a 25 per cent or 30 per cent pension rate instead of 40 per cent. These latter changes will result in fewer grants and more pensions and thus enhanced security among the elderly population. (Section 4.4)  

(5) Review the formula used to determine Retirement and Invalidity grants to account for both employee and employer contributions and accrued interest. Presently, only $50\%$ of total NIC contributions paid without interest is refunded. Based on the contribution histories of recent awards, a suitable formula could be devised. (Section 4.5)  

(6) Government should seek advice on ways of incorporating all civil servants into NIC coverage, and of coordinating the payment of pensions of the two groups. While the recent inclusion of persons who joined the public service after January 2003 was a positive step, gaps in pension coverage still exist as some public officers may not qualify for a pension when they leave the service. (Section 4.6)  

(7) The Board should seek to significantly improve the level of participation among the self-employed by firstly making NIC self-employed coverage mandatory. In addition, efforts at increasing education on the importance of compliance among this group, creating linkages with government departments that issue permits and/or licenses to self-employed persons, and developing a simplified approach to the way self-employed persons are required to contribute should be considered. (Section 4.7)  

(8) For investments, the Board should continue to gradually place additional funds outside of St. Lucia with a medium-term target of having 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the portfolio in regional and international investments. For local investments, a prudent asset mix, as provided for in the Fund’s Investment Policy, should be maintained. (Section 1.4)  

Among regional social security systems, the St. Lucia National Insurance Fund is one of the best funded and best prepared to meet the increasing costs of an ageing population and maturing pension system. However, the proportion of the working population covered is lower than that of most other systems and some pension

qualifying conditions are among the most stringent. In the coming years, therefore, in addition to increasing compliance among the self-employed, emphasis should be placed on achieving a suitable balance between strong finances and equitable and relevant benefits. For Retirement pensions, this could possibly be achieved by providing for the payment of slightly less generous Retirement pensions to more elderly insured persons. The ILO supports plans by Government to enhance the overall level of social protection offered through an unemployment benefit, a social health insurance and a pension system geared towards farmers and fishers (the subject of separate ILO studies). These additional programmes, together with socially relevant and financially sustainable national pensions, should enhance the socio-economic well-being of all St. Lucians for generations to come.

# 2. CONTRIBUTION INCOME  

The financing of the National Insurance Corporation is based on a combined contribution rate of 10.0 percent (5.0 percent employees and 5.0 percent employers) of insurable earnings. During the review period, the ceiling upon which contributions are based was not revised and thus kept at $\$5,000,00$ per month.  

During the fiscal year ended June 2005, National Insurance Corporation’s contribution income increased by $11.23\%$ to $\$62.58M$ ; current contributions accounted for $51.49\%$ or $\$32.22M$ and arrears (past-due contributions accounted for $48.51\%$ or $\$30.36M$ . Contribution income in the review period was collected from 2,732 employers on behalf of approximately 41,040 active contributors. The increase in contribution income was in part the collective impact of the following performances:  

1. $2.29\%$ increase in the active insured population;  

2. 3,466 new contributors or new entrants were recorded in the review period- this performance equated to growth of $9\%$ .  

3. Continued improvement in the collection of past-due contribution income;  

4. $4.55\%$ increase in contributing employers;  

5. $3.54\%$ increase in active contributors average insurable earnings;   
6. Active contributors average number of months of employment during the review period increased by $2.41\%$ to 9.36;   
7. $13.93\%$ growth in current contribution income.  

![](images/89e7d223c4148e894d62e9c04169bbb72d334dd26ad09271b5f4773d1dc4e70f.jpg)  
Graph: 1  

During the fiscal period in review, current contribution income increased by $\$3.94M$ $(13.93\%)$ to $\$32.22M$ (see graph 2). Collectively, growth in new entrants and active insured population, increase in average insurable earnings and further rise in contribution density have resulted in corresponding growth of expected contributions. Expected contributions for the financial year in review amounted to $\$63,09M$ and were $10.86\%$ higher than the previous year. Consequently, if related variables remain constant there would be a natural increase in current contribution income due to larger expected contributions. $51.06\%$ of expected contributions were collected within the required time compared to $49.13\%$ in the previous fiscal year; this represents an improved performance of $1.92\%$ or $\$121M$ . Further, eight months out of the twelve months period, July 2004 - June 2005, current contribution income accounted for over $50\%$ of expected contributions.

After recording a $16\%$ increase in 2003-2004, past-due contribution income during the financial year in review recorded further growth of $8.51\%$ . Whilst $\$24.88M$ or $81.95\%$ of arrears collected were in respect of the review period (July 2004 – June 2005), $\$5.48M$ or $18.05\%$ were in respect of periods prior to July 2004. Additionally, examination of related data indicated that approximately $90.51\%$ of expected contributions were collected during the financial year in review. When compared to the previous fiscal year  (July 2003 – June  

2004), the above performance was a contraction of $2.04\%$ . As at 30 June 2005, total past due contributions (arrears) stood at $\$46.70M$ ; of this amount, arrears for the financial year ended June 2005 accounted for $12.82\%$ or approximately $\$6.01$ .  

Whilst the performance of the National Insurance Corporation regarding collection of both current and past-due contributions surpassed that for the previous fiscal year, the need for further improvement cannot be overstated.  

Distribution of contribution income on the basis of industrial classification showed increases in contributions from all sectors of the economy. Given that the contribution ceiling remained at $\$5,000.00$ per month, the above performance was the best in the last 13 years. As expected, contribution income from the construction and mining/quarrying sectors recorded their highest increase of $42.0\%$ . Not withstanding significant contractions in the agriculture sector, contribution income in the review period experienced a further increase of $12.40\%$ . After recording a $10.11\%$ growth in 2003-2004, contributions received from the hotel/restaurant industry grew by $4.93\%$ and maintained its largest share $(20\%)$ of contribution income. Growths recorded from the other industrial sectors are outlined below:  

1. Manufacturing $-5.33\%$ ;   
2. Electricity, Gas and Water Supply – $.0.32\%$ ;   
3. Wholesale and Retail $-16.64\%$ ;   
4. Transport, Storage and Communication – $11.50\%$ ;   
5. Financial Intermediations- $12.68\%$ ;   
6. Real Estate, Renting and Business services- $18.60\%$ ;   
7. Public Administration and Defense, Compulsory Social Security, Education, Health and Social work- $23.79\%$ ;   
8. Community, Social/Personal Services, Households with Employed Persons and Extra-territorial Organizations and Bodies- $8.78\%$ .

# 2. INSURED POPULATION  

In general, the future course of the National Insurance retirement pension program is determined to a large extent by the demographic characteristics of its insured population and national long-term economic performance. At any given point in time the insured population would include active contributors (paid employees, self-employed and voluntary contributors) and in-active contributors (in-active insured persons).  

As at June 2005, the insured population was estimated at 102,663 $53.77\%$ were males and $46.23\%$ were females). During the period, July 1979 – June 2004, the insured population initially grew at the rate of $4\%$ and gradually reduced to $2\%$ at the end of the financial year in review. An age distribution of the insured population showed that $2\%$ are under 20 years, $71\%$ are approximately uniformly distributed between the ages of $20-45$ years and $27\%$ are over 45 years. In addition, the insured population is characterized by a mean age of 39.19 years.  

# 2.10 Active Insured  

The active insured population comprises the following categories of contributors:  

a. New entrants (first-time contributors) and   
b. Insured persons who were employed and paid at least one-month contribution in the review period.  

The size and composition of active insured population are directly related to economic performances. Positive economic growth is likely to stimulate employment that may result in corresponding expansion of the active insured population. Similarly, contraction in the economy is likely to impact negatively on the rate of employment and consequently NIC’s active contributors. Following a $1.39\%$ increase in the previous year, active contributor population in the review period grew by $3.79\%$ to 41,247; males accounted for $49.09\%$ or 20,274 and females accounted for $50.91\%$ or 20,973. The trend of active contributors is shown in figure 4.

Figure 4.  

Distribution of active insured persons on the basis of age, points toward a relatively young population: $25\%$ are less than 25 years, $45\%$ are between 25- 39 years, $20\%$ are between 40-49 years and $10\%$ are over 50 years. During the past 15 years (July 1990 – June 2005), the mean age of active contributors grew at an average rate of $0.67\%$ per fiscal year, from 31.29 years in 1990-1991 to 34.03 years at the end of June 2005 (see graph 5).  

![](images/f7270e293c981d199d91695541bc24b87df42841125231ab0c5f10c70fec4dc2.jpg)  
Graph: 5  

During the period July 2000 - June 2005, distribution of active contributors on the basis of industrial classification showed significant improvement over the previous fiscal year. In spite of further contraction of $2.04\%$ in employment from the agriculture sector, the intensity of contraction was less pronounced when compared to an average rate of declined of $12.0\%$ per annum experienced during the past three years.  

Employment in the construction industry recorded the highest growth rate of $36.49\%$ . Impact of this very significant performance on the mining and quarrying sector resulted in a corresponding $10.47\%$ rise in employment. Other sectors which recorded significant growth in employment were: transport/storage/communication- $11.79\%$ , restaurants and hotels- $10.70\%$ and community/social services: $11.75\%$ . Moderate increases were also realized from the following sectors: public administration- $6.16\%$ , financial services- $5.64\%$ and wholesale and retail trade- $2.67\%$ .  

Notwithstanding the above performances, employment in the Realestate/Renting/Business Services sector contracted by $2.28\%$ . Declines in employment were also recorded in the Utility sector of $2.40\%$ . The manufacturing sector has experienced its sixth consecutive decline from 4,388 in July 1999-June 2000 to 3,152 in the review period- an overall contraction of $28.17\%$ . Employment trends in the manufacturing sector are illustrated in figure 6.  

Further analysis indicated that collectively, the four economic sectors that recorded declines in active contributors of $8.73\%$ in July 2004- June 2005 also experienced a $26.65\%$ drop in employment during the previous financial year. The fact is, a very large reduction in the rate of contraction of employment in these sectors was recorded in the review period. The level of growth of active contributors (employment) on the basis of economic sector for the period July 2003-June 2005 is illustrated in figure 7.

# 2.11 New entrants  

A total of 3,466 new contributors (first-time contributors) were recorded during the period July 2004- June 2005, an increase of 9%from the previous year. Of this number, 1,709 were males and 1,757 were females. Examination of new entrants on the basis of economic sector showed that the recorded increase was principally due to significant growth in the following sectors:  

Community, Social and Personal Services- $53\%$ ;   
Transport, Storage and   
Communication- $45\%$ ;   
Construction- $42\%$   
Hotels and Restaurants- $23\%$ Agriculture- $10\%$   
Wholesale and Retail Trade- $8\%$  

During the review period, contribution income from new entrants amounted to $\$1210$ and accounted for $3.36\%$ of total contributions collected. The major economic sectors, which accounted for employment were wholesale and retail trade- $25\%$ , restaurants and hotels$18\%$ , government/public service- $11\%$ , transport/storage/communication- $10\%$ and construction/manufacturing- $16\%$ .

# 2.12 Self-Employed  

As at 30th June 2005, NIC’s self employed population increased by $5.16\%$ to 2,978. Of this number 907 or $30.46\%$ were active or paid at least one-month contribution to the NIC in the review period. Figure 9 shows moderate growth in the proportion of self-employed who paid contributions during the period July 2000 June 2004 whilst, contraction of $7.26\%$ were recorded in July 2004-June 2005. In effect, $69.54\%$ of self-employed do not honor their commitment to submit the relevant contributions that could eventually entitled them to a retirement pension, which is in fact the primary objective.  The level of compliance of self-employed continues to be a major concern to the NIC.  

# Graph: 9 2.12 Voluntary Contributors  

![](images/b7f71a61c92ac86452fd7ecb0db601df42a2ab6bc944888c6ca61621dce6e9df.jpg)  

At the end of June 2005, 950 voluntary contributors were registered with the NIC. Of this number 272 or $28.63\%$ paid contributions totaling approximately $\$97,000$ . The above is certainly a strong indication that the level of compliance regarding payment of contributions is in immediate need of an effective monitoring mechanism. During the review period 71 voluntary contributors were registered, a decline of $19.32\%$ when compared to the previous financial year. Graph 10 shows the growth of voluntary persons during the period 1994-2005.

# 3. EMPLOYERS’ ACTIVITIES  

As at 30th June 2005, a total of 8,017 employers were registered with the National Insurance Corporation. The above number comprised of 3,307 or $41.25\%$ active employers, 4,609 or $57.49\%$ were closed and 101 or $1.26\%$ were dormant. Active employers population grew by a further $2\%$ while 271 employers were recorded as closed during the review period. The above number of employers who ceased operation represented a $13.69\%$ drop from the previous year.  

During the financial year in review, employers who paid contributions to the NIC on behalf of active contributors increased by $4.55\%$ to 2,732. Analysis of contributing employers for the last five years (July 2000 - June 2005) revealed mixed performances. Using July 2000-June 2001 as base year, contributing employers’ recorded average annual declines of $3\%$ during the period July 2001–June 2004.  

Similar comparison for the fiscal year ended June 2005 revealed an increase of $2.89\%$ . Figure 11 illustrate the distribution of contributing employers for the period 2000- 2005.

Graph: 11  

During the fiscal periods July 2001 – June 2004, approximately $81\%$ of active employers paid contributions to the NIC. As indicated in the 2003-2004 NIC annual report, development of new strategies to improve compliance in the payment of contributions by employers, gradual improvement in the economy and projected positive growth would provide the basis for anticipated progress in employers’ level of compliance. In the review period, active employers who paid contributions increased by approximately $2.42\%$ to $83.42\%$ . Table 1 illustrates the distribution of contributing employers on the basis of industrial classification for the period July 2004 – June 2005.

During the fiscal year July 2004-June 2005, distribution of contributing employers on the basis of economic sector showed considerable growth in all sectors except agriculture. Mining/quarrying, utility, financial intermediation, real-estate/business service and social service sectors recorded an average increase of over $10\%$ . Contributing employer from the other sectors such as manufacturing, construction, wholesale/retail trade, restaurant/hotel, transport/communication and public administration also recorded moderate growth of $6.5\%$ .

Graph: 12  

A total of 432 employers registered with the National Insurance Corporation in the review period.  When compared to the previous fiscal year, it was a $32.92\%$ increase. Figure 12 above shows the trend of employers who registered during the last ten years (July 1995 – June 2005). Distribution of newly registered employers on the basis of economic sector revealed major increases in most sectors whilst declines were also observed in a few industries. The agriculture, manufacturing and transport/storage/communication sectors recorded increases of over $82\%$ .  The following economic sectors also experienced relatively large increase in the number of new employers:  

a. Community/Social/Personal Services, Households with Employed Persons, Extra-territorial Organizations and Bodies – 50.55%   
b. Public Administration- $41.22\%$   
c. Restaurants and Hotels – 47.22%   
d. Real-estate, Renting and Business Services – $13.04\%$   
e. Construction – 57.89%  

# 4. NIC BENEFITS EXPENDITURE  

The Corporation offers its contributors a benefit basket comprising of two main branches, namely short-term and long-term benefits.  

During the periods 1999 – 2004, rate of growth of total benefits expenditure declined from $8.75\%$ in July 1999-June 2000 to $6.08\%$ in July 2003 – June 2004. However, in the review period (July 2004 – June 2005), a total of 12,455 claims (pensions, grants and shortterm claims) were paid at a cost of $\$33,49M$ . When compared to the previous fiscal year, claims paid increased by $3.71\%$ whilst total benefits expenditure rose by approximately $\$3.34M$ or $11\%$ . The above expansion in benefits expenditure was mainly due to significant increase in the number of pensions awarded and increase in the average cost of short-term benefits claims paid.

Graph: 13  

# 4.1 Short Term Benefits:  

Short-term benefits offered by the National Insurance Corporation include employment injury, funeral grant, maternity allowance, maternity grant, medical expenses and sickness allowance.  

In July 2004-June 2005, 7,785 short-term claims were paid at a cost of $\$70M$ . The number of claims paid dropped marginally by $0.57\%$ whilst cost of short-term benefits recorded a $6.45\%$ increase over the previous year. The overall contraction in short-term claims was solely due to corresponding declines in sickness allowances; all other short-term benefit recorded moderate growths.  

# 4.1 Sicknes Benefit:  

In the review period, sickness benefits claims paid declined by $2.36\%$ to 5,853. Notwithstanding the drop in claims, cost of sickness allowances increased by $11.95\%$ to $\$2.03M$ . The rise in sickness allowances expenditure was the combined effect of the following:  

$3.04\%$ increase in average duration of claims paid; Impact of growth in average insurable earnings on average cost per claim, which increased by $13.83\%$ to $\$352.59$ .  

![](images/0a955cdd372a85370591dee79b810336cc96f58a5c3c67ec908c45f42b35f0a4.jpg)

Employment Injury claims paid during the 2004-2005 fiscal year increased from 81 to 100- an increase of $23.46\%$ . As has always been the case, males continue to be the predominant claimant for employment injury, accounting for $83\%$ of claims. Cost of employment injury claims paid grew by $21\%$ to the second highest amount in the last five years of $\$85,114$ .  

# 4.13MaternityBenefits  

The maternity benefit covers two sub-benefits; these include the maternity allowance and maternity grant. The maternity benefit is a benefit, which is generally influenced by the NIC female insured population and demographic issue of fertility and birth rate. Over the past 10 years the number of maternity allowances as well as the associated cost have had an average decline of $6.02\%$ during the four fiscal years ended 2004.  In 2004-2005, the number of maternity allowances increased for the first time since 1999. There was an increase of $5.44\%$ in the number of allowances with an accompanied rise of $9.27\%$ in expenditure $(\$1.69M)$ .  

In the review period, maternity grants awarded by the NIC also recorded growth; there was an increase of less than one percent (7 Claims) in the number of grants paid. This marginal growth in maternity grants awarded led to a corresponding increase of $0.88\%$ in the cost of grant from $\$479,400$ to $\$483,600$ .  

# 4.14FuneralGrant  

A total of 191 funeral grants were awarded at a cost of $\$330,821$ . The number of funeral grants awarded increased by $6.7\%$ . As expected in most instances, increase in funeral grants would impact on other benefits such as retirement pensions and survivors benefit/pensions. During the past four years, it was observed that the number of persons over the pensionable age who die actually accounted for increasing proportion of funeral grants. In 2001-2002, the proportion of prepensionable aged and post-pensionable aged deceased stood at 57:43; in 2004-2005, this proportion was 45:56. The later proportion is associated with an overall decline in children’ pensions and an increase in widow/widower’ pension which is also the most costly within survivors pension.

Graph: 15  

# 4.2 Long Term Benefits:  

Part of the NIC’s basket of benefits is the longterm benefit branch, which includes Disablement Pension, Invalidity Pension, Retirement Pension, Survivor’s Pension, Disablement Grant, Invalidity Grant, Retirement Grant and Survivor’s Grant. These together make up the majority of the benefits expenditure.  

During the year in review, a total of 4,478 longterm claims were paid at a cost of $\$26,02M$ . Cost of long-term benefit branch continues to rise steadily. Following steady declines in the rate of growth from $18\%$ in 1999-2000 to $7\%$ in 2003-2004, long-term benefit expenditure grew by $12.43\%$ in the review period. With the continued shift from a grant/allowance program to mainly a pension scheme, the proportion of long-term benefits expenditure to total benefits cost stood at $76.70\%$ , an indication that the scheme is approaching maturity.  

# Graph: 16 4.21NICpensions  

The pensions offered by the national Insurance Corporation Include retirement, survivors, invalidity and disablement. Collectively, during the financial year ended June 2005, the number of pensions paid rose by $9.72\%$ to 4,300; cost of pensions also increased by $10.67\%$ or $\$2.42M$ to $\$25,41M$ .  

![](images/a55270ed8ebfc5fc1b600fbc52c546104b29fe2e592461f720d4306ad59b1224.jpg)  

Generally, there has been an overall contraction in the growth of pension cost. After recording a $7.40\%$ increase in 2003-2004, significant growth in pensions awarded contributed towards a $10.67\%$ increase in the review period.  During the financial year July 2004-June 2005, 205 pensions were terminated; of this number, retirement pensions accounted for $46.83\%$ . At the end of June 2005, 4,022 pensions were in-payment: $71.69\%$ or 2,843 were retirement pensions, $22.23\%$ or 894 were survivors pensions, $6.94\%$ or 279 were invalidity pensions and $0.15\%$ or 6 were disablement pensions.

We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of National Insurance Corporation (the “Group”) and its subsidiaries as at June 30, 2005 and the consolidated statements of changes in reserves, income and expenditure and cash flows for the year then ended.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Group’s directors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept responsibility to anyone other than the Group and the Group’s directors as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of National Insurance Corporation.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.  Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. As disclosed in Notes 2(c) and (e) these financial statements do not include:-  

(i) contributions due to National  

Insurance Corporation which had not been received as at June 30, 2005; (ii) surcharges on contributions in arrears which have been levied but which remained uncollected as at June 30, 2005;  

In our opinion, except for the policy to record contributions and surcharges on a cash basis and omit those due but not received as at June 30, 2005, these financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as at June 30, 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

# NATIONAL INSURANCE CORPORATION Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 2005

Its registered office is located at 1st Floor, Francis Compton Building, John Compton Highway, Castries, St. Lucia.

The principal activity of the company is to operate a mortgage finance company.  

National Insurance Property Management and Development Company Ltd.  

The company is currently engaged in the development and management of the Government of St. Lucia Build-Own-Lease-Transfer (BOLT) and refurbishment projects.

2. Adoption of revised International Financial Reporting Standards  

In the current year the Group has adopted the revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (the IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are relevant to its operations. The adoption of these revised Standards and Interpretations has resulted in changes to the Group’s accounting policies in the following areas:  

Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation (IAS32)  

Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS39)  

![](images/07c33c55f224cc39d627eb5396c6d135f210be039a561838efa0b0fd28082a95.jpg)

2. Adoption of revised International Financial Reporting Standards(cont’d)  

IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation  

The impact of this standard has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements in relation to the Group’s financial assets.  

# IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement  

IAS 39 requires that financial assets are valued at fair market value. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of the provision for loan impairment. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the provision for loan impairment in the Statement of Income and Expenditure.  

For 2005, the impact is a net increase to income of $\$2,986,707$ .  The change has had no material impact on amounts reported for 2004 or prior periods.  

3. Significant Accounting Policies  

(a) Overall Policy  

The Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.  

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and investment properties. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to use accounting estimates and to exercise its’ judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.  

# (b) Basis of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Group and entities controlled by the Group (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved  where the Group has power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.  

# 3. Significant Accounting Policies (Cont’d)  

Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Intra-group transactions, balances, income, expenses and unrealized gains are eliminated on consolidation  

Minority interest represents that part of the net results of subsidiaries attributable to interests which are not owned directly or indirectly by the parent entity, after making adjustments for unrealised profits and losses of subsidiaries and other adjustments necessary to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.  

# (c) Contributions  

Contributions reflect only amounts received from members and do not include contributions due to National Insurance Corporation, which had not been received as at June 30, 2005.  

# (d) Benefits  

Benefits include amounts paid, and claims reported but not paid.  Benefits are classified into two funds; long-term benefits and short-term benefits.  

(e) Surcharges  

Surcharges include amounts received from members, but exclude surcharges levied but uncollected as at June 30, 2005.  

(f) Basis of Allocation of Income  

Contribution Income  

Contribution income, as recommended by the seventh actuarial review, is allocated as follows:

# 3. Significant Accounting Policies (Cont’d)  

Investment Income  

Investment income less expenses is allocated to the benefit fund in the ratio of the beginning of year reserve of each fund to the total beginning of year reserves.  

Investment expenses comprise all costs relating to the management of investment properties and investment securities and provisions for diminution in the value investments.  

Other Income  

Other income is allocated in the same proportions as contribution income.  

(g) Interest Income and Expense  

Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all interest bearing instruments at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate method is the method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.  

When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but does not consider future credit losses.  

Once a financial asset or group of financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring impairment loss.  

(h) Dividend Income  

Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recorded in the Statement of Income and Expenditure when the entities right to receive the payment is established.  

(i) Development Fees  

Development fees are included in the project cost and are recognized as income over the lives of the projects on a pro rata basis.  

3. Significant Accounting Policies (Cont’d)  

(j) Management Fees  

Management fees are recognised as income over the lives of projects on a pro rata basis.  

(k) Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents are carried on the balance sheet at cost. For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition including: cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks and bank overdrafts.  

(l) Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable and other receivables are carried at original carrying amount less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of accounts receivable is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.  

The amount of the provisions is the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the Income and Expenditure Statement.  

# (m) Finance Lease  

The asset held as a finance lease is recognised as a receivable and finance income is based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance lease.  

(n) Financial Assets  

The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:  

Loans and Advances Held-to-Maturity Investments and Available-for-sale financial assets.  

![](images/d7b0c89d5596a29f9f096c647bec923d35806451d4efd54320f5dfbca84d8e3e.jpg)

# 3. Significant Accounting Policies (Cont’d)  

Management determines the classifications of its investments at initial recognition and revaluates this designation at every reporting date.  

# Loans and Advances  

All loans are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  

# Held-to-Maturity  

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and  fixed maturities that the Group’s management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Were the Group to sell other than an insignificant amount of the held to maturity assets, the entire category would be tainted and reclassified as available-for-sale.  

# Available-for-Sale  

Available-for-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rate, exchange rate or equity prices.  

Purchases and sales of financial assets held-to-maturity and available-for-sale are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.  

Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction cost. Financial assets are derecognised when rights to receive cash flows from financial assets have expired or when the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.  

Available-for-sale assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and advances and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for sale financial assets are included in the Statement of Income and Expenditure in the period in which they arise.  

# 3. Significant Accounting Policies (Cont’d)  

The fair values of quoted instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active, the Group established fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.  

# (o) Impairment of Financial Assets  

The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired if there is objective evidence that the loss has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and has an impact on the ability of management to reliably estimate future cash flows of the financial asset or group of assets.  

The Group assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not significant.  

Impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence that impairment loss on heldto-maturity investments carried at amortised cost has been incurred or that the Group wil not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loans. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the recoverable amount being the present value of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses which have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective rate.  

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of the provision for loan impairment. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the provision for loan impairment in the Statement of Income and Expenditure.  

The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.  

The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial assets carried at fair value is impaired. Where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost, management determines whether

# 3. Significant Accounting Policies (Cont’d)  

the assets are impaired.  

# (p) Investment Properties  

Investment properties principally comprising office buildings are held for long-term rental yields. Investment properties are treated as long-term investments and are carried at fair values, representing open market values determined annually by external valuers. Changes in fair values are recorded in the Statement of Income and Expenditure in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.  

# (q) Property, Plant and Equipment  

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis, so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows: -  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Buildings</td><td>50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold improvements</td><td>2 - 10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>3 - 5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and equipment</td><td>4 - 10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computer hardware</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computer software</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Generators</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance equipment</td><td>10 years</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The asset residual value and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Statement of Income and Expenditure.  

(r) Projects in Progress  

Build-Own-Lease-Transfer (BOLT) Projects  

# 3. Significant Accounting Policies (Cont’d)  

These include all costs associated with the construction and furnishing of the buildings. Direct costs of construction are recognized when an interim valuation is done.  On completion, they are accounted for as finance leases.  

(s) Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities  

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate.  

(t) Income Tax  

As per Cabinet conclusions, the following exemptions have been granted to the subsidiary companies: -  

St. Lucia Mortgage Finance Company Limited is exempt from income tax on any income accruing to the company by way of interest on loans up to $\$300,000$ .  

National Insurance Property Development and Management Company Ltd. is exempt from income tax on the profits earned by the company, which are specific to the refurbishment and BOLT projects.  

Castries Car Park Facility Ltd. has been granted a tax holiday for the first ten years of operation.  

Blue Coral Ltd. has been granted a tax holiday for the first ten years of operation.  

Income taxes, where applicable, are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method whereby:  

current and deferred tax is recognised as income or expense except to the extent that the tax relates to equity items;   
a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to realise the asset;   
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability settled.

# 3. Significant Accounting Policies (Cont’d)  

(u) Foreign Currencies  

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Eastern Caribbean dollars which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates (its functional currency).  

Assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  Transactions arising during the year involving foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency and recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.  Differences arising from fluctuations in exchange rates as well as including differences between buying and selling rates, are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Expenditure.  

# (v) Comparative Figures  

Where necessary comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the current year.

# 15. Actuarial Review  

Section 24 (1) of the Act requires an actuarial review of the National Insurance Fund at five-year intervals.  

The Seventh Actuarial Review of the National Insurance Fund as at June 2000, conducted by an actuary of the International Labour Organisation, concluded that the Fund was financially sound.  

![](images/3b4e42ddb10f82f4f836f76d0f4d84909e18ebb90df9440ae9f74465b082b32d.jpg)

# 15. Actuarial Review (cont’d)  

Contribution payments and benefit calculations are based on insurable earning levels. The contribution amount is paid by the employer and the employee in equal proportions.  

Benefits are classified into two Funds; long-term benefits and short-term benefits.  Each Fund is credited with contribution and investment income from which benefit expenditure and administrative expenses are met.  

Following are some recommendations made by the Actuary in the Seventh Actuarial Review:- Change the present system of basing contribution and benefit provisions on calendar months to weeks. Consider the use of average earnings over one’s entire career as the basis for calculating age pensions.   
The Eighth Actuarial Review of the National Insurance Fund as at June 2003, is now   
completed at June 30, 2005.  

# 16. Financial Risk Management  

In accordance with the provisions of International Accounting Standard No. 32, disclosure is required regarding credit risk, interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk and fair value amounts of financial assets and liabilities.  

# (a) Credit Risk  

Credit assets which potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, mortgage and other loans, accounts receivable and investments.  

Cash equivalents and fixed deposits are placed with high quality financial institutions. Mortgage and other loans are presented net of the vis loan impairment.  Credit risk with respect to mortgage loans to customers is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the customer base.
