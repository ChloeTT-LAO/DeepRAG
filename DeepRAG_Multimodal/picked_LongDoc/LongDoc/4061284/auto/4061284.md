# Land Acknowledgment  

In the Blackfoot language, Calgary is Moh’kin’stis; in Stoney Nakoda, Wiçispa Oyade; in Tsuut’ina, Gu’tsi’tsi and in Métis, it is Otoskwunee. For each of these Indigenous languages, the words translate to ‘Elbow,’ representing the confluence of the Bow and Elbow Rivers. This is where the story of Calgary begins as the confluence has been a trading hub for Indigenous peoples for millennia and the site where they celebrated natural abundance, ceremony, culture, and partnerships.  

This Plan acknowledges the traditional lands of the Treaty Seven Nations – the Blackfoot Confederacy, (Siksika, Kainai, Piikani), the Tsuut’ina, the Îyâxe Nakoda Nations (Bearspaw, Chiniki, Wesley), the Métis Nation of Alberta, Region 3, and all people who have made Calgary their home. This Plan honours their long history and deep connections to this land.  

# What is the North Hill Communities Local Area Plan?  

The North Hill Communities Local Area Plan provides the long-term vision specific to the North Hill Communities and articulates a broad strategy for accommodating community growth and change. With guidance from the Municipal Development Plan (MDP), this Plan provides community-specific policies related to land use planning and development.  

The following provides a summary of how everyone from the public to a developer can best use this document. Key content of the Plan is summarized below.  

# The Municipal Development Plan  

Calgary’s Municipal Development Plan (MDP) is a statutory plan that lays out a vision for how the city will grow and develop over the next 30 to 60 years. Alberta’s Municipal Government Act requires that the council of every municipality must adopt a Municipal Development Plan by bylaw.  

Together with the Calgary Transportation Plan (CTP), the MDP sets a long-term strategy of a more sustainable city form for Calgary and the transportation networks to serve it. To do so, the MDP encourages growth within the city to make the best use of existing land, reduce the cost of City services, locate residents closer to where they work, shop and play, and support increased mobility options. The longrange target set in the MDP is to accommodate $50\%$ of Calgary’s future population growth to the Developed Areas over the next 60 to 70 years, starting in 2009.

# Guide for Local Area Planning p. v  

# Chapter 1 Visualizing Growth  

Chapter 1 of the Plan contains contextual information, the Plan vision and core ideas that support this vision. The vision and community context guide the application of this Plan and will continue to direct planning and development in the North Hill Communities through implementation of the core ideas.  

# Chapter 2 Enabling Growth  

To achieve the vision and core ideas of Chapter 1, Chapter 2 of the Plan sets out the Future Growth Concept for the North Hill Communities. The Plan applies urban form categories and scale modifiers as well as built form, general and area-specific policies to the local context.  

# Urban Form Categories  

Map 3: Urban Form shows the urban form categories in the Plan area and should be used as a starting point when determining the general function envisioned for a specific area. Readers should review 2.2 Urban Form Categories which provides further details and applicable policies that apply to each urban form category.  

# Scale Modifiers  

Scale modifiers are used to complement an urban form category to provide additional built form policy for specific locations. Map 4: Building Scale shows where the different scale modifiers are applied. Readers should review 2.3 Scale Modifiers which provides an introduction to each scale modifier and their associated policies.  

# General and Area Specific Policies  

The remaining sections in Chapter 2 provide general policies and additional design considerations that apply on a plan-wide or site-specific basis. This Plan provides general policies which primarily focus on the interface of the public realm with buildings and more specific policies apply to areas such as Main Streets, transit station areas, Activity Centres and Greenview Industrial. The additional design consideration provide policy guidance on planning matters such as mobility, heritage and sustainable development.  

# Chapter 3 Supporting Growth  

Chapter 3 of this Plan identifies specific objectives and implementation options for supporting growth and change within the North Hill Communities. This Chapter is intended to set out high-level, strategic direction to inform how investments in the Plan area are made to support the Future Growth Concept.  

# Chapter 4 Implementation and Interpretation  

Chapter 4 contains policies regarding the legal interpretation, status, and limitations of the Plan. The Plan is a statutory plan, as outlined in the Municipal Government Act, and must be read in conjunction with the Municipal Development Plan (MDP), Calgary Transportation Plan (CTP) and other City of Calgary and policy documents. Chapter 4 also contains a Glossary of common terms used throughout the Plan.  

# Appendices  

Additional non-statutory plan information can be found in the Appendices including Appendix A: Implementation Options, Appendix B: Regional Corridors and Context Map, Appendix C: Mobility, and Appendix D: Constraints. The appendices contain information intended to support the vision and core ideas of the Plan.

# 1.1 Introduction  

The North Hill Communities Local Area Plan (Plan) is a long-range, statutory area redevelopment plan that sets out the future vision, objectives and development policies for supporting growth and change in the communities of Capitol Hill, Crescent Heights, Highland Park, Mount Pleasant, Renfrew, Rosedale, Thorncliffe-Greenview (south of McKnight Boulevard N), Tuxedo Park, Winston HeightsMountview and Greenview Industria (Map 1: Context and Communities). Located just north of the Bow River and Downtown, these communities are collectively known as the North Hill Communities (Figure 2: Plan Context). The Plan takes a multi-community approach that recognizes and builds upon the shared assets and features that connect these inner-city and established communities including infrastructure, recreational amenities, public parks and open spaces, Main Streets, corridors, transit station areas and Activity Centres. The nine communities and Greenview Industrial have their own unique history and evolution which is detailed in Section 1.3.  

Realizing the Plan’s vision will depend on several factors such as population growth, economic considerations and development trends. The Plan is meant to be updated periodically as development and change occur.

# 1.2 Vision and Core Ideas  

# Vision  

The North Hill Communities will accommodate a diverse population by providing varied housing options focused around a collection of Main Streets, Activity Centres, civic facilities, parks and open spaces. The North Hill Communities will be well-integrated with local and city-wide mobility networks allowing people of all ages and abilities safe and accessible ways to get around. The North Hill Communities will continue to evolve and grow through high-quality people-focused design, building upon their history as among the best communities to live in Calgary.

# Core Ideas  

The following core ideas were developed through the engagement process and were used to shape the policies and guidelines in Chapters 2 and 3 of this Plan.  

![](images/44a8c687b46a07f5f5ad3bebfaffcee74ec23cc81aa46f0d5be4df52ecaec3b6.jpg)  

Facilitate the continued development of Centre Street N, Edmonton Trail NE, 16 Avenue N and 4 Street NW into vibrant mixed-use Main Streets that are supported by diverse housing options on tree-lined streets and an enhanced public realm.  

Build on and strengthen existing neighbourhood shops and community amenities outside of the four Main Streets with a focus on those located on 20 Avenue NW.

# 1.3 Community Context History  

Calgary is located within the traditional territories of the Treaty Seven Nations. This includes: the Blackfoot Confederacy, made up of the Siksika, Piikani and Kainai First Nations; the Îyâxe Nakoda First Nations, comprised of the Chiniki, Bearspaw and Wesley First Nations; and the Tsuut’ina First Nation. Calgary is also home to the historic Northwest Métis and to Métis Nation of Alberta, Region 3.  

For more than 11,000 years, the confluence of the Bow and Elbow rivers has been important for Indigenous peoples. The escarpment overlooking these rivers, the North Hill, is located along an ancient north-south corridor known as the Old North Trail, where Indigenous peoples have lived, loved, raised families, travelled and traded. With its sheltering river flats, plentiful wood and water and warm Chinook winds in the winter, the Calgary area was a preferred seasonal campsite.  

As a permanently settled place, Calgary began in 1875 as a North-West Mounted Police post. By the time the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) arrived in 1883, Calgary had developed as an unincorporated settlement on the future site of the Inglewood neighbourhood. The CPR laid out a new townsite on its own property in what is now downtown and the settlement moved west at the beginning of 1884. Calgary was incorporated as a town later that year and in 1894 it became a city.  

Before two large annexations added considerably to Calgary’s footprint in 1907 and 1910, the site of the future North Hill Communities lay outside the municipal boundaries. Beginning in the 1880s, the area was settled by homesteaders who obtained their farms through the Dominion Lands Act. The open space of Fox Hollow is a remnant of that agricultural period. As late as the 1940s, it was the site of the East Mount Pleasant Dairy Farm.  

The North Hill Communities area was also a transit corridor. In the manner of the Old North Trail, the Calgary-Edmonton Trail became Calgary’s lifeline to the north. In 1873, Reverend John McDougall cut a new path between Edmonton and his Methodist mission at Morley. The new trail was extended to Calgary in 1875 and its route was surveyed and finalized in 1886. It became known as Edmonton Trail to those travelling north and as Calgary Trail to those travelling south. Before the original wood-truss bridge was completed in  

1890 at what is now the site of the Reconciliation Bridge, travellers forded the Bow River or crossed by ferry.  

Regular mail and stagecoach services began along the Calgary-Edmonton Trail in 1883. The trail’s significance diminished in 1891 with the completion of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway, a CPR subsidiary. The new branch line crossed through the future sites of Renfrew, Winston Heights-Mountview and Greenview Industrial. Passenger service ended in 1985, but the line remains in use for freight service.  

Early in the twentieth century, Calgary experienced an economic and population boom that saw it transformed into a regional wholesale and distribution centre. Speculators began purchasing farmland outside the city limits and registering subdivision plans. In 1906, Oscar G. Devenish (best remembered for building the Devenish Apartments, an extant Beltline landmark) acquired part of the future Capitol Hill site and Archibald John McArthur registered the Crescent Heights subdivision.  

The 1907 annexation gave Calgary a beachhead north of the Bow, including portions of Crescent Heights and Renfrew south of 8 Avenue N. Though most of Crescent Heights lay outside the new city limits, McArthur promoted his subdivision and he built the original Centre Street Bridge that year as a private venture. In 1908, residents organized the Village of Crescent Heights, which had its own municipal council, school board, village constable and volunteer fire brigade. Besides McArthur’s subdivision, the village included portions of the future Mount Pleasant, Renfrew, Tuxedo Park and Winston Heights/Mountview. Before long, villagers petitioned for annexation to Calgary.

The 1910 annexation involved a massive area that included the Village of Crescent Heights and the balance of the North Hill Communities area. The Calgary Municipal Railway, which had been inaugurated in 1909, was a key factor that accelerated and shaped early growth. Homebuilders gravitated toward areas close to streetcar routes and streetcars made commercial uses feasible beyond the city centre. Early subdivisions clustered around the streetcar lines and shared similar features including grid street networks fronted with boulevard trees and landscaped yards.  

Besides Capitol Hill and Crescent Heights, pre-First World War subdivisions included Mountview, Rosedale and Tuxedo Park, as well as the former subdivisions of Balmoral (which now lies within Tuxedo Park), Beaumont and Regal Terrace (now part of Renfrew), the original Mount Pleasant (now part of Crescent Heights), North Balmoral (now Highland Park), Highbury (divided between Capitol Hill, Mount Pleasant and Rosemont), Pleasant Heights (divided between Capitol Hill and Mount Pleasant) and Ree Heights (divided between Greenview Industrial, Highland Park and  

Winston Heights/Mountview). Some were developed while others remained lightly settled or speculative.  

The city’s pre-First World War boom ended in 1913 and Calgary grew modestly in the decades that followed. Its built area contracted in the 1920s through a City program that subsidized the cost of house-moving and encouraged property owners in outlying areas to swap their land for inner-city lots. After the Second World War, Calgary experienced significant urban growth supported by returning veterans, European immigration, government incentives and the late-1940s oil boom. This resulted in new residential development both in established neighbourhoods and new subdivisions such as Winston Heights and Thorncliffe-Greenview.  

Like Bowness, Forest Lawn, Mission and Montgomery, Crescent Heights is one of Calgary’s few neighbourhoods that was once an independent municipality. It remains a diverse inner-city neighbourhood bisected by the Centre Street commercial district and bounded to the north by 16 Avenue. Nearly two dozen sites on The City’s Heritage Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources (Inventory) are located in Crescent Heights,  

including Crescent Heights Senior High School, a Collegiate Gothic landmark built in 1928 and several tree-lined boulevards that reflect the influence of the City Beautiful Movement. The Crescent Heights Community Association was organized in 1947 and revived in 1974 after a period of inactivity.  

Tuxedo Park was subdivided in 1911 and its developer secured a street railway line through an agreement with The City. The developer provided a park, complete with bandstand and gardens, as the streetcar terminus. The Tuxedo Park Community Association, established by 1925 and one of the oldest such organizations in the city, later built its community hall in that park.  

The southern half of the present district began as Balmoral, which included in its design one of only two known historic circuses in Calgary; the other was in Beaumont, which now lies within Renfrew. An element of the City Beautiful Movement, a circus is an intersection with four separate quadrants that join together to make up a landscaped circle. While the Beaumont Circus served primarily as a traffic circle until 1945, it, along with the Balmoral Circus, provided manicured landscaped spaces within these two early neighbourhoods. Historic buildings in the neighbourhood include the Unitarian Church of Calgary (built as Crescent Heights Methodist in 1908, when this was part of the Village of Crescent Heights), a set of worker cottages on 20 Avenue NW and Balmoral School, an Edwardian Classical landmark built of sandstone in 1914.  

Capitol Hill comprises the original subdivision by that name (located west of 14 Street, subdivided in 1910) and part of Pleasant Heights (east of 14 Street, subdivided in 1907). Some development took place in the 1920s, but it took until the 1950s for intensive residential  

development to occur. Capitol Hill Cottage School, built in 1912, is a neighbourhood landmark. Development of Capitol Hill Park began in 1932 and the sprawling Confederation Park opened in 1967. The Capitol Hill Community Association was established in 1948.  

Development began in Mount Pleasant around 1912 and its historic landmarks include two schools from 1913, the sandstone King George School and the smaller, Arts and Crafts-style North Mount Pleasant School, which was converted into an arts centre in 1986. The Mount Pleasant Community Association was founded in 1950. Confederation Park traverses the northwest part of the neighbourhood.  

Renfrew was originally subdivided as Beaumont and Regal Terrace and its southern portion originated as part of Bridgeland. Stanley Jones Elementary School, a Classical Revival sandstone building, has been a landmark since 1913. The area north of the school lay undeveloped until 1929, when it became the site of the Calgary Municipal Airport (known also as the Stanley Jones Airport). It was replaced a decade later by a new facility that was eventually renamed the Calgary International Airport—McCall Field.  

After the Second World War, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) redeveloped the old airport’s grass-covered runways with post-war housing for returned veterans and their families. The new Renfrew neighbourhood incorporated curvilinear streets as well as small parks, taking inspiration from the neighbourhood unit planning concept developed in New York by Clarence Perry in the 1920s. Further subdivisions in the 1950s in Renfrew added to the CMHC plan.

Present-day Highland Park comprises the former subdivisions of North Balmoral, which was subdivided in 1908 and Ree Heights, which was subdivided in 1910. Some homes were constructed as early as 1910, but the neighbourhood remained largely undeveloped until after the Second World War. However, a group of prewar houses, built elsewhere and later relocated, stand along 34 Avenue between 1 and 2 Streets NE. The Highland Park Community Association was established in 1946. James Fowler High School opened in Highland Park in 1963.  

Rosedale was subdivided in 1909 and Crescent Road emerged early as a scenic boulevard where six houses on The City’s Inventory, built between 1913 and 1952, are located. Rosedale boasts historic tree-lined boulevards influenced by the City Beautiful Movement. The neighbourhood developed slowly, with construction booms in the late-1920s and late-1940s. The Rosedale Community Association was established in 1950.  

Mountview originally extended eastward from Edmonton Trail NE between 16 Avenue and 24 Avenue NE. Even before its initial subdivision in 1907, Mountview was home to the city’s smallpox hospital, which stood at 16 Avenue and 5 Street NE by 1906. It was replaced in 1913 by the Mountview Hospital, a larger complex for smallpox, tuberculosis and other isolation cases. From 1923 until 1958, the building housed the Mountview Home for Girls. It was later demolished and replaced by a Calgary Co-op supermarket.  

Winston Heights was developed adjacent to Mountview after the Second World War. The area between 25 Avenue and 30 Avenue NE eastward from Edmonton Trail was subdivided and the first of 60 homes built under the new Veterans’ Land Act were completed by 1946. The Winston Heights Community Association was organized that year and it became the Winston Heights-Mountview Community Association by 1963.  

In 1923, the Regal Golf Course opened in the future Winston Heights/Mountview district. It “16th Avenue NW, Calgary, Alberta”, 1920. Courtesy of Glenbow Archives, NA-3774-55, Archives and Special Collections, University of Calgary was renamed the Elks Golf Club in 1969 and it continues as the Winston Golf Club. Nearby Fox Hollow Golf Course opened in 1990.  

Thorncliffe-Greenview is the union of two separate neighbourhoods that originated in the 1950s. Both are bisected by McKnight Boulevard, which forms the northern boundary of the North Hill Communities. Thorncliffe began in 1954 as Thorncliffe Heights and it was the first Calgary neighbourhood created through a private contract that assigned the cost of utilities, streets and sidewalks to the developer. The small portion of Thorncliffe that lies within the North Hill Communities area comprises four blocks of detached houses between Laycock Drive and McKnight Boulevard NW, a commercial strip along Centre Street (including the Northgate Shopping Centre, built in 1958) and part of Highland Valley Park. The Thorncliffe Heights Community Association was founded in 1956.  

Greenview was approved in 1959 and developed by 1961, when Greenview Elementary School opened and the city’s first rowhousing project was completed in the neighbourhood. Greenview residents joined the community association in neighbouring Thorncliffe. By 1967, it was renamed the Thorncliffe-Greenview Community Association.  

Greenview Industrial, which opened in 1960, followed a pattern established in 1954 when The City developed Calgary’s first industrial park in Manchester. Early landmarks included the Sunset Drive-In (which opened in 1950, predating the industrial park), the Airliner Motor Hotel and Golden Acre Nurseries. In 1976, Calgary Transit relocated to its expansive new Spring Gardens complex in Greenview Industrial.  

Transportation development and settlement patterns contributed to the early emergence of Main Streets in the North Hill Communities, including Edmonton Trail, 16 Avenue N, Centre Street and 4 Street NW.  

As a city street, Edmonton Trail retained its historic name as well as its function as a significant transit corridor. In 1911, it became part of the Crescent Heights streetcar loop as well as the Tuxedo Park extension line to the north. The street developed quickly as a mixed-use residential and commercial street. After the Second World War, the Calgary Transit System (as the Calgary Municipal Railway was renamed) converted its streetcar system to a network of electric trolley coach routes (for trunk lines) and bus routes (for shorter distances). Trolley coaches were rubber-wheeled like buses; however, like streetcars, they required overhead electric trolley wires. The Crescent Heights route, which included Edmonton Trail between the Bow River and 16 Avenue N, became Calgary’s first electric trolley coach route in 1947. In 1958, trolley wires were extended north on Edmonton Trail to 37 Avenue NE. Diesel buses replaced trolley coaches in 1974.  

South of the Bow River, Centre Street was originally aligned with the CPR station in a typical CPR townsite pattern. The City’s purchase of the private Centre Street Bridge in 1912 and construction of the present bridge in 1916–17 projected the street’s Main Street function, including mixed-use residential and commercial development, north of the Bow River. Streetcar service extended across the bridge to 4 Avenue N in 1917, to 20 Avenue N in 1919 and, ultimately, to 32 Avenue N. Trolley coaches replaced streetcars in 1947, initially to 36 Avenue N and, in 1957, to Northmount Drive.  

16 Avenue N follows a section line that was surveyed in the early 1880s. It formed the northern boundary of the short-lived Village of Crescent Heights and it developed as a mixed-use Main Street before its annexation to Calgary in 1910. The avenue formed part of the street railway’s Crescent Heights loop as well as the later Centre Street line and Capitol Hill extensions. It became part of the first trolley coach line in 1947. In 1954, 16 Avenue N was designated as part of the TransCanada Highway, which was officially dedicated in 1962. Completion of the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium in 1957 and North Hill Mall in 1959 contributed to the modern development of 16 Avenue N.  

4 Street NW developed as a residential street by 1912. After 1919, it was included in a new streetcar loop that formed along with Centre Street, 12 Avenue NW and 20 Avenue NW. In 1947, 4 Street became part of a new trolley coach line from 12 Avenue to 26 Avenue NW. It was extended to 32 Avenue in 1955 and to Northmount Drive in 1958.  

More recently, Deerfoot Trail was developed in the 1970s and 1980s along the eastern edge of the North Hill Communities as a freeway and provincial highway. The Nose Creek Pathway, a cycling and pedestrian path, was introduced in the mid-1980s.  

Historic peak population for many of the North Hill Communities was reached by the late 1960s. Today, the North Hill Communities comprises nine residential communities and Greenview Industrial. These communities have their own individual boundaries and community associations but are united by shared amenities, schools, urban and neighbourhood Main Streets, Activity Centres, public infrastructure, transit, natural areas and regional and neighbourhood parks.

# Community Characteristics and Attributes  

This section highlights characteristics and attributes for the North Hill Communities that were considered as part of the development of this Plan. These are described below and key attributes are shown on Map 2: Community Characteristics and Attributes. The characteristics and attributes should be considered throughout all subsequent phases of planning and development.  

# Topography  

The North Hill Communities are characterized by relatively high elevation north of the Bow River. Steep escarpments form the south and east boundaries of the area, sloping down to the Bow River and Nose Creek respectively. Gentle slopes grade toward Confederation Park, a regional drainage route for stormwater, in the northwest plan area. Water draining to Confederation Creek flows east and north into Nose Creek.  

# Natural Features and Areas  

The Plan area includes a number of natural areas, parks and open spaces. Natural areas include Nose Creek, located along the eastern edge of the plan area, the Bow River, located along the south and two significant escarpment areas. These natural areas provide ecological value within the city and allow for contextappropriate leisure and recreational opportunities. The North Hill Communities also include a number of major, minor and local parks, most significant of which is Confederation Park, a 160-hectare park which offers a rich mix of activities and amenities in a naturalized setting.  

# Urban Forest  

The mature tree canopy is both an important asset and defining character element for the North Hill Communities. This canopy is comprised of trees on privately landscaped parcels as well as along public streets within boulevards.  Some of these boulevards, particularly along the avenues south of 16 Avenue N, are identified as heritage boulevards due to their historical importance to the wider communities.

Photo: Edmonton Trail NE  

There are four Main Streets in the plan area as identified by the MDP. The MDP includes general policies and development intensity targets for Main Streets that vary depending on whether they are Urban or Neighbourhood Main Streets. Edmonton Trail NE, 16 Avenue N and Centre Street N are Urban Main Streets while 4 Street NW is identified as a Neighbourhood Main Street.  

# Activity Centres  

There are two types of Activity Centres located within the plan area, Neighbourhood and Community Activity Centres. The MDP identifies the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) as a Community Activity Centre. The Plan identifies three Neighbourhood Activity Centres located along 20 Avenue NW at 18 Street NW, 14 Street NW and 10 Street NW.

# Public Transit Infrastructure  

The North Hill Communities provide a number of future and existing transit options including the Max Orange Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) that runs along 16 Avenue N and the future Green Line LRT. In addition, there is highfrequency bus service that runs along Centre Street N as well as local bus routes that provide connections through the community.

# Heritage Resources  

Some of the communities’ heritage resources have been formally recognized on The City of Calgary’s Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources, while others have heritage value and may merit inclusion on the Inventory. Overall, a majority of heritage resources in the plan area are not legally protected from substantial alteration or demolition, but nevertheless individually and collectively contribute to the historic character of the community that is integral to its distinctiveness and value.

# 2.1 Introduction  

The Plan sets out a future framework for growth and change that recognizes and celebrates the elements that connect the North Hill Communities. The Plan vision focuses growth on Main Streets, transit station areas and Activity Centres and supports continued evolution and change within these communities. By implementing this vision, the North Hill Communities will continue to be a unique collection of desirable and welcoming communities for a diversity of people.  

Providing opportunities for a greater number of people to live in the North Hill Communities will contribute to a more efficient use of land and public infrastructure and increased access to mobility options including energy efficient modes of transportation such as  

transit, biking and walking. The Future Growth Concept is aligned with MDP objectives of fostering more compact development, creating complete communities and increasing community vitality and character.

Figure 4:  Complete Communities  

# Creating Complete Communities  

Our journeys are supported by the city around us—the sidewalks, lights, buildings, open space, roads and transit service. The way a community is built-out and evolves should support the activity of the people who are there and those who will be there in the future.  

# 2.1.1 Future Growth Concept  

The Future Growth Concept set out in this Plan envisions accommodating growth and change in key strategic areas as identified in the MDP, through planning and technical analysis and stakeholder engagement conducted in the drafting of the Plan. This vision builds upon the area’s existing characteristics and attributes and also sets the foundation to support investment in increased mobility options, including the Green Line LRT and Max Orange BRT.  

The Plan envisions the area’s four Main Streets supporting high levels of activity and including a broad range of commercial and residential functions. Activity levels will be accommodated through well-designed buildings that support a high-quality public realm and street experience. These are, and will continue to be, the streets with the greatest number of people strolling down them, enjoying shops and restaurants on wide sidewalks with a public realm that offers opportunities to sit, socialize and watch street life. The Green Line LRT will run down one of these Main Streets, Centre Street N, and the Plan envisions this corridor and transit station areas accommodating increased intensity of both residential and commercial land use functions as well as higher building scales than the surrounding residential areas.  

The Max Orange BRT also runs through the Plan area with several stops located along 16 Avenue N. The Plan provides policy direction around BRT stations on 16 Avenue N primarily through the Main Streets policies in Sections 2.5.1.  

The Future Growth Concept also envisions Activity Centres and important east-west corridors such as 20 Avenue N, 12 Avenue N and 8 Avenue N as accommodating more moderate growth in the form of primarily residential, low scaled buildings of generally up to four to six storeys. These areas will provide increased housing options within the North Hill Communities and support locally focused businesses and community amenities.  

The future vision for growth for the North Hill Communities is represented on Map 3: Urban Form and Map 4: Building Scale.  

Together, these two maps indicate where future growth and activity would be focused in the Plan area and define the general function for different parts of the North Hill Communities. These two maps need to be read together to understand the type and scale of development that is appropriate in the Plan area. The specific urban form categories and building scales for locations within the North Hill Communities are described in relation to the overall vision in the policy sections that address each of the distinct geographic parts of the North Hill Communities plan area.  

Map 3: Urban Form illustrates the general location of urban form categories and the block pattern in the Plan area. Together these elements describe the primary community functions/land uses (housing, commercial, industrial, regional campus, parks, civic and recreation and natural areas) and policy consideration for the Plan area. Policies for each of the urban form categories is provided in Section 2.2 Urban Form Categories and must be read together with locally specific policies for Main Streets, Activity Centres, transit station areas and Greenview Industrial where applicable.  

Map 4: Building Scale illustrates the general building height and massing within the Plan area which supports the primary functions shown in Map 3: Urban Form.  Policies for building scale is provided in Section 2.3 Scale Modifiers.  

All development should generally comply with the maps and policies from the Plan.  

# 2.2 Urban Form Categories  

This Plan identifies the location of urban form categories in Map 3: Urban Form. These urban form categories identify and categorize the purpose and general function (land use) of different parts of a community. The relationship between the urban form categories demonstrate how the different areas of a community relate to and support each other.  

People’s personal journeys within the community are the foundation of these urban form categories, establishing what people do in different parts of a community. People go to different areas of a community for different purposes. Places where many people go are high activity areas, while places where fewer people go are lower activity areas. Despite the difference in overall activity level in different communities, the structure is still similar. There are places where activity is focused in a community, such as a Main Street and places that are less active, such as a local residential street.  

There are ten urban form categories that direct land use and built form in the North Hill Communities. This section identifies the characteristics of the urban form categories and where they apply, as well as land use and site, building and landscape design policies for each category.

Figure 6: Neighbourhood Urban Form Categories  

Neighbourhood Commercial Neighbourhood Flex Neighbourhood Connector Neighbourhood Local  

# 2.2.1 Neighbourhood  

There are four Neighbourhood urban form categories – Neighbourhood Commercial, Neighbourhood Flex, Neighbourhood Connector and Neighbourhood Local. These areas are characterized by smaller blocks where buildings are typically oriented to the street. Neighbourhood Commercial and Neighbourhood Flex are most likely in areas with a grid-like street pattern.  

Neighbourhood Commercial areas support a range of commercial uses on the ground floor, with the most active areas requiring uses such as shops, services and restaurants. Neighbourhood Flex areas support a mix of uses on the ground floor. Neighbourhood Connector and Neighbourhood Local areas are primarily residential, with a strong delineation between the private and public realm. At all development scales, the pedestrian experience in Neighbourhood areas should be supported and enhanced by a range of uses with  

comfortable street wall heights and a public realm with features such as landscaping, sidewalks, public trees, cycling infrastructure and on-street parking.  

Residential redevelopment will occur in all communities in a variety of housing forms, such as single-detached, semi-detached, rowhouse, multi-residential or mixeduse buildings. As scale increases, a larger range of unit types may be accommodated. At all scales, redevelopment should consider existing context, parcel layout, building massing, and landscaping to sensitively integrate into the community. Residential areas may also accommodate a range of commercial activities, including child care, small-scale manufacturing, and home-based businesses.

# 2.2.1.1 Neighbourhood Commercial and Neighbourhood Flex  

Neighbourhood Commercial and Neighbourhood Flex represent the more commercially oriented areas of the North Hill Communities, where people go to shop and gather. While people also live in these areas, the public realm and built form are designed to support frequent pedestrian interaction with the buildings and a moderate to high volume of pedestrian movement along the street.  

# Policy  

# Land Use  

a.	  Development in Neighbourhood Commercial and Neighbourhood Flex areas may include a range of uses in stand-alone or mixed-use buildings.   
b. Vehicle-oriented uses are discouraged: i.	  in areas of high pedestrian activity; ii.	  within transit station areas; or, iii.	  where the use interferes with access to cycling infrastructure.  

# Site, Building and Landscape Design  

In addition to the general site, building and landscape design policies in Section 2.4, the following policies apply:  

c.	  Development in Neighbourhood Commercial and Neighbourhood Flex areas should:  

i.	  be oriented towards the street;   
ii.	  not locate parking between a building and a higher activity street;   
iii.	  provide access to off-street parking and loading areas from the lane, where possible;   
iv.	  provide frequent entrances and windows that maximize views to and from the street;   
$\mathsf{v}.$ .	  use building articulation to provide a well-defined, continuous street wall and improve the pedestrian experience using varied textures, high-quality building materials and setbacks; and,   
vi.	  accommodate small variations in the street wall to integrate amenity space.  

.	  Where vehicle-oriented uses are provided, development should be designed to: i.	  minimize the number of locations where vehicles cross the sidewalk; ii.	  minimize driveway width or locate driveways on a lower activity street, where feasible; iii.	  incorporate landscaped areas; iv.	  provide well-defined pedestrian routes to transit stops and stations or adjacent residential areas; and, v.	  provide on-site pedestrian routes to minimize conflicts with vehicles, particularly near access and service areas.  

e.	  Entrances or lobbies that provide shared access should be well-marked, be of a width that is consistent with other units along the same frontage and allow for clear sight lines to and from the building.   
f. The public realm should provide continuous, unobstructed pedestrian routes supported by high-quality landscaping for pedestrian comfort.   
g. Landscaped areas should be located to enhance and complement the interface between the building and the public realm.   
h.	  Where units are located on the ground floor along lower activity streets or lanes, development should be designed to: i.	  accommodate a range of uses; ii.	  provide on-site pedestrian routes along lanes to minimize conflicts with vehicles, particularly near access and service areas; and, iii.	  provide windows with views to the street or lane.  

![](images/d1da227a58c01013c9fea584a665f05a7bef2f0258c92a1800048cbdf59a6674.jpg)  

# 2.2.1.2 Neighbourhood Commercial  

# Guide for Local Area Planning p. 20  

Neighbourhood Commercial areas are characterized by the widest range of commercial uses compared to other urban form categories. Buildings are oriented to the street with units that support commercial uses on the ground floor facing the higher activity street with a range of uses integrated behind or located above.  Commercial frontages have frequent entrances and windows along the street to encourage pedestrian activity.  

Neighbourhood Commercial categories have been applied to areas of the highest commercial activity in the North Hill Communities. This includes along streets such as 16 Avenue N and portions of Centre Street N and Edmonton Trail NE, where commercial activity is continuous for several blocks, as well as on portions of 4th Street NW, 20th Avenue NW, where commercial activity is concentrated around intersections.  

Active Frontage areas on Map 3: Urban Form indicates an area where the ground floor must contain active uses and in the North Hill Communities are applied primarily along Main Streets and transit station areas.  

# Policy  

# Land Use  

a. Commercial uses on the ground floor should be located facing the higher activity street.   
b. Residential uses on the ground floor should be located facing lower activity streets or lanes.   
c. Vehicle-oriented uses are discouraged in Active Frontage areas.  

# Site, Building and Landscape Design  

In addition to the general site, building and landscape design policies in Section 2.4, the following policies apply:  

d.	  Development in Neighbourhood Commercial areas should: i.	  integrate larger commercial or residential uses behind or above smaller units facing the street; and, ii.	  provide well-marked primary entrances for ground floor units facing the street.  

e.	  The public realm in Neighbourhood Commercia areas should be designed to support high volumes of pedestrians through features such a wide sidewalks, street furniture, and lighting.   
f. Active Frontage areas should not provide access to off-street parking or loading from the higher activity street.   
g.	  Development in Active Frontage areas should support active uses. This may include, but is not limited to: i.	  frequent entrances and windows that maximize views to and from the street; ii.	  setbacks to accommodate an extension of the use outside of the building, such as patios and display areas; and, iii.	  a floor-to-ceiling height that supports a range of active uses.

# 2.2.1.3 Neighbourhood Flex  

# Guide for Local Area Planning p. 24  

Neighbourhood Flex areas are characterized by a mix of commercial and residential uses. Buildings are oriented to the street with units that may accommodate commercial uses, offices, personal services, institutional uses, recreation facilities, residential uses and light industrial uses on the ground floor. Uses may be mixed horizontally or vertically within a building or a block.  

Neighbourhood Flex categories have been applied to corridors in the community that have commercial character, or in areas where commercial development would be appropriate, but is not required. This includes areas along Centre Street N north of 31 Avenue, Edmonton Trail NE north of 14 Avenue and along 40 Avenue NW west of Centre Street N. This category has also been applied to areas adjacent to Neighbourhood Commercial nodes and corridors to allow for flexibility in the amount of commercial uses provided in these areas.  

# Policy  

# Land Use  

a.	 Development in Neighbourhood Flex areas should support a range of uses on the ground floor facing the street.  

# Site, Building and Landscape Design  

In addition to the general site, building and   
landscape design policies in Section 2.4, the following   
policies apply:   
b.	  The public realm in Neighbourhood Flex areas should be designed to support moderate to high volumes of pedestrians.  

# 2.2.1.4 Neighbourhood Connector and Neighbourhood Local  

# Guide for Local Area Planning p. 28  

Neighbourhood Connector and Neighbourhood Local represent the more residentially-oriented areas of the North Hill Communities. While some commercial and work from home opportunities exist in these areas, the public realm is designed to support low to moderate volumes of pedestrian movement along the street and the built form typically supports privacy and separation for residential uses.  

# Policy  

# Land Use  

a.	 Development in Neighbourhood Connector and Neighbourhood Local areas of a community should: i.	 be primarily residential uses; and, ii.	 support a broad range and mix of housing types, unit structures and forms.   
b. Development in Neighbourhood Connector and Neighbourhood Local areas may include a range of work-live units or home-based businesses.   
c. Where Industrial Transition is identified in a Neighbourhood Connector or Neighbourhood Local area, development should be encouraged to: i.	 combine compatible industrial working spaces with residential uses; and, ii.	 enable work-live units.  

# Site, Building and Landscape Design  

In addition to the general site, building and landscape design policies in Section 2.4, the following policies apply:  

d.	 Development in Neighbourhood Connector and Neighbourhood Local areas should: i.	 consider the local built form context; ii.	 be oriented towards the street; iii.	 consider shadowing impacts on neighbouring properties; and, iv.	 provide access to off-street parking and loading areas from the lane, where possible.  

e. Entrances or lobbies that provide shared access should be well-marked, be of a width that is consistent with other units along the same frontage and allow for clear sight lines to and from the building.   
f. Where units are located on the ground floor along lower activity streets or lanes, development should be designed to: i.	 locate amenity spaces along the lane, where feasible; ii.	 provide on-site pedestrian routes along lanes to minimize conflicts with vehicles, particularly near access and service areas; and, iii.	 provide windows with views to the street or lane.   
g.	 Development in Industrial Transition areas should: i.	 fully enclose industrial activities in a building and limit off-site impacts; ii.	 accommodate vehicular movement and loading on-site to minimize conflicts with pedestrians; iii.	 encourage industrial working spaces along the lane, where appropriate; iv.	 provide well-marked primary entrances facing the street or lane; $\mathsf{v}.$ provide a transition from the public realm to a building using landscaped space, design features or amenity space; and, vi.	 provide high-quality landscaping.

# Guide for Local Area Planning p. 30  

# 2.2.1.5 Neighbourhood Connector  

Neighbourhood Connector areas are characterized by a broad range of housing types along higher activity, predominantly residential streets. These areas may accommodate small-scale commercial uses to meet residents’ daily needs and often provide connections to other communities. The public realm may include features such as wide sidewalks and cycling infrastructure.  

Neighbourhood Connector categories have been applied to higher activity residential streets. These streets have higher vehicle and pedestrian volumes and are typically collector streets, but are predominantly residential in nature. Streets such as 8 Avenue NE, 12 Avenue N, 20 Avenue N, 24 Avenue NW west of 14 Street NW and portions of 4 Street NW and Edmonton Trail NE are identified as Neighbourhood Connector to reflect this higher activity. Neighbourhood Connector is also applied to blocks that surround major parks, open space and recreational facilities such as the Renfrew Aquatic & Recreation Centre.  

# Policy  

# Land Use  

a.	 Development in Neighbourhood Connector areas should:  

i.	 support a higher frequency of units and entrances facing the street;   
ii.	 support higher density when located near commercial areas and transit station areas; and,   
iii.	 support the development of local commercial uses to serve nearby residents.  

b.	 Development in Neighbourhood Connector areas may include stand-alone or mixed-use buildings.  

# Site, Building and Landscape Design  

In addition to the general site, building and landscape design policies in Section 2.4, the following policies apply:

# 2.2.1.6 Neighbourhood Local  

Neighbourhood Local areas are characterized by a range of housing types and home-based businesses. Neighbourhood Local areas have developed in a variety of ways with characteristics that shape how these areas change and grow, including when the community was built, existing heritage assets, established development pattern and access to parks, open space and other amenities. The public realm may include features such as landscaped boulevards and public street trees.  

The Neighbourhood Local category is the most common category and is applied to the primarily residential areas of the North Hill Communities.  

# Limited Scale Policies  

The policies in this section only apply to Neighbourhood Local Areas that have the Limited Scale modifier. Limited Scale policies recognize that single-detached housing is, and will continue to be, a desirable housing form and may be developed anywhere within Neighbourhood Local, Limited Scale areas. Secondary suites will continue to be allowed where they are currently permitted by the Land Use Bylaw and do not form part of the unit count when considering the following policies.  

# Policy  

a.	 Secondary suites are permitted where already allowed by the existing land use designation and are not considered a unit in the following policies.   
b. Building forms that contain one or two residential units are supported in Neighbourhood Local, Limited Scale.   
c. Building forms that contain three or more residential units should be supported in the following areas: i.	  within transit station areas; ii.	  near or adjacent to an identified Main Street or Activity Centre; iii.	  on higher activity streets, such as where there are adjacent regional pathways or higher volumes of private vehicle or pedestrian activity in a community; and, iv.	  where the parcel has a lane and parking can be accommodated on site.  

d.	  Building forms that contain three or more residential units in Neighbourhood Local, Limited Scale should be designed to complement the surrounding context and consider the impacts of massing, lot coverage and setbacks on the following: i.	  access to sunlight and shade on adjacent parcels; and, ii.	  protection of existing, healthy trees or landscaping on the parcel, where appropriate.  

# Single-Detached Special Study Area  

The following policy recognizes the predominately single-detached low-density housing forms within the Single-Detached Special Study Area as identified on Figure 8: Single-Detached Special Study Area. Future amendments to the Plan to delineate one or more Single-Detached Special Policy Areas will be brought forward to Council following stakeholder outreach and engagement.  

e. Single-Detached should be the predominant low-density housing form within the SingleDetached Special Study Area until one or more Single-Detached Special Policy Areas are identified through a future amendment to the Plan.

ii.	 enhance pedestrian connections through the site and to the adjacent public realm.  

# 2.3 Scale Modifiers  

# Guide for Local Area Planning p. 64  

Scale refers to the combination of height and building mass that influences the experience on the ground floor. Scale modifiers apply to the Neighbourhood and Vehicle-Oriented Commercial areas and are grouped by compatible built forms with similar design expectations to manage the experience of height and massing.  

All buildings, regardless of scale, are expected to meet the standards of design excellence as articulated by the Urban Design Elements in the MDP. At every scale, it is important to establish an appropriate street wall to reduce building bulk, reduce wind impact, provide access to sunlight and create a sense of enclosure for the public realm. Stepbacks above the street wall should be at an appropriate height to respond to the existing street context and reduce shading on the public realm while ensuring a well-defined street wall. At higher scales, this will reduce the overall perception of mass and articulate the building to maximize sunlight penetration and create visual interest.  

The Land Use Bylaw supplements building scale modifiers by regulating specific height, density and setbacks.

# 2.3.5 Scale Transition  

Guide for Local Area Planning 2.28 Scale Transition Policies  

When adjacent parcels have different scale modifiers, development in these areas should be designed to respect their neighbourhood context. This includes considering existing site context, parcel layout, building massing and landscaping in the design of the development, while still achieving the future vision for where growth is accommodated in the community. Alternative methods may be explored and should be considered on their individual merits with consideration for site-specific characteristics, such as heritage.  

# Policy  

a.	 Development should provide transitions in building height and massing where different scale modifiers are located adjacent to each other. This may include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: i.	 using similar street wall heights and building massing along a street; and, ii.	 decreasing height incrementally through a block.  

# 2.4 General Policies  

# 2.4.1 Built Form  

# Guide for Local Area Planning p.76  

The following policies focus on the interface of the public realm with buildings. By focusing on this interface, the Plan supports the area’s primary uses while promoting development that provides for increased activity, comfort and safety. The design of buildings, sites and the public realm contribute to local identity and a sense of place.  

The policies in this section apply to Neighbourhood, Vehicle-Oriented Commercial and Parks, Civic and Recreation urban form categories at all scales, including Industrial Transition areas within these categories. The built form policies do not apply to Industrial General.  

Unless otherwise stated, these policies must be read in conjunction with the policies for each specific policy area in the subsequent sections. These policies are to be applied primarily through the planning applications process and are intended to guide future development.  

# 2.4.1.1 Site Design  

The following policies help guide the development of sites by considering the location of buildings, pedestrian routes, amenity spaces and vehicular movement.  

# Policy  

a. Development should:  

i.	 locate buildings to frame public streets;   
ii.	 limit the area of a site that is dedicated to vehicular movement by minimizing drive aisles, driveway width and the number of locations where vehicles cross the sidewalk;   
iii.	 locate access and service areas off a lane, where possible;   
iv.	 provide well-defined pedestrian routes to nearby transit stops and stations;   
$v_{\cdot}$ identify a hierarchy of pedestrian routes that connect destinations within and to the site;   
vi.	 provide on-site pedestrian routes that minimize conflicts with vehicles, particularly near access and service areas;   
vii.	position landscaped areas that enhance and complement the interface between the building and pedestrian routes;   
viii.	 retain existing, healthy public trees and landscaping on, or adjacent to, development sites;   
ix.	 retain existing, healthy private trees and landscaping on development sites, particularly in street-facing setback areas;   
x.	 design and locate infrastructure in a manner that minimizes disturbances to existing public trees;   
xi.	 consider design and site layouts that accommodate snow storage and removal; and,   
xii.	consider opportunities to provide permeable surfaces to improve the retention and infiltration of stormwater.   
b.	 Where uses are located on the ground floor along a lane, development should be designed to accommodate on-site pedestrian routes to minimize conflicts with vehicles.   
c. Pedestrian access and internal circulation for all new development with multiple buildings should be designed for universal accessibility, where possible.   
d. Development should utilize slope-adaptive design solutions on sites with significant grade changes.   
e. Development should support sharedmobility options in proximity to a transit station area, where appropriate.   
f. Development is encouraged to provide secure bicycle parking and other active transportation supportive amenities.   
g. Alternative solutions or innovative designs may be considered for: i.	 pedestrian access and internal circulation, where challenging topography or other site constraints exist; and, ii.	 accessing and servicing a development, where standard requirements cannot be met.  

Guide for Local Area Planning 3.1 Site Design Policies  

# Guide for Local Area Planning 3.1 Site Design Policies  

h.	 Development adjacent to or facing parks and open space, including interfaces separated by a lane or street, should:  

i.	 activate the park and open space through site and building design;   
ii. provide amenity space facing the park or open space;   
iii. provide views into the park and open space;   
iv.	 minimize shadow impacts;   
$\mathsf{v}.$ consider opportunities for commercial frontages facing the park and open space in commercial or mixed-use developments;   
vi.	 consider integrating pedestrian routes to the park or open space;   
vii.	  consider opportunities for residential units facing the park and open space; and,   
viii.	 use landscaped areas to delineate open spac and property boundaries, where possible.  

i.	 Development adjacent to Parks, Civic and Recreation should minimize shadowing on these areas. A shadow study may be required at the Development Permit stage to determine potential impacts and mitigation strategies. Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, building orientation, limited floor-plate size and tower separation.  

m.	 Utility upgrades should be coordinated, when feasible and appropriate, with other infrastructure improvements, particularly along Main Streets and in transit station areas.   
n.	 Development on streets with road rights-of-way setbacks should use the setback area to provide for an improved public realm and create safe, welcoming pedestrian environments. Design considerations are subject to technical feasibility and may include, but are not limited to: i.	 Improved sidewalks (width, surface treatment, accessibility); ii.	 enhanced landscaping; iii.	 street trees, where feasible, using high-quality standards for tree planting including the use of high-quality soil material, sufficient soil volume and other best practices/techniques to promote long-term sustainability of newly planted trees; iv.	 street furniture; and, $\mathsf{v}.$ integration with transit stops.   
j.	 Development adjacent to Confederation Park should minimize shadowing on the park. Buildings should not cast shadows into Confederation Park beyond a line 25 meters from, and parallel to, the shared property boundary for a duration exceeding one hour between the hours of 10:00 and 16:00 Mountain Time between March 21 and September 21. A shadow study will be required at the Development Permit stage to determine potential impacts and mitigation strategies.   
k.	 A portion of the plan area falls within the Nose Creek sub watershed. Development within this area should consider the Nose Creek Watershed Management Plan in planning and site design decisions.   
l. Existing mature trees should be protected and maintained on City-owned lands, including boulevards, parks and other parcels. Any impacts to trees or other vegetation on heritage boulevards identified on The City’s Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources should be avoided wherever possible and if avoidance is not possible, mitigated using best practices for tree protection.  

![](images/15becd9e3b34f8122536ef9ba799b4ff566135c07e1851187f42593006047e14.jpg)  

# 2.4.1.2 Building Design  

Well-designed buildings contribute to a sense of place and a positive pedestrian experience. Building massing influences how we perceive the height and volume of a building. A consistent street wall rhythm and height creates a sense of enclosure and continuity that contributes to pedestrian comfort. The use of materials, colour and building features help to give a building character and visual interest. Buildings should be designed to create high-quality living and working environments and foster a vibrant and active public realm.  

Activity on the street is influenced by the design of the ground floor of a building and the interface with the public realm. Building frontage design will vary based on the uses in the building. Commercial uses on the ground floor should be accessible to the street with frequent entrances and windows to maximize views to and from the street and allow for opportunities to extend those uses into the public realm. Residential frontages should provide a transition from a home to the public realm, usually with landscaped areas. Lanes typically provide for servicing and access, but they also provide a unique opportunity in some circumstances to animate the lane through uses such as work-live units or light industrial activities.  

# Policy  

# Guide for Local Area Planning 3.2 Building Design Policies  

a. Development should be designed to:  

i.	 provide a well-defined, continuous street wall of a height proportionate to the width of the street and appropriate to the scale and uses of the area to provide a sense of enclosure;   
ii.	 use building articulation to define the street wall and improve the pedestrian experience using varied textures, change in building materials, façade articulation and setbacks;   
iii.	 differentiate the street wall from upper portions of a building using varied textures, change in materials, façade articulation and setbacks;   
iv.	 use variation in building heights, rooflines and massing to reduce building bulk, avoid long, uninterrupted building frontages and create architectural interest;   
$\mathsf{v}.$ reduce the impacts of wind at the ground floor and to optimize sunlight access to the public realm, open spaces and amenity spaces;   
vi.	 integrate mechanical equipment as part of the overall design of the building; and,   
vii.	use durable and climate resilient building materials.

iii.	 setbacks that allow for a transition from the public realm to residential units that incorporate landscape and design elements or amenity spaces.  

f. Development located within Neighbourhood Local or Neighbourhood Connector areas that have a Low Scale modifier, excluding Main Streets and Activity Centres, should provide a building stepback at or below the fourth storey to mitigate the impact of massing and scale on adjacent lower-scale development. Exceptions may be considered where the development demonstrates an appropriate transition through use of design tools, including but not limited to: i.	 overall reduction in building mass; ii.	 increased setbacks; and, iii.	 building articulation.  

# 2.4.1.3 Amenity Space  

Amenity spaces provide opportunities for people to gather, socialize, play and relax. There are three types of amenity space: publicly-accessible, shared private and private. Shared private and private amenity spaces provide a place for people who live or work in a development to interact, recreate and relax, while public-accessible amenity spaces can by enjoyed by all.  

# Policy  

a.	 Publicly-accessible amenity spaces should be located and designed to enhance the public realm.   
b.	 Where provided, shared private amenity spaces should be for the use of all occupants of a development and universally-accessible, where possible.   
c. Building façades adjacent to publicly-accessible or shared private amenity spaces should: i.	 complement the space using high-quality materials; ii.	 be of an appropriate scale to support user comfort; and, iii.	 provide windows and entrances that offer views to and from the building where it is adjacent to shared or publicly-accessible interior space.   
d.	 Publicly-accessible and shared private amenity spaces should: i.	 be adequately sized to accommodate the anticipated number of users; ii.	 be flexible and adaptable to a variety of activities and programming; iii.	 include lighting and furniture; iv.	 consider sunlight and shade access; and, $v_{\cdot}$ provide weather protection to support year-round use.

i.	 be adequately sized to accommodate furniture; ii.	 consider both sunlight and shade access; and, iii.	 provide weather protection to support year-round use.  

f. Publicly-accessible and shared private amenity spaces are encouraged to provide opportunities for urban agriculture.  

# 2.4.1.4 Landscape Design  

Landscaped areas have many benefits, including improving stormwater management, supporting urban wildlife and offering a place for people to connect to nature. Landscaped areas can be incorporated into amenity spaces and provide green infrastructure.  

# Policy  

a. Landscaped areas should:  

i.	 provide a transition from the public realm;   
ii.	 enhance and complement the interface between the building and the public realm;   
iii.	 incorporate existing, healthy trees and landscaping, where possible;   
iv.	 delineate open space and property boundaries, where possible;   
v.	 provide shade in areas of high sun exposure; and,   
vi.	 identify site entrances and gateway sites with distinctive landscape design features.  

Landscaped areas should: i.	 use climate resilient plant material, including native and locally adaptive species; ii.	 avoid the use of invasive species; iii.	 ensure sufficient soil volumes and adequate spacing to support healthy plant growth; and, iv.	 locate plants in areas suitable to their specific growing needs. c.	 Plant material selected for landscaped areas should: i.	 incorporate a range of plant species to promote biodiversity; ii.	 use plants that provide food for people or wildlife; iii.	 use a range of tree species to contribute to the urban tree canopy; iv.	 provide year-round visual interest; and, v.	 be low maintenance, where possible.

# 2.5.1.1 Urban Main Streets  

There are three Urban Main Streets in the North Hill Communities Plan area. These include Centre Street N, from 7 Avenue N to McKnight Boulevard N; Edmonton Trail NE, from 5 Avenue NE to 41 Avenue NE; and 16 Avenue N, from Deerfoot Trail NE to 19 Street NW.  

# Policy  

a.	 To create a human-scaled street environment on Urban Main Streets, development should demonstrate how the building design and massing responds to the adjacent development context. Design strategies may include, but are not limited to: i.	 building stepbacks at or below the sixth storey; ii.	 overall reduction of building mass at or above the sixth storey; and, iii.	 building articulation. New low-intensity uses such as single-detached, semi-detached and duplex housing are strongly discouraged.  

# Centre Street N  

Centre Street N is situated in the heart of the North Hill Communities. Not only is it an important Urban Main Street for this area, providing services, amenities and high-frequency transit to area residents, but it is also important for the wider city and draws visitors from beyond the plan area. In addition, the future Green Line LRT will run on this street connecting to the Downtown and communities to the north.  

c.	 Alternative parking designs, protocols and strategies may be considered where parcel depth is limited and imposes a constraint on the ability to implement an appropriately-sized and functional parkade.  

# 16 Avenue N  

16 Avenue N serves both as an important Urban Main Street and transportation corridor in the plan area. This Plan envisions this Main Street accommodating a greater diversity of uses and higher levels of pedestrian activity to support primary transit investments in this area.  

d.	 Underground parking within required road rightsof-way setback and/or front setback area may be allowed subject to confirmation of technical feasibility (e.g. location of utilities).  

e.	 Underground parking that extends underneath a public lane may be considered, subject to confirmation it is technically feasible and the successful transfer of ownership for that portion of the lane to the applicant/developer. The City should retain an access easement over the land to keep the lane available for public use, where feasible.  

# Edmonton Trail NE  

Edmonton Trail NE is an Urban Main Street which runs parallel to Centre Street N. The Plan envisions Edmonton Trail NE building upon its role as an important corridor with primarily commercial uses south of 16 Avenue N and primarily housing uses north of 16 Avenue N. Edmonton Trail NE also passes through Greenview Industrial where it provides an important goods movement function and supports more vehicular-oriented industrial and commercial uses. Policy direction is provided primarily through the urban form categories, additional policy guidance and scale identified on Maps 3 and 4.

# 2.5.2 Transit Station Areas  

The North Hill Communities includes four transit station areas along Centre Street N and the Green Line LRT. These transit station areas are located around 9 Avenue N, 16 Avenue N, 28 Avenue N and 40 Avenue N. The exact location for these stations will be determined through detailed design for the Green Line LRT.  

This Plan envisions transit station areas as gateways to the North Hill Communities, with streetscapes and buildings designed to accommodate high levels of pedestrian activity and support a wide range of different uses, activities and mobility options. This includes a mix of commercial, office and residential uses as well as a high-quality public realm.  

The Plan identifies areas in the immediate proximity of stations as Core Zones where pedestrian activity and building scale are envisioned to be the highest. This is achieved by applying the Neighbourhood Commercial urban form category, Active Frontage policy guidance and higher building scale in these areas. Building scales gradually decrease away from the transit station in Transition Zones, which is achieved through lower building scales relative to the Core Zones.  

# 16 Avenue N Station Area  

The 16 Avenue N Station is envisioned to be an urban station and one of the busiest stations outside of the Downtown. The 16 Avenue N Station is near many services, amenities and unique community sites such as Balmoral School, Balmoral Circus and Munro Park. Located at the intersection of two Main Streets and intersecting with the Max Orange BRT, this station area is expected to have the highest level of activity and greatest development intensity in the Plan area are well-connected to the city-wide pedestrian and cycling network. Tall buildings with Active Frontages at-grade and commercial and residential uses abovegrade will accommodate increased jobs and people to support the Green Line LRT and Max Orange BRT.  

# 9 Avenue N Station Area  

The 9 Avenue N Station is envisioned to be a community station designed to fit within the existing context of the neighbourhood. Located in the heart of Crescent Heights, this station has prominent views of Downtown and is a gateway to Crescent Heights and the North Hill Communities. The station is in close proximity to parks and civic and recreation facilities, including Crescent Heights Park, Rotary Park and the North Hill Community Curling Club.  

The 9 Avenue N Station Area is bookended to the east by the Beaumont/Regal Terrace Heritage Guideline Area and to the west by the Crescent Heights Heritage Guideline Area, which are characterized by high concentrations of heritage assets. As a community station, development intensity is envisioned to focus primarily on Centre Street N with appropriate transitions provided to adjacent lower scale housing areas.

# 40 Avenue N Station Area  

The 40 Avenue N Station is the most northern Green Line LRT station within the North Hill Communities. This station will provide transit service to residents and access to schools, amenities and employment opportunities. The station is a gateway to the community of Highland Park and Greenview Industrial. Greenview Industrial’s proximity to this future station presents a unique opportunity to integrate and support light industrial uses within the transit station area. The station area will promote the use of transit by creating convenient, comfortable, direct and safe pedestrian linkages to and from the Green Line LRT station including to Buchannan School, James Fowler High School and the Highland Park Community Centre.  

The station area also benefits from crosstown BRT along 40 Avenue N, connecting this area to employment areas to the east. The highest scale development will be located at Centre Street N and 40 Avenue N, providing housing and employment options to support transit use and create a vibrant station area.  

# 28 Avenue N Station Area  

The 28 Avenue N Station is a community station that provides opportunities to integrate and enhance Tuxedo Park, the Centre Street N Main Street and the surrounding Tuxedo Park community. Located in an area that has many existing shops, residences and amenities, this transit station area will provide a mixeduse activity node for the local community and will support transit ridership by increasing opportunities for people to live and work around the future station.  

The Transition Zone is intended to transition development intensity and building scale from the Core Zone to lower-scale, primarily residential areas and provide enhanced connections to the Core Zone and other Main Streets, including 4 Street NW and Edmonton Trail NE.

# Policy  

a.	 Development adjacent to an LRT station should provide for a high-quality public realm that strengthens the sense of place and encourages social gathering and cultural and recreation activities through elements such as a publicly-accessible private open space or transit plazas, street furniture, seating areas and enhanced landscaping.  

b.	 Development adjacent to an LRT station should include design measures that enhance the transit interface and make the area comfortable for people waiting for transit by locating uses that support high levels of activity, such as retail frontages, immediately adjacent to transit stops and including architectural features that provide weather protection and create human-scaled environments.   
c.	 To encourage additional activity within transit station areas, development should consider activation of lanes through strategies such as providing uses that front the lane, enhanced landscaping and mobility features and incorporating street art.  

# d. Affordable housing is strongly encouraged in transit station areas. Guide Policy 4.3.d.  

e.	 Vehicle parking for new development in Core Zones should be located underground or in a parking structure. Where surface parking is provided, it should not be located between a building and a street and should be screened from the public sidewalk.  

f. Development in Core Zones may exceed, with a limited number of storeys, the building scale identified on Map 4: Building Scale while still meeting the overall intent of the building scale.  A proposed development should only be allowed to exceed the building scale where:  

i.	 The development meets a high standard of design excellence including, but not limited to:  

A.	 providing for a substantially enhanced, high-quality public realm;   
B.	 iconic architectural design that emphasizes the station as a gateway;   
C.	 creating a sense of place through public art or other unique design elements;   
D.	 including sustainable building and site design elements; and,   
E.	 provision of affordable housing.  

ii.	 The development can mitigate the off-site impacts of any additional height, massing and shadowing within the surrounding area through design strategies such as:  

A.	 limited floor plate sizes; B.	 increased stepbacks and/or reduced massing on upper storeys; and, C.	 building orientation.  

g. Except for the 16 Avenue N Station Area, development within Core Zones should have a minimum building height of two storeys.  

h. Development in core zones should: Guide Policy 4.4.a.ii and iii  

i.	 provide publicly-accessible amenity spaces; and,   
ii.	 provide connections to support a comfortable and safe pedestrian and cycling experience and complete missing links to the transit station.  

i. Development in transition zones should provide connections to adjacent mobility infrastructure to support a comfortable and safe pedestrian and cycling experience. Guide Policy 4.5.a.ii  

# 16 Avenue N Station Area  

j.	 Development at the corners of Centre Street N and 16 Avenue N should have a minimum building height of six storeys.   
k.	 Development within the rest of the Core Zone in the 16 Avenue N Station Area should have a minimum building height of four storeys.   
l. Development within the Transition Zone in the 16 Avenue N Station Area should have a minimum building height of two storeys.   
m.	 Development within 200 metres of the Balmoral School site should minimize shadowing on the historic school and outdoor play areas. A shadow study will be required at the development permit stage to determine potential impacts and mitigation strategies for shadowing. Such strategies may include, but are not limited to: building orientation, limited floor plate size and tower separation.  

# 28 Avenue N Station Area  

n.	 In conjunction with the design and development of the 28 Avenue N Station, The City should undertake a comprehensive review of the design and programming of the adjacent Tuxedo Park to ensure that the park design is appropriate for a site directly adjacent to an LRT station. Any redesign should ensure that the park is multi-functional to serve multi-generational users and includes significant areas of open space.

# 2.5.3.1 Community Activity Centres  

Community Activity Centres are identified on Map 1: Urban Structure Map of the MDP. These are areas of moderate job and population growth with connections to primary transit such as LRT. The Southern Alberta Institute of Technology represents the only Community Activity Centre in the North Hill Communities Plan area.  

# Policy  

# Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT)  

This Plan recognizes SAIT as an important employer and destination for post-secondary students from Calgary and beyond. The Plan supports SAIT’s intensification as a central campus and urban academic village. The following policies are intended to inform development along SAIT’s interface with the 16 Avenue Main Street:  

a.	 Development along 16 Avenue NW should adhere to the Main Streets policies of Section 2.5.1.   
b.	 Architectural features and public spaces that provide a distinct sense of place are encouraged at the major north-south intersections with 16 Avenue NW to showcase the prominent role of SAIT on this Main Street including the following locations: i.	 14 Street NW: taking advantage of this prominent location to create a first impression of SAIT from the west and to mark the western gateway to the Plan area; ii.	 12 Street NW: drawing attention to the principal pedestrian entrance to the college on 16 Avenue; and, iii.	 10 Street NW: complementing the concentration of development activity on the northern side of 16 Avenue in this location.  

# 2.5.3.2 Neighbourhood Activity Centres  

Neighbourhood Activity Centres are small mixeduse nodes located within communities that provide opportunities for local job and population growth as well as varied community activities.  

There are three Neighbourhood Activity Centres in the North Hill Communities, two of which are fully within the Plan area and one that is partially within it. These are centred around the intersections of 18 Street NW and 20 Avenue NW, 14 Street NW and 20 Avenue NW and 10 Street NW and 20 Avenue NW. These Activity Centres currently provide local commercial and community amenities and are envisioned to transition to higher intensity, mixed-use development.  

# Policy  

a.	 Development in Neighbourhood Activity Centres should include improvements to the public realm in order to create a safe and welcoming pedestrian environment. Design considerations include, but are not limited to: i.	 wider sidewalks that exceed minimum standards and the provision of street trees and green stormwater infrastructure, where feasible; ii.	 publicly accessible amenity areas, public open space, street furniture and/or street lighting; iii.	 closure of existing driveways on streets; and, iv.	 curb extensions, where appropriate.  

![](images/2ad1baa3645e2bc89c757d6bb34032e050caa786491b2148aca20a9f189c34e6.jpg)  

# 2.5.4 Greenview Industrial  

Greenview Industrial serves as an important employment area for both the North Hill Communities and the wider city. General industrial uses characterize the lands to the east of Nose Creek, while a mix of light industrial, commercial, institutional and housing uses characterize the lands to the west. Uses range from auto body and automotive repair shops, retail and restaurants, to places of worship and seniors housing.  

The following policies are intended to support the continued diversity and evolution of Greenview Industrial by encouraging opportunities for more job-intensive and innovative industrial uses closer to Centre Street N and greater integration of light industrial uses and residential uses along the area’s interface with the Highland Park and Winston HeightsMountview communities.  

# Policy  

a.	 Light and medium industrial uses should be retained, particularly for the lands east of Nose Creek. Industrial uses that are retail or office focused, may be considered along McKnight Boulevard NE and 41 Avenue NE without amending Map 3: Urban Form.   
b.	 Industrial development that generates high levels of employment is encouraged for the lands west of Nose Creek, particularly in proximity to the future 40 Avenue Green Line LRT station.   
c. Development on the west side of Nose Creek should provide for and/or improve sidewalk connections adjacent to their sites.   
d.	 Development adjacent to Nose Creek should include a landscaped buffer with native plantings along the shared boundary to provide a natural transition between the development site and the creek.   
e.	 Development should provide adequate screening along industrial/residential interfaces to mitigate the visual impact of industrial uses and/or storage on primarily housing areas.  

# 2.6 Heritage  

Heritage resources and heritage assets are valued parts of our communities and Calgary as a whole. Both individually and collectively they contribute to community character and help create a sense of identity and place. Heritage tells the story of past generations for present and future generations. Heritage conservation is part of good city building and provides both economic and environmental benefits. Reuse of existing structures, for example, can provide significant energy savings while historic structures and districts can stimulate commercial activity and increase tourism activity and spending.  

Heritage takes various forms in the North Hill Communities. These include historic buildings that may be formally recognized on the Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources, heritage boulevards such as those identified on Map 2: Community Characteristics and Attributes, as well as individual buildings and clusters of character homes (heritage assets) within heritage guideline areas. This section provides policy for heritage in the North Hill Communities.  

# 2.6.1 Heritage Resources  

Heritage resources are defining characteristics of communities and should be retained or protected while balancing the ability to redevelop. New development within the context of heritage resources should consider opportunities to balance both new and historic forms of development. The City of Calgary recognizes that there are Heritage Resources other than buildings that include archaeological and culturally significant areas.  

![](images/d062ec20051f4ef297376f4a0dadc3cc5993b3f4d089c840320eb805cfaa46ba.jpg)

# Policy  

a.	 Property owners are encouraged to retain and conserve heritage resources through adaptive reuse.   
b.	 The Development Authority should support Land Use Bylaw relaxations to enable the  retention of heritage resources.   
c. Property owners are encouraged to designate Inventory properties as Municipal Historic Resources.   
d.	 The City may incentivize the designation of Municipal Historic Resources on a case by case basis through strategies such as allowing for additional development potential.   
e.	 An applicant shall provide photo documentatio of Inventory properties to The City prior demolition or redevelopment. Interpretative or commemorative features should be incorporated into the new development.  

Guide for Local Area Planning 3.8 Heritage Resources Policies  

f.	 Opportunities to mitigate or offset negative outcomes for heritage conservation should be explored at the time of a planning application, including, but not limited to: i.	 retention and incorporation of the heritage resource into the new development; or, ii.	 protection of another heritage resource within the surrounding area.   
g.	 New development should be compatible with the context of abutting sites on the Inventory using setbacks, massing, street wall height and landscaping.   
h.	 New development is encouraged to conserve and integrate heritage resources, in accordance with the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada (2010).  

i. The conservation of heritage resources is encouraged by supporting higher-density development and/or additional uses on sites where a heritage resource or cluster of heritage resources is retained.  

# 2.6.2 Heritage Guideline Areas  

Portions of the North Hill Communities have concentrations of heritage assets that warrant additional study and planning. Heritage assets are privately owned structures, typically constructed prior to 1945, that significantly retain their original form, scale, massing, window/door pattern and architectural details or materials. Individual heritage assets may not warrant inclusion on the Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources.  

To celebrate the history of the North Hill Communities as some of Calgary’s earliest neighbourhoods and respect the area’s heritage assets, Heritage Guideline Areas have been identified for areas that have concentrated groups of heritage assets. These are conceptually shown on Map 5: Heritage Guideline Areas. The Heritage Guideline Areas are named after the historic neighbourhoods that formed the urban beginnings of the individual communities that now comprise the North Hill Communities. While the names of some of these historic neighbourhoods are still reflected in many of the current communities, the exact boundaries of these early neighbourhoods often differ from their modern-day descendants. Nonetheless, these early neighbourhoods shared many urban characteristics that make the North Hill Communities what they are today and the historic structures that still line many of the streets in these areas are character defining community elements. The Heritage Guideline Areas include:  

Balmoral;   
Beaumont / Regal Terrace;   
Crescent Heights;   
Mount Pleasant;   
Mount View;   
Pleasant Heights;   
Rosedale; and, West Mount Pleasant.  

Through future updates, the Plan will apply locallyspecific heritage guidelines to the identified Heritage Guideline Areas. These guidelines will  

be informed by the character-defining elements of heritage assets in these areas with the intent of ensuring that new development fits into the historic fabric and context. In identifying these areas, the Plan recognizes that further work is required to both identify and draft the appropriate guidelines. The Heritage Guideline Areas shown on Map 5:  

Heritage Guideline Areas are, therefore, intended to allow for this future work. It is anticipated that in addition to locally specific guidelines, this work could result in refinements to the area boundaries.  

# Policy  

The following policies apply to the Heritage Guideline Areas identified in Map 5: Heritage Guideline Areas:  

a.	 Land use redesignation for higher density development are strongly discouraged until heritage guidelines have been established for the Plan area.  

b.	 Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact The City to determine development considerations related to heritage prior to submitting a planning application.  

New buildings that contain dwelling unit or backyard suite uses should be made discretionary within a land use district in heritage guideline areas.  

d.	 Heritage design guidelines may identify characterdefining elements that new developments should include, such as the following:  

i.	 roof pitch or style;   
ii.	 front-yard setbacks;   
iii.	 window and/or door pattern;   
iv.	 front façade projections;   
v.	 site access or design; and, vi.	 general massing considerations.  

e.	 Heritage design guidelines may not include guidance regarding the following:  

i.	 land use designation;   
ii.	 parcel size; and,   
iii.	 number or size of dwelling units or suites.

# 2.7 Mobility  

# Guide for Local Area Planning p. 88  

People of all ages, genders, incomes and abilities should be able to safely and conveniently move around the city. A well-connected mobility network that includes options for walking, cycling, taking transit and using personal vehicles provides people with mobility choices to meet a variety of needs and preferences year-round. Winter travel preferences and needs are unique and should be accounted for to ensure a safe and accessible mobility network. This network is critical to achieving healthy and resilient communities.  

The policies in this section provide direction for the development of mobility infrastructure that connect people to destinations and complement the Always Available for All Ages & Abilities (5A) network identified in Appendix C: Mobility. These policies guide the review of planning applications for developments that contribute publicly-accessible amenities, infrastructure or facilities.  

# 2.7.1 Pedestrian  

Pedestrian routes are a critical element of a wellconnected mobility network. Both public and private pedestrian routes should be convenient, safe, comfortable and accessible and provide connections within developments, communities and to the citywide network. The design of pedestrian routes must accommodate people of all abilities in the volumes that are anticipated based on the function and use of the area.  

# Policy  

a. Pedestrian routes should:  

i.	 be universally accessible; ii.	 be wide enough for the anticipated volume of pedestrians based on the street function and context and at minimum allow pedestrians to pass one another both on foot and using accessibility aids; iii.	 provide continuous, unobstructed paths of travel; iv.	 be well-lit; and, $\mathsf{v}.$ be designed to accommodate yearround use and maintenance. b.	 Pedestrian routes should be appropriately sized for the anticipated number of pedestrians. This includes, but is not limited to: i.	 requiring increased building setbacks from a property line shared with a street, where portions of a building below grade or in upper storeys may project into the additional building setback area; or, ii.	 increasing the width of the public realm within the road right-of-way.  

c.	 New pedestrian crossings should be well-defined, well-lit and designed in a manner that is convenient and safe to minimize conflicts with vehicles.   
d.	 Pedestrian routes are encouraged to provide a buffer between the sidewalk and the road to enhance the comfort of all users, through strategies such as: i.	 providing street furniture; ii.	 landscaped boulevards; iii.	 cycling infrastructure; and, iv.	 on-street parking.  

# Guide for Local Area Planning 3.10 Pedestrian Policies  

# 2.7.2 Cycling  

Cycling routes are a critical element of a well-connected mobility network. Cycling infrastructure should be convenient, safe, comfortable, accessible and provide connections both to and within developments, communities and to the city-wide network. The design of cycling routes must accommodate people of all abilities in the volumes that are anticipated based on the function and use of the area.  

# Policy  

# Guide for Local Area Planning 3.11 Cycling Policies  

a. Cycling infrastructure should:  

i.	 be wide enough for the anticipated volume of cyclists based on the street function and context; ii.	 provide continuous, unobstructed paths of travel; iii.	 be well lit; iv.	 be designed to accommodate year-round use; and, v.	 provide facilities to repair, maintain and securely store bicycles, where feasible.   
b. Opportunities to improve the safety and convenience of cycling infrastructure should be explored, such as: i.	 separated, raised or protected bike lanes and intersections; and, ii.	 bicycle-specific traffic signals.   
c. Secure bicycle storage is encouraged in transit station areas.   
d.	 Public bicycle parking facilities should be: i.	 incorporated into development and public infrastructure and covered to support yearround and all-weather cycling; and, ii.	  conveniently located, well-lit and prominent.  

e. Extensions to the regional pathway network should connect to the broader cycling network to serve a recreation and mobility function, where possible.  

# 2.7.3 Transit  

Transit service is a critical element of a well-connected mobility network, connecting people to destinations across the city. A range of destinations helps make transit a convenient and attractive alternative to personal vehicles.  

# Policy  

# Guide for Local Area Planning 3.12 Transit Policies  

a. Transit connections should be direct and convenient.   
b.	 Transit stops and infrastructure should be integrated with pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in a safe and convenient manner.   
c. Transit stops should provide high-quality transit infrastructure that enhances comfort, safety and predictability for transit users.   
d.	 New transit station design should consider opportunities to incorporate integrated civic facilities and plazas.   
e. Development located adjacent to transit stops is encouraged to seamlessly integrate with these stops by providing on-site transit amenities or shelters.  

# 2.7.4 Parking  

The following parking policies support flexibility in how and where parking is provided to incentivize development in locations that support a range of mobility, housing and commercial options. Managing parking at a district scale, rather than site-by-site, may result in more efficient land use. Parking policies and regulations need to be adaptive to current needs while enabling communities to be more responsive to future trends.  

# Policy  

a.	 Applications for new multi-family residential developments that propose no on-site parking, or significant reductions in on-site parking, may be considered by Administration when the criteria from the Calgary Parking Policies are met. Parking requirements should be reduced or relaxed where development is located within one or more of the following: i.	 Activity Centres, Main Streets or other areas of higher activity; ii.	 transit-oriented development areas and transit station areas; or, iii.	 shared mobility operating areas.   
c.	 Parking requirements should be reduced or relaxed for the following types of development: i.	 development that retains historic buildings on the Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources; ii.	 development of affordable housing as defined and accepted by The City; iii.	 development of care facilities; and, iv.	 development that incorporates significant sustainable building measures.   
d.	 Parking requirements may be reduced or relaxed where development use integrates transportation demand management measures.   
e. Parking regulations and user pricing should be used by Administration to support active modes of transportation and transit as viable and attractive mobility options.   
f. Provision of vehicle parking infrastructure should not inhibit desired built form outcomes.  

# Guide for Local Area Planning 3.13 Parking Policies  

g.	 Development should provide transportation demand management measures to support the achievement of a desired built form outcome, including, but not limited to:  

i.	 bicycle parking stalls beyond required minimums;   
ii.	 bicycle lockers or higher quality designed bicycle storage facilities;   
iii.	 bicycle repair facilities;   
iv.	 dedicated vehicle parking stalls for car-sharing services; and,   
v.	 active transportation supportive amenities, such as showers and change facilities.  

h.	 Where surface parking is provided, it should:  

i.	 be located behind or at the side of a building;   
ii.	 include pedestrian routes and landscaped areas to minimize visual and environmental impacts; and,   
iii.	 support adaptive reuse or temporary use of space, such as parking for food trucks.  

i. Above-grade parking structures should:  

i.	 be integrated into developments to minimize their visual impacts on the street;   
ii.	 identify opportunities to incorporate commercial, residential and office uses on the ground floor; and,   
iii.	 consider designs that support future adaptive reuse through strategies such as flat decks and floor-to-ceiling heights that allow for a range of uses.   
j.	 Shared use of parking facilities between developments should be encouraged to maximize the use of existing parking facilities.   
k.	 Where developments propose vehicle parking relaxations, consideration should be given to the policies, amenities and infrastructure identified in Chapter 3 and Appendix A of this Plan.  

# 2.7.5 Street Network  

The street network is an important part of the public realm and should provide functional, safe and efficient connections throughout the city to support a range of mobility options.  

# Policy  

a. Streets in residential or commercial areas should be designed to be safe, accessible and inclusive of all mobility users by incorporating: i.	 pedestrian routes; ii.	 cycling infrastructure; and, iii.	 other improvements and upgrades, where identified by in this Plan or other applicable City policy or strategy.   
b. New public or internal publicly-accessible private streets are encouraged where connections are missing in a community.   
c.	 Street furniture and publicly-accessible amenity spaces, such as plazas, should be incorporated into the design of higher activity streets.   
d. Streets in industrial areas should be designed to facilitate efficient large vehicle, equipment and goods movement and connections to regional corridors.

# 3.1 Overview  

The individual communities that make up the North Hill Communities share common amenities, services, parks and open spaces and public facilities; however, no single community has the amenities and services to provide for all the daily needs of residents. Communities depend on their interconnectedness, whether those are commercial amenities and services located on the area’s Main Streets and Activity Centres, or recreation opportunities in places like the Renfrew Aquatic & Recreation Centre and the network of multi-use pathways that surround and weave through the communities. This chapter sets out the goals and objectives for current and future amenities and infrastructure related to the vision identified in Chapter 1: Visualizing Growth.  

![](images/3cd54733dbfb2e7492d63168e2a45b3fcc97c4ca5b053d4ab7b7ae9b491f50fe.jpg)  

This chapter identifies local area plan specific objective and implementation options for supporting growth. Section 3.2 of this Plan identifies high-level goals that align with key planning direction provided within the MDP and includes locally specific objectives that support the Plan’s vision. The goals and objectives are long-term and are connected to the time horizon of the Plan. The objectives represent the future or desired result that this Plan commits to achieve. They apply community-wide, as they are not site-specific and provide benefit to more than one resident. The objectives are intended to be actionable.  

This chapter identifies implementation options related to the goals and objectives that recognize unique opportunities for placemaking, public realm improvements, enhanced mobility choices and enhancement of the urban forest. Appendix A includes a list of additional implementation options that stakeholders identified through the development of the plan. These implementation options are examples of actions that could be taken by The City of Calgary, developers, Business Improvement Associations and residents to future the individual goals and objectives in this chapter.  

This chapter provides high-level, strategic direction to inform investment decisions. Further detailed analysis and study for each option identified will be required and include engagement with area stakeholders (e.g., residents, community associations, business improvement areas, landowners, industry) as appropriate. The options in this chapter are statutory, while the ones identified in Appendix A are non-statutory.  

To support communities within the Plan through growth and change, the suggested options identified in this chapter and in Appendix A can help inform future City business plans and budget decisions. As growth occurs in local areas, these suggested options should be regularly reviewed and updated to determine if they help manage growth related pressures that a community may experience, ensuring growth can benefit current and future residents and businesses. There are several considerations for determining if an action merits inclusion in future business plans and budgets, including:  

the current status of infrastructure   
and amenities in the local area;   
the desired service and activity   
levels in the local area;   
the roles of different city builders in supporting the delivery of infrastructure and amenities; how the growth in this local area compares with city-wide growth and investment needs; The City’s corporate investment priorities   
and budget availability; and,   
the availability and use of appropriate planning and financial tools to support implementation.  

# 3.2 Goals, Objectives and Implementation Options  

This Plan identifies four goals that are intended to frame and provide guidance to support the Plan’s vision. These goals are broad and high-level, are common across all areas of the city and are aligned with direction from the MDP.  

# 3.2.1 Creating Great Communities  

Creating great communities by maintaining highquality living and working environments, improving housing diversity and choice, enhancing community character and distinctiveness and providing vibrant public places are key goals set out in the MDP. In the local area context, this means supporting the Plan vision through investing in affordable housing and care facilities, enhancing community character and vitality, encouraging the protection of local heritage resources, promoting public art and maintaining and investing in parks, open spaces and civic facilities.  

![](images/a20a81e9bab7e4e31d57fa807ec19d5d10b495a9e1da0fd66817ff42dedfb5a1.jpg)  

# Objectives  

The following objectives are intended to guide decisions for supporting growth and Creating Great Communities in the North Hill Communities.  

Celebrate, care for and, where appropriate, protect the heritage of the North Hill Communities. Recognize and support community identity and character through investment in public and private space including community beautification, signage, wayfinding and public art. Ensure residents of North Hill communities have access to a variety of public spaces in which to create and develop social connections with their neighbours. Improve safety and comfort in existing parks and open spaces and, where feasible, support a broader range of complementary uses that cater to diverse groups of users during all seasons. Improve and enhance existing civic facilities. Provide accessible and affordable housing choices to accommodate diversity among people, ages, incomes, tenures and household types.  

# Implementation Options  

The following are intended to identify actions to achieve the supporting growth objectives:  

![](images/e630a853726afd80452105d2b1f56140daeb9c65aa3811f59769815113e87fe8.jpg)  

![](images/5907cb1a9fa6f66f8135d8a6f232f790cfe8ac07afb02cb57cd8b648660b260b.jpg)  

# Community Facilities and Spaces  

a.	 There are many community facilities and spaces across the North Hill Communities including schools, community associations, pools, recreation centres, arts centres, civic partner facilities and parks. Together, these community facilities and spaces are places where residents gather, celebrate, learn and play. Continued support and investment in these facilities is necessary to allow them to continue to thrive. To support future investment in community facilities and spaces, the following should be considered, where feasible:  

i.	 support the continued role and enjoyment of community facilities and spaces for all community members;   
ii.	 where appropriate, integrate civic uses into existing and new facilities and spaces to create multi-purpose and multi-use amenities;   
iii.	 optimize the network of facilities that serve community needs;   
iv.	 collaborate with residents, partners and other levels of government to deliver functional and sustainable facilities, spaces and programming that addresses community needs;   
$\mathsf{v}.$ encourage the integration of public facilities into the social fabric of the community through pathways, parks and active transportation corridors;   
vi.	 explore uses that promote year-round outdoor site activation (e.g., winter); and,   
vii.	enhance the functionality of community facilities and spaces through the inclusion of infrastructure such as lights, electricity, water and washrooms to allow for a range of accessible activities.  

# Affordable Housing  

b.	 Access to safe and stable housing helps create inclusive communities and adds to the overall health, prosperity and safety of our city. People in affordable housing have greater chances to find and keep jobs, to learn and build skills and be active participants in their communities. Affordable housing also helps boost the local economy through the creation of construction jobs.  

Housing vulnerable residents improves individual outcomes related to the social determinants of health and promotes self-sufficiency and builds equity in communities.  

The City of Calgary defines a household as in need of affordable housing if it spends 30 percent or more of its income on shelter and earns less than 65 percent of Calgary’s median household income. To improve access to affordable housing in the North Hill Communities, the following should be considered:  

i.	 enable inclusion of affordable housing units in new residential and mixed-use developments;   
ii.	 consider including affordable housing in the redevelopment of vacant land;   
iii.	 support the intensification, rehabilitation and retention of existing affordable housing developments, ensuring no net loss of units;   
iv.	 encourage strategic partnerships with private and public stakeholders to address unmet housing needs; and,   
$\mathsf{v}.$ support and encourage the development of affordable housing in areas that are well serviced by the Primary Transit Network and appropriate services including grocery stores and schools.

# Tuxedo Park and Tuxedo Park School Balmoral Circus/Beaumont Circus  

c. Tuxedo Park and the historic Tuxedo Park School have been an important community hub since the early 1900s. Built in 1920, the Tuxedo Park School was occupied until 2014 and is a good and unique example of Arts & Crafts architecture. While the Tuxedo Park School is not a legally protected heritage building, it is listed on the Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources and City policy encourages for creative and adaptive reuse of Cityowned heritage buildings. The surrounding park space has been a place where the community has and continues to recreate. The following should be considered for any future redevelopment of Tuxedo Park and the Tuxedo Park School site:  

i.	 undertake a comprehensive review of site design and programming to ensure Tuxedo Park addresses the adjacent future Green Line LRT station;   
ii.	 preserve and encourage adaptive reuse of the Tuxedo Park School building with minimal impacts on the historic resource;   
iii.	 provide a pedestrian friendly public realm interface with the future Green Line LRT Station, on Centre Street N;   
iv.	 improve the quality and variety of the park amenities and playground equipment; and,   
$\mathsf{v}.$ provide affordable housing.  

d.	 Balmoral Circus and Beaumont Circus, the only two known circuses in the city, were influenced by the City Beautiful Movement. This movement promoted urban beautification, monumental grandeur and formality to encourage order and harmony. Historically, careful attention was given to the landscaping of these formal and geometric circuses with the objective of encouraging public enjoyment and activity. Today, these spaces serve primarily a mobility function as their floral arrangements and elaborate landscaping have long been removed.  

To encourage increased pedestrian activity and public use, these spaces should be open and accessible to people of all ages and encourage a sense of place. The following should be considered:  

i.	 convert roadway to park space within the circuses; and,   
ii.	 improve comfort and safety for park users and active transportation modes.

# Confederation Park  

e. Confederation Park was created to celebrate Canada’s Centennial in 1967. The park was envisioned as a naturalized public space, supporting unstructured activities and environmental preservation. One of its most distinguishable features is the park’s carefully moulded and sculpted topography, which is oriented around the naturally occurring stream and coulee. Today, the space provides the public with both active and passive recreational opportunities. To support the continued vitality of Confederation Park, the following should be considered:  

i.	 design and provide infrastructure within the park that supports activity during all seasons, including winter;   
ii.	 improve accessibility for all users of all ages and abilities;   
iii.	 improve the types and variety of activities available to parks users;   
iv.	 encourage complimentary uses, where appropriate, adjacent to Confederation Park; and,   
$\mathsf{v}.$ improve connectivity with adjacent communities.  

# McHugh Bluff and Crescent Heights Park  

f.	 McHugh Bluff spans two North Hill Communities – Crescent Heights and Rosedale. The bluff is named after Felix McHugh, who homesteaded this property and was a prominent and early entrepreneur in Calgary. Due to its’ steep topography the bluff has remained largely undeveloped and in a natural state. Today, McHugh Bluff and the adjacent Crescent Heights Park, with their dramatic views of Downtown, make this landscape feature and the surrounding area a popular place to live, play and enjoy. To improve safety, accessibility and enjoyment of this important local and regional open space for all users, the following should be considered, where feasible:  

i.	 provide additional lighting, seating and street furniture;   
ii.	 consider a greater variety of activating uses that may include small-scale commercial amenities (e.g., small restaurant or café);   
iii.	 enhance connectivity to the larger mobility network and Crescent Heights Park; and,   
iv.	 improve maintenance and waste collection.  

# 3.2.2 Realizing Excellence In Urban Design  

![](images/54a081c6ac58677e254f089c8030a5aa4c3da0a3f8bdcaff7bea6c695424b49b.jpg)  

Making Calgary a livable, attractive, memorable and functional city is an important goal of the MDP. At the local area level, this means ensuring excellence in urban design in the public realm, particularly in areas with high-levels of activity such as Main Streets, transit station areas and Activity Centres.  

# Objectives  

The following objective is intended to guide decisions for supporting growth and Realizing Excellence in Urban Design in the North Hill Communities.  

Improve the quality of the pedestrian realm along Main Streets, transit station areas and Activity Centres.  

# Implementation Options  

The following are intended to identify actions to achieve the supporting growth objectives:  

# Main Streets Streetscape Improvements  

The North Hill Communities Plan Area has four Main Streets: Centre Street N, Edmonton Trail NE, 16 Avenue N and 4 Street NW. These Main Streets are often at the heart of communities, form the border between communities and provide many of the primary transit routes, including the future Green Line LRT. Calgary’s Main Streets are vibrant by design and often allow for a wider variety of uses and mixed housing options, to support higher density of development necessary to support that variety of uses. To reach their full potential, Calgary’s Main Streets need both public and private investment with the shared goal of giving residents the choice to travel less and live more by providing the things they need right in their own communities. Coordinated design will support the efficient use of investment by reducing the need to reconstruct the public realm as redevelopment occurs, provide a safe public realm space that is accessible (e.g., through consistent materials, predictable placement of streetscape elements) and improve the public realm in a phased approach that will add to the vibrancy of a Main Street. To support Main Streets in the North Hill Communities, the following should be considered:  

i.	 improve the quality of the public realm and accessibility of Main Streets through streetscape improvements;   
ii.	 undertake streetscape master plans that are designed to support the activity levels envisioned in this Plan and ensure construction is undertaken in a coordinated fashion;   
iii.	 create Main Streets that are attractive and visually appealing; and,   
iv.	 provide an enhanced public realm that prioritizes the creation of comfortable spaces for people to sit, gather, enjoy and walk.  

# 3.2.3 Connecting The City  

![](images/f4bd82692d7a7874abc9ed22c54e39743df659116d625d6d9b4af6c98df59629.jpg)  

Creating and supporting an integrated, multi-modal transportation system that supports land use and promotes vibrant and connected communities is another important goal at both the MDP and local area level. In the North Hill Communities context, it means promoting increased mobility choices and active living with a greater emphasis on walking, cycling and transit use, as well as improving connections between and within communities.  

# Implementation Options  

The following are intended to identify actions to achieve the supporting growth objectives:  

# Green Line LRT  

a.	 The Green Line LRT has been planned since the 1980s. Originally proposed as a transit way, this significant piece of transit infrastructure will connect the North Hill Communities to Downtown and the rest of Calgary. The approved northern route for the Green Line LRT will head north from Downtown along Centre Street N with four stations proposed within the North Hill Communities. The four Green Line LRT Stations planned for the North Hill Communities Plan area are:  9 Avenue N, 16 Avenue N, 28 Avenue N and 40 Avenue N. When completed, the Green Line LRT will serve tens of thousands of transit users every day. To best serve the North Hill Communities, the following should be considered:  

# Objectives  

The following objectives are intended to guide decisions for supporting growth and Connecting the City in the North Hill Communities  

Improve pedestrian and cycling connections and complete missing links between Main Streets, transit station areas, Activity Centres, community association sites, parks and natural areas.   
Improve transit inside and outside of   
the North Hill Communities.   
Improve safety, connectivity and accessibility   
for all modes of transportation.   
Improve the quality of the public realm on   
local neighbourhood streets to make them   
pleasant places for walking and playing.   
i.	 improve the streetscape and public realm along Centre Street;   
ii.	 implement, improve or support pedestrian friendly and transit-friendly urban design;   
iii.	 improve connections to the city-wide transit network, including BRT;   
iv.	 improve connections to the city-wide pedestrian and cycling network;   
$\mathsf{v}.$ support transit supportive uses and intensities; and,   
vi.	 coordinate public realm improvements with Main Streets streetscape improvements.  

![](images/a0c9368c4b03fc5884b307f247b8394bc1caad8884c0d437a1e4a16e7522d375.jpg)

# Improved Cycling and Pedestrian Connections  

b.	 Creating and supporting an integrated and complete multi-modal transportation network, including pathways and bikeways, is an important goal of this Plan and the Calgary Transportation Plan (CTP). The Always Available for All Ages & Abilities (5A) Network identified in the CTP intends to improve safety and create improved pathway and bikeway connections across the city. Appendix C of this Plan shows the 5A Network in the North Hill Communities area. To improve overall pedestrian and cyclist connectivity and safety, the following should be considered:  

i.	 provide comprehensive and complete east/ west and north/south cycling connections across the North Hill Communities including:  

A.	 improved connectivity between the North Hill Communities and major amenities post-secondary intuitions such as the University of Calgary and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT); and,   
B.	 improved cycling connections to parks and open spaces within the North Hill Communities such as Confederation Park, Nose Creek and McHugh Bluff.   
ii.	 implement traffic calming measures that support safe and comfortable pedestrian and cycling within the North Hill Communities;   
iii.	 improve pedestrian and cycling connections to Greenview Industrial and the Nose Creek regional pathway; and,   
iv.	 improve connectivity between the North Hill Communities and the residential communities and employment areas east of Deerfoot Trail.  

# Mobility Studies and Policy Updates  

c.	 The City is currently undertaking several mobility studies and policy updates for how Calgarians move throughout the city. Recognizing that this work is underway, the Plan will be updated to align with the Calgary Transportation Plan, the Green Line North Mobility Study and any recommendations/outcomes from the Notice of Motion bylaw setback review to support the vision of this Plan. The following should be considered:  

i.	 identify the role, function, standards and potential interim uses for road rights-ofway with a focus on those streets that have road rights-of-way setbacks;   
ii.	 allow on-street parking on Main Streets and in Activity Centres with a focus on areas identified as Active Frontage;   
iii.	 integrate public transit operations with other forms of mobility; and,   
iv.	 optimize of existing infrastructure to accommodate alternative and future mobility.  

# 3.2.4 Greening The City  

![](images/5d69cb27c40e1dcaa601bd1309c0bff00d3531ca243caa41aa26aba1b1ea69b0.jpg)  

Conserving, protecting, maintaining and restoring the natural environment is the final key goal of this Plan. At the local level the natural environment begins when a person steps out their door, with trees, possibly providing habitat, on private lots and in the boulevard. The tree canopy within the North Hill Communities is well established and thus protection and maintenance of trees on both public and private lands is a priority. This environment then extends along green boulevards and eventually connects to the network of parks and natural areas which include riparian areas, Nose Creek, escarpments and other features which contribute to ecological health and a sense of personal well-being within the Plan area.  

# Objectives  

The following objectives are intended to guide decisions for supporting growth and Greening the City in the North Hill Communities.  

Protect, maintain and enhance the tree canopy on public and private lands throughout the plan area. Support the planting of trees using methods that will ensure the sustainability and longevity of new trees to reach full canopy size. Protect, maintain and enhance riparian areas along the creeks to facilitate wildlife movement, biodiversity and creek health while improving resilience to erosion, flooding and water quality impacts.  

# Implementation Options  

The following are intended to identify specific actions to achieve the supporting growth objectives:  

# Urban Forest  

a.	 Calgary’s urban forests provide important ecosystem functions including improving air quality, reducing stormwater runoff, providing shade and cooling, wildlife habitats and creating stress-reducing environments for residents. The MDP recognizes the importance of the urban forest and identifies a tree canopy coverage target of $14-20\%$ across the city. Over the last ten years, the North Hill Communities have experienced a slight decrease in overall canopy coverage and currently sits at $15\%$ .  

To achieve and maintain a healthy, sustainable urban forest and meet tree canopy targets, it is critical that The City, developers and residents contribute to consistent and continuing urban forest management by protecting existing private and public trees wherever possible, planting the right trees in the right location and in the right way and maintaining all trees in good health. This Plan establishes a tree canopy coverage target for the North Hill Communities of $16.5\%$ by 2030. To meet this target, the following actions should be implemented (in addition to the general policies in Chapter 2):  

i.	 protect trees on public and private lands wherever possible from removal due to development, root impact due to construction or other activities and unnecessary canopy pruning;   
ii.	 provide additional tree plantings in public boulevards and ensure sustainable planting infrastructure, sufficient soil volume and adequate moisture particularly on arterial and commercial roads for large canopy growth in the long-term;   
iii.	 create tree planting programs for private lands;   
iv.	 protect, maintain and enhance the ordered, regular planting design in heritage boulevards; and,  

v.	 invest in ongoing maintenance and lifecycle of public trees.

# 4.2 Local Area Plan Interpretation  

# Map Interpretation  

a.	 Unless otherwise specified in this Plan, the boundaries or locations of any symbols or areas shown on a map are approximate only, not absolute and will be interpreted as such. The maps are not intended to define exact locations except where they coincide with clearly recognizable physical features or fixed boundaries such as property lines, roads or utility rights-of-way. The precise location of these boundaries, for the purpose of evaluating development proposals, will be determined by the approving authority at the time of application.  

b.	 No measurements of distances or areas should be taken from the maps in this Plan.  

c.	 All proposed urban form areas, additional policy guidance, building scale, road and utility alignments and classifications may be subject to further study and may be further delineated at the outline plan or land use amendment stage in accordance with applicable policies. Any major changes may require an amendment to this Plan.  

d.	 Any change to the text or maps within this Plan shall require an amendment to the Plan that includes a Public Hearing of Council.  

# Policy interpretation  

e.	 The South Saskatchewan Regional Plan (SSRP) establishes a long-term vision for the region using a cumulative effects management approach to guide local decision-makers in land use and watershed management to achieve Alberta’s economic, environmental and social goals. This Plan allows The City to encourage and incentivize more progressive policies related to sustainability and the environment.  

f.	 Where an intent statement accompanies a policy, it is provided as information only to illustrate the intent and enhance the understanding of the subsequent policies. If an inconsistency arises between the intent statement and a policy, the policy will take precedence.  

g.	 The word “should” is explicitly used to further clarify the directional nature of the statement. Policies that use active tense or “should” are to be applied in all situations, unless it can be clearly demonstrated to the satisfaction of The City that the policy is not reasonable, practical or feasible in a given situation. Proposed alternatives will comply with MDP and CTP policies, intent and guidelines to the satisfaction of The City with regard to design and performance standards.  

h.	 Policies that use the words “shall,” “will,” “must” or “require” apply to all situations, without exception, usually in relation to a statement of action, legislative direction or situations where a desired result is required.  

i.	 All illustrations and photos are intended to illustrate concepts included in the Plan and are not exact representations of an actual intended development. They are included solely as examples of what might occur after implementation of this Plan’s policies and guidelines. Updates to the illustrations do not require a Public Hearing of Council.  

# Figure Interpretation  

j.	 Unless otherwise specified within this Plan, the boundaries or locations of any symbols or areas shown on a figure are approximate only, not absolute and shall be interpreted as such. Figures are not intended to define exact locations except where they coincide with clearly recognizable physical features or fixed boundaries such as property lines or road or utility rights-of-way.  

k.	 Unless otherwise specified within this Plan, where actual quantities or numerical standards are contained within the figure, these quantities or standards shall be interpreted as conceptual only and will be determined at the detailed design stage.  

# Appendix Interpretation  

The appendices do not form part of the statutory portion of this Plan. The intent of the appendices is to provide information and guidelines to support the policies of this Plan.  

# Plan Limitations  

m.	 Policies and guidelines in this plan are not to be interpreted as an approval for a use on a specific site. No representation is made herein that any particular site is suitable for a particular purpose. Detailed site conditions or constraints must be assessed on a case-by-case basis as part of an outline plan, land use amendment, subdivision or development permit application.  

# Existing Caveats/Restrictive Covenants  

n.	 Some parcels in the plan area may have caveats registered against the certificate of title which may restrict development. These restrictions may include, but are not limited to, restricting development to one or two-unit dwellings. In some cases the caveats may not be in alignment with the goals and objectives of this Plan and where such conflicts occur, The City of Calgary supports the direction of this Plan.  It is the responsibility of landowners to have caveats discharged from their land title certificate.

Transit Station Area – the area surrounding a transit station along a primary transit line, such as a Light Rail Transit or Bus Rapid Transit route, that includes enhanced amenities.  

Transition Zone – the area that extends from the outer edge of the core zone up to an additional 300 metres and provides a transition of form and activities between the core zone and the surrounding community as identified in the Plan.  

Transportation Demand Management (TDM) – programs, services and products to encourage a shift in travel behaviour from single-occupant automobiles to more sustainable modes of travel, including walking, cycling, transit, car sharing and carpooling. Examples of TDM measures include changing the time of day people travel, parking spaces allocated for carpooling or car sharing and enhanced bicycle stalls and facilities.  

Work-Live Units – units designed to be used as a dwelling unit or commercial space concurrently or separately, offering flexibility and a more direct relationship to the public realm (e.g. sidewalks) than traditional dwelling units. These spaces are designed to be highly flexible and adaptable in design and allow for a variety of professional and commercial uses such as markets, artists’ studios, instructional facilities, consulting firms, or artisanal production spaces.

# Appendix A: Implementation Options  

In addition to the implementation options provided in Chapter 3, the following implementation actions have been identified by stakeholders through a series of public engagements conducted during the drafting of this Plan. As noted in Chapter 3, these actions represent steps community stakeholders identified to achieve the supporting growth objectives of the Plan. This Appendix is non-statutory and is intended to be revised over time as local growth occurs, actions are evaluated or completed and/or new options are identified through subsequent stakeholder engagement and City departmental prioritization. As a non-statutory part of the Plan, updates to this Appendix do not require a Public Hearing of Council.

# Appendix C: Mobility  

Map C1: Pedestrian Corridors and Map C2: Cycling Network identify existing pedestrian and cycling mobility connections and recommended mobility improvements within and surrounding the North Hill Communities. The maps are based on, but also inform, The Always Available for All Ages & Abilities (5A) Map of the Calgary Transportation Plan (CTP) and show existing and recommended connections identified in the CTP at the local area plan level.  

Improvements to the mobility network will prioritize pedestrians and cyclists where possible, by providing accessible pathway and bikeway connections between the communities and to local and regional destinations. This includes supporting the Future Growth Concept with appropriate facilities in the public right-of-way. Improvements identified on Maps C1 and C2 will take time and will be phased as budget allows, subject to technical feasibility. This map is intended to compliment and inform the implementation options identified in Section 3.2.3 Connecting the City as well as future mobility improvements and investment.  

The recommended pedestrian corridors depicted on Map C1: Pedestrian Corridors inform specific streets where an enhanced pedestrian realm space is desired.  An enhanced pedestrian realm may include elements such as wider sidewalks, furniture zones, seating, plantings and other features that support the envisioned street activity and the Future Growth Concept.  All other streets, without the recommended pedestrian corridor designation, will still provide standard residential sidewalks to create a  complete walking network.  

The recommended cycling network conceptually shown on Map C2: Cycling Network identifies corridors, not specific streets. The map is not intended to make any recommendation about the specific type of cycling connection that would be built, but rather the conceptual locations for those connections.  The Future Growth Concept and existing right-of-way space will be used to refine the location of the specific cycling connection and help determine the type of facility/infrastructure to be built.

# Appendix D: Constraints  

Map D: Constraints identifies development constraints that should be considered for development applications.   
Specific development constraints are summarized here.  

# Airport Vicinity Protection Area  

The Airport Vicinity Protection Area (AVPA) regulation governs development within the flight path of airplanes travelling to and from the Calgary International Airport to ensure land use compatibility. Noise exposure forecast (NEF) contours of the AVPA generally impact the eastern portion of the plan area, specifically Greenview Industrial. Properties within these areas are subject to certain development restrictions and/or conditions as identified in the regulation.  

# Freight Rail Corridor  

A Canadian Pacific (CP) rail corridor runs through the eastern part of the plan area. Any development adjacent to freight rail corridors must comply with the requirements of the Development Next to Freight Rail Corridors Policy, in addition to any other applicable policies.  

# Landfill Setback  

There is a non-operating landfill located to the south of the plan area in Bridgeland-Riverside. The Subdivision and Development Regulations prohibit specific uses such as hospitals, schools, residences and food establishments within a specified distance. See the Subdivision and Development Regulations for additional information.
