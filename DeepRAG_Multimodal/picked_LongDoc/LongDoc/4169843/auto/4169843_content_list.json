Copies of the NDR application documents can be found at www.resilientshelby.com Also, as described in the NDR Phase 2 application, both Memphis and Shelby County are committed to carrying out Fair Housing activities.  Shelby County’s Department of Housing, a partner team member in the NDR application, is the County agency operating HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) entitlement grants and oversees housing programs which directly impact LMI residents which include infrastructure development, housing rehabilitation/construction, down payment assistance, lead-based paint hazard reduction, CDBG Disaster Recovery activities, and fair housing counseling.  Likewise, the City of Memphis, a partner in the NDR application operates similar activities through its Division of Housing and Community Development.  Both agencies are currently working to promote Fair Housing and Fair Housing Initiatives under their Fair Housing Assessments.  Additionally, as part of the GREENPRINT, the Memphis Shelby County Office of Sustainability completed a Fair Housing Equity Assessment (FHEA) in partnership SCDH, HCD, community and business leaders and other housing partners and addressed fair housing impediments under the Greenprint and recommended various solutions to improve fair housing education and compliance.   Under the NDR grant, Shelby County will continue to promote and further Fair Housing utilizing the Shelby County Department of Housing, Memphis HCD, and the Greenprint’s FHEA to further assess Fair Housing impediments and incorporate Fair Housing initiatives into the NDR Resiliency Plan and the NDR projects in North (Big Creek), Central (Wolf River Greenway), and South (Cypress Creek) Shelby County.  Currently, efforts are underway by Memphis and Shelby County to develop a new AFH Plan under new Fair Housing guidelines by 2018 to more effectively carryout Fair Housing initiatives on a joint/countywide basis in order to more efficiently address fair housing issue.  The NDR administrative staff will work directly with SCDH, HCD, the Office of Sustainability to insure that Fair Housing is a key component of the NDR Resiliency Plan, long term resiliency efforts, and the long range Greenprint 2040 (which was the base platform for the NDR application in Phase 1 and Phase 2).  The NDR team understands that long term resiliency, social, economic, and environmental issues are a part of any long term Fair Housing Initiatives.  Through the activities of the NDR grant; and both Memphis and Shelby County’s HUD funded grants (CDBG, HOME, Lead Hazard Control, etc.) Shelby County will insure that fair housing is a central part of long term resilience efforts resulting from NDR efforts and projects.

Upon completion of the contracting process, the successful bidding contractor will be awarded the Phase 8 base upon the submitted bid of $\\$909$ ,440 and will be issued a Notice to proceed on construction of Phase 8. As for Phase 10A off the Greenway, this phase was still in the process of being finalized for bid release.  Some small design issues and the purchase of several easements were slowing the bidding of Phase 10A. This slight delay does not have an impact on the overall anticipated completion date of the entire Wolf River Wetland and Restoration Project. Phases 6, 7, and 10 are currently undergoing design review and cost analysis along with standard pre-bidding ",
