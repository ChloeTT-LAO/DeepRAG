The magician can play these souls like strings by using their true names - for daemons, this is a most joyful pastime. I have seen them cackle and cavort when they achieve it, though it does not always come easily. They train themselves to focus on one \"string\" in particular: the one between a person's soul and a Dark God, forged by pact and sealed on death. My experimental research suggests that even where no pact is made, this bond always exists as a potentiality, and its manipulation can produce dreadful results. According to the esteemed Prelate Jungfrau, among daemons these powers appear physically like swirling vortices of deep black tendrils that grasp tirelessly at their victims. ",

All three speak ofthe Immortal Realm as highly changeable and shaped by the will of its denizens - this is well known. But they also provide many references to visions generated by the maelstrom itself, claiming to have glimpsed things in this ocean of magic - historic and current events, as well as presumed images of the future. It is here that we find our answer to the problem of Divination. Daemons have spent eternity in a Realm where that which will come to pass can be read in the very substance ofthe land, for those with the skill to read it, or the patience to acquire such a skill.
