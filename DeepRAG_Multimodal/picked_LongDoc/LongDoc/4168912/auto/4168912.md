The Eightfold Testament  

# THE BOOK OF THE INFINITELEGIONS  

# The Ocean and the Rivers of Power  

The Father is the highest, the purest principle of this universe. Understanding his essence means achieving the power to manipulate reality and, therefore, dominate life. Where human and elven religion is nothing but spiritual weakness and decay, Father Chaos is the avatar of ultimate divinity from his realm beyond the Veil.  

Mastery of the Veil's full power is beyond any mortal. To overcome such earthly limits, the conjurer should negotiate   
with the higher spheres of the Le  
gions, the true embodiments   
of the Father, his seven   
names of power: Gods   
the foolish call Dark.  

And within them: a thousand over thousand nuances of power, each embodied in a principle, a smaller deity or supernal called daemon. Each a stream adding to a tributary - lesser daemons swept up in the flow of the greater, themselves joined to one of seven mighty rivers, and each river merging into the Father's unspeakable ocean of power. For a daemon's freedom and will is proportional to its power, and each strives eternally to command those below while gaining independence from those above.  

The conjurer's ambition, strength and willpower are the keys to the forbidden knowledge of the Veil. Forbidden to the weak, but a source of unspeakable glory for they who know their own mind. The conjurer who dares to walk such a path is called mad, evil, inhuman, but they do not hearken to the worthless slurs of the enslaved.  

While those Warriors following the Seven   
Flowers of Chaos strive to gain immortality gifted   
by approving gods, a conjurer achieves their   
power by negotiation and force of will. A true conjurer is more than a mere mortal, and the daemons are their company. Alone in the dark, they commune with the mysteries of the Seven Rivers of Knowledge, and their Infinite servants, who whisper at their ear of the terrible, wondrous possibilities behind the Veil.  

Many  are  the  glorious whisperers in the ocean of the  

Father and many are their forms and natures, for they are Legion. The mortal struggles to grasp the true meaning of Infinity, a holy word, and the incautious conjurer may be undone by the Legions' sheer diversity and scope. Their shapes are endless, from liquid darkness to creatures of pure sensation, from incarnations of the deepest mortal desire to the worst nightmare, from common beasts to unspeakable and disgusting masses of rotting flesh and blood. Each form fascinating and unique, troubling and sublime.  

The words I hereby present are the Gospel of the Seven Names themselves, the instructions to acquire their powers, to conjure their servitors, to comprehend the Veil and to conquer the Earth. Beware, for death awaits the weak, and failure brings madness, self-destruction and unimaginable sufferings.  

# The Ways of Entering and Leaving  

There are three ways that a daemon may enter the Mortal Realm.  

The first is the Way of Nature. As the currents of magic flow around our world, so the Veil thins in some places over time, and in rare instances, becomes so weakened that the waiting Legions can push through of their own choosing. Hence we see the sudden appearance of beasts or armies, especially in times of natural turmoil, following storms or wildfires - though the Mother quickly repairs her Veil after such events. Daemons loosed in such a fashion are freed upon the world, and a dangerous proposition for a conjurer seeking aid. Many are the ignorant who, not knowing that daemons are sent by the Seven and the Father, have come to believe them a natural disaster akin to disease and famine, even supposing they are a scourge or punishment sent by their own gods.  

The second is the way of Summoning. This is the Way of the conjurer, for a ritual correctly made can form a channel for a daemon to pass the Veil, to be set upon its own path until its magical sustenance is exhausted. Such daemons can be called to bargain with the conjurer for power or knowledge, or even bound by the strongest and shackled to their will.  

![](images/5cb27310a9413169733332e25519f7e7d2bb611bb4e60452e4d75c04945bff21.jpg)  

Such dealing is fraught with peril for a mortal mind, for daemons are fickle and devious, and seek to undo ambition by its own folly. But a successful negotiation is worth any risk for a determined conjurer.  

To summon a daemon ofthe Legions, from a prince to the lowest soldier, three elements are crucial. First, the call of a summoner certain and resolute of heart. Many are the incantations and ritual practices used by conjurers to clear their minds and welcome the Father's servants. The only indispensable component of such practices is the sincerity of will with which the ritual is conducted. Second, the provision of raw resources with which a daemon can construct its physical form in the process of materialisation. Brimstone is the most common and important element, but others can be supplied at the summoner's discretion - though  

only the purest materials are likely to affect the form taken. Third, and most crucial of all, a sacrifice should be performed to grant the energy necessary for the daemon to manifest. The higher the status of the victim, the more tempting and gratifying to a potential summon  

ing. Lords and nobles, alchemists and thaumaturges give access to most powerful spirits beyond the Veil. But any sacrifice is sufficient for a simple ritual, provided it is a sentient being capable of true fear, awe and madness. For it is terror that is the call for a daemon to follow.  

Massive sacrifices for the glory of the Legions, such as a whole battlefield of corpses, are naturally the highest form of offering, granting the attention of the most powerful princes, heralds and dukes, along with their retinues. If such an operation should be conducted where the Veil is already thin, an entire army could be conjured.  

Beware, for even a small daemonic battalion with a greater daemon at its head is an unendurable ordeal for the unprepared, a jump into permanent madness for some - but a vision of splendour for the superior conjurer. Whole armies of trained soldiers have fled at the mere sight of such a force - and yet larger daemonic incursions are inherently limited by the quantities of raw magic they require to sustain their existence within this realm. For no daemon can endure here when the magic resources of its environment are spent. A full army of daemons can rarely last longer than a few cycles of the sun - but oh, whatit can achieve in such a time!  

Finally, the third Way is that of Possession. Whether summoned or naturally arriv  
ing, a daemon can sometimes   
seek - or be compelled - to  

enter a body already existing in our realm, instead of creating its own. It may be a person or an object, as in the stories of daemonic weapons that speak to and influence their bearer. In possession, a daemon requires much less magic to continue its existence in the mortal realm, often residing undetected for years or decades.  

These, then, are the three ways of entering. So too are there three ways of leaving. Either the daemon depletes its magic, or it is intentionally exorcised by a conjurer, or its manifested body is slain by a warrior. In each case, the daemon itself returns across the Veil against its will, and it cannot walk again into the material world until it has recovered enough energy. For incarnation is as costly to a daemon as it is rewarding. Its phys. ical form is left within our Realm - the remains often toxic, and prone to rapid decomposition.

There is a fourth Way to destroy a daemon, and it is a heinous Way the details of which I will not disclose in these pages. But there are in this world certain methods and powers - rare and poorly understood - capable of ending not just a daemon's body but its very spirit, so that it is gone forever and in every Realm.  

# Chaos Ineffable  

We do not know for sure why the forces of the   
Dark Gods seek to enter our world, for the inter  
pretation of Chaos is far from unambiguous. Ever empt to follow the will and spread the   
word of the Seven Flowers, itself a mysterious   
and changeable gospel, and to encourage mortals in the practice of the Seven Living Vices that they hold dear. But equally the Legions often seem to pursue bloodshed, discord and destruction for no clear purpose - perhaps it amuses them, or they delight in all things random, fearful and chaotic. One clear goal often stated is simply the uction of orderly societies,  

unacceptable in the eyes of the Father and the undermining of social structures and systems of power wherever they are encountered. Greatest of these, of course, are the great nations of the mortal races, against which the Dark Gods are forever locked in struggle.

'Twas in the third year of the reign of our liege that I set mineself upon the Questing Path. I followed custom, and sought out a foe of legendary puissance to vanquish in the name of the Lady, the King, and our beloved realm. The prey I hadst selected was the Daemon Knight Atmok, champion of a glade in a far away land where the Veil was thin, who had laid forth verily a challenge: duel him, and win the blade of white gold from upon the stone. I laughed at this pitiable bribe as I set upon mine quest; neither wealth nor mystical trinkets had any claim upon my soul. I am a Knight of Equitaine; slay. ing the enemies of the Lady is its own reward.  

The dusky moors and   
wild  forests  presented   
some scant challenge, but none   
that could surpass mine skill. Thus I   
came to the blasted clearing of Atmok.   
The trees were felled clear, cloven by the blade of the daemon. The ground was black with the ichorous ruin of many a bold challenger. Death dwelt in the breeze, and all was silent in the glade where no beast nor fowl dared tread.  

"Daemon," I cried, spying my foe. “Daemon, thou art trespassing in these sacred woods! By the Lady, thou shalt perish!" And with that cry upon my lips, I charged.  

![](images/faa654ffe5956296750f318da2556aac09489ecac59df0cae96ee15033f51417.jpg)  

Mine was the initiative. Mightily I struck, shielding mine approach with the crest of my forefathers, and for moments, I thought the battle o'er swiftly. But I had not felled my foe; his blade had caught an angle, deflecting my stroke and leaving my guard weakened. Ne'ertheless, I was saved; brilliant light swept from my pendant, and the counter-stroke endangered my life no longer.  

Blow for blow we went, but e'er I was overmatched and saved by grace, not ability. The Daemon Knight possessed skill most surpassing, and I could not match him. In one final, desperate pass I mustered all mine strength - and the demon struck the blade from my hand with a flick of his wrist. Grace or not, I knew mine life was his to take, my body desecrated with ichor like the chalngers before me. Long moments passed.  

Then, at last, he spoke.  

"Passable" said he. "Caravanchian overtones, yet exhibiting a fine guard. You have some potential. Study the blade in earnest, and we will duel again."  

This mercy struck me harder than his weapon ever could. My quest was but a game to this veilspawn, my life a prize he did not desire. Upon my knees, I crawled away in shame.  

Other foes did I dispatch, but ne'er did I forget the Daemon Knight. A full cycle of seasons passed, and I could stand it no longer. I returned to the glade to face my vanquisher, hardened by battle and sharpened by will. No longer would I rely on the Lady's grace, trusting rather to my own valour and sturdy shield. I fought as fiercely I could, yet once again Atmok was the victor. Once again I was let loose into the world.  

Defeat I refused to know, and I redoubled mine training, and redoubled it again. I learnt the hammer from the Dwarves and the rapier from prelates of Reva. I swore I would let no trick of weaponcraft escape me, that ne'er again would my skill fail me. That none would be my better.  

To the dread forest I returned for the third time, confident once more, rebuilt from the defeat I had suffered in body and soul. Forgetting the oath I had already taken, I swore a new pact upon my sword: I would know victory for myself and none other The battle that rang out that day was testament to my training, a day of swordcraft and skill Worthy of the tongue of the greatest minstrel.  

I struck his blade from his hand. I pushed him back. I bellowed: "Thou art beaten, fiend! I am the better man!"  

Atmok laughed, and too late I recalled this was no man.  

"Thou dost laugh?" I inquired, in sudden hesitation.  

"I have won. Won you away from your weak goddess, and forged you into a worthy Knight of Pride. Look at your blade, apprentice."  

And even as he disarmed me with his dagger, I saw he was right. For the white gold sigil upon the sword spoke my heart's truth: that nothing mattered save my own prowess - and no mortal could instruct me better.  

And the light of the Morning Star filled mine heart.

I leapt forwards and downwards, oling behind the cuboid altr as a huge, sinous anm slashed at me from the shadows. A rar echoed allaround. Withot pausing, I actuated the miniaturised pistols uder ny sles and fed tWo shots into the thing that was charging me. It splt my ears with another below-this one caused by the pain from the abramelin ol with which I coated my anmunition. As it staggeed back into the beam of moonlight, I gosed. It was half mson and clovehoofd, at least sevnfet tal My min was ieditely fl wh memores of another night, long ago, and a sinilar appantion spied thrugh oleander blossoms.  

This beast was not the sane. The red steaks in its black hide wee the glow of helfire, which could be glinpsed inside when it opened its mouth. It was ta and lordly, bt not as heavily muscled as the minion of Vanadra that slew my mother Still it had more than sufcient power to lay low a batalion of inpenal infanty. I ralised that I had surprised it more than it me - or ese I would not have survived even as long as I had. I rgained my senses and immediately knew what must be done.

# Omen of Savar  

( have been studying the grimoire I rscued from Georges Sybellius corpse. Among the stains, tears and the sections that seem to writhe and puksate ( have found several legible passges on scraps of blackened parchment, descrbing the daenons he encountered in his over-enthusiastic career Though the writing betrays an unhealthy interest in the subect, much of the infommation seems very useful, and I will include some of his notes here along with the other extracts I am collcting in my wider investigations.

# August 33rd  

# Serember29th  

The sacrifice today mewled especially pitifully. I hurried the ritual, cutting the jugular with my golden knife. The room filled with a familiar vortex of magic, as the brimstone and other elements I provided were accepted up into my new-summoned creation, a Glory of Savar. Awesome and majestic. His great aura filled the room and I fell to my knees in thanks. Then he was gone - away into the city. I pray he noticed me.

# August 34th  

Yesterday's summoning was a serpent from the waist down. The one before had hooves and mighty wings. The only common element in each Glory is its blazing crown. I have seen how they struggle to impose their authority on each other when they come together Last month I was present when Savar's Omen came to us and compelled his lesser brethren to attack the temple. They had wanted to burn the barley crop instead, but their hands were forced by will alone. This is true leadership.  

I had to kill three of the livestock in the cellar. I have no more scraps to keep them alive while I wait for the brimstone that was promised several weeks ago.  

Tonight I hunted successfully for fresh stock. I caught one alone in a faeces-smeared alley near the cattle market. She didn't have time to scream before I had her The other I found unconscious behind a tavern. This city is so rotten that depraved wretches fall like spoiled fruit from an overladen tree.

# Tandemar 11th  

Glories attacked the palace yesterday. I read it in the Gazette. I wish I could have seen it as they fell upon the guards. The paper claimed that they failed to reach the inner chambers, but I know the truth. Now the sheep of this city will learn to fear the dutiful servants of Savar.

This city's degeneracy is a stench I cannot escape. I loathe it. So-called citizens who claim to love Sonnstahl spend their days inebriated and rutting in their own filth. Have they no dignity? No Pride?  

# November 1st  

I thought I saw men in dark uniforms following me down Copper Street. I turned into an alley and ran until I was sure they were gone. Hours have passed, and yet my heart still pounds.

# November24th  

Sacrifice tonight unsuccessful. Still not enough brimstone. I yearn to gaze upon a Glory once again. My failure is agonising.  

# Ullos 6th  

They are coming. They have found this house. I think I can see them through the curtains. They have taken Brother Huygen, I am sure of it. They do not show themselves to my eyes, but I can feel their gaze upon me.  

# Ullos 10th  

This room is dark all day. At night I venture into dirty streets, caged by soot-stained brick, wan lamps reflecting muddy puddles. The smell alone makes me retch. All ofit - it all needs to burn. And yet still they come for me.  

# Blazing Glory  

# Ullos 25th  

Oh Savar, my love for you burns like the flames of the Realm Beyond! Thank you, thank you for sending Brother Richemont to me before the end. His promise that I made you proud echoes in my heart for eternity. Accept me into your glorious presence but for a moment, I beg - unworthy as I am. By the edge of this golden knife, I give myself finally to you!  

-Parchments found on a corpse in an Aschau hovel m within the safety ofa village. It was quaint, and even now I stand by that first impression, although I recall a strange figure bustling away as I arrived, bent and hooded by a black cowl. Thinking little of it, I renteda room, and enjoyed the firstfeather mattress I had felt in weeks.  

![](images/bd03f4165de76a866c8af4f666e3e70cef1581b755a779091a89a42221eb6fa3.jpg)  

On the morn, I ventured out -   
my prize was the quiescis   
fola, whose petals are   
said to be a remedy   
against the shakes. Out  
side, I was met with an   
odd marking on the   
temple of the Lady, like a   
crudely rendered mural. A   
long, curved line with   
jagged   triangles   dispersec   
along its border like teeth. I dis  
missed the event as mere vandalism -  

bored youths trapped in their tiny village.  

I returned hours later with botanical samples to test. In my absence, a nobleman from Guenac had stopped with his retinue for the evening. He threw a feast for the town - no doubt a show of his own wealth and prestige. I joined in the celebration. Ale flowed freely, and the townspeople likely enjoyed one of the heartiest meals of their lives. I admit, with some embarrassment, that sobriety fled far from my mind that night.  

![](images/389b0c76ff7c70bc85d17c1a7e321fc3c1f2068bd0364ea088e2adf67265d870.jpg)  

I slumbered into the late afternoon of the fol  
lowing day, skull pounding like a drum. The noble   
was making preparations to leave. I planned to   
amend my hangover with breakfast, though I no  
ticed that the townsfolk were slaughtering live  
stock nearby. The image surprised me for a moment, as the cattle were surely vital to their  prosperity. Meats   were already being prepared, their savory smell reaching forward and pulling me to join by the nostrils.  

It is difficult to describe the hunger I felt. It was as if a beast lay within, gnawing at my soul to eat, eat, eat! I ate. So did the townsfolk. When the food at the tables grew thin, the cry nt up for more, and further slaughter followed. Within hours, not a single animal was left alive - not even the horses. Hounds were loosed to find rats, and then the dogs themselves were consumed.  

As the feast continued, the ale flowing like a torrent while food ran low, tension began to rise. One fellow shoved me to the floor, demanding that, as an outsider, I contribute my own share. I hurried away, but I felt his anger myself. Why was the food gone? The elders should be providing; I wanted to eat, needed to feed.  

Fights were broken up, and as the ale stopped flowing the folk dispersed to their homes, no doubt intent on raiding their own larders. I noticed some desperate fellows gorging themselves on horsefeed as I retreated to my room.  

On entering, I realised my mistake. The sample! Its petals were dry and brown. The plant had died exceptionally quickly, but there was nothing to blame but my own negligence. In addition, I realised sleeping would be difficult, what with the frequent shouting I heard from surrounding homesteads. Gathering my tools, I left eagerly under cover of night.  

My goal was to collect another sample, test it quickly, and get on my way. My quest was completed before noon, as I knew now where to look.  

Returning, I felt the stench before reaching the first house of the village. I could see 1 bodies, which didn't shock me so muc But the smell. Like spoiled seafood mixe with faeces. It was thick, almost a fog After clearing out the contents of my stomach on the road, I inspected a body closer It was rotten, as if it had been   
there for weeks. How had de   
composition taken hold so   
quickly? Now that I was   
closer, I could see the other   
townsfolk - crouching, bent   
figures consuming their pu  
trid companions, a devilish   
light in their eyes and a   
ruby stain on their lips.  

I rushed to grab my possessions, and left immediately. I passed the temple mural on my way out, seeping with fetid liquid, like puss from a wound, staining the walls of a once-holy sanctum. Walls that appeared to pulse - less stone now than flesh.  

It has been three days since I escaped that place. Still I sense its aroma of suffocating decay. The thought of food disgusts me. Every meal conjures the scene so vividly that I can't help but fear I am there again. I struggle to eat at all. May the saints preserve me.

barman wears tinted lenses to hide his eyes. On slow nights, if they tip well, he is known to amuse patrons with small feats of magic. The tavern is sought out for its tolerance, attracting every sort of customer - mercenary soldiers, religious pilgrims, seekers of fortune and knowledge. You'll find ogres and dwarves in there, and even the goblin-like duende, a native species that usually keeps to itself.  

The only people the barman will not serve are those suspected of affiliation with the Dark Gods. One night after a late-running town carnival (an almost daily occurrence in Destria), I was at the bar when an unremarkable couple ordered drinks. The barman, who calls himself Libron, was about to turn to the casks when he noticed small inked symbols under the newcomers' wrists. I saw his jovial expression turn to stone, and I thought there was a spark behind his dark glasses. He had them both dragged from the bar and taken straight to the authorities, where they admitted under questioning to working for a cult of Akaan.  

It was months later that the tavern was attacked by daemons. Corpulent, revolting insects the size of a man, flesh rotting from their fat bodies, hovering impossibly on tiny wings that filled the air with a deafening hum. The place was well-attended that night, and many of the patrons were armed. A terrible fight ensued, with the creatures proving as lethal as they were hideous. Each one that was felled by asword or club released streaks of black ichor over the unfortunate warrior who felled it, burning their flesh with a smell that made me retch as I hid under a table.  

Suddenly even this meagre shield was wrenched away and one of the hellish flies was upon me, stinger-first. I was certain of my doom, but at that moment Libron himself leapt out, covering my body with his own. I saw him remove his dark glasses, and a great bolt of searing fire seemed to speed from his very face, incinerating the oncoming daemon so completely that not even a drop of its poisonous innards touched the floor.  

His eyes were smoking as he replaced the bifocals. He dragged me to a back room and bolted the door. My mouth was agape. He fetched a pouch of purple-black powder and inhaled a thimbleful through his nose.  

Soon, troops arrived to despatch the last of the daemonic incursion. None but I had seen Libron's own daemonic powers.  

"This body is not my own," he confessed, breathing hard. He went on to explain that he was a being from the realm of the Dark Gods, who had possessed this man as a vessel many years earlier when he was summoned in a confrontation much like the one we had just survived. I was stunned by this revelation.  

He said he was in hiding - but not from people. In the Immortal Realm, where his formless mind had been exposed to the great mass of daemonkind, there was free will only according to his own strength.  

The greater daemons could compel their weaker brethren to do their bidding, and there was no way to resist. In the Mortal Realm, Libron found escape. The publican of Santa Genoveva was so pleased with the independence he discovered away from the Legions that he determined never to go back. This is a very unusual decision for a daemon to say the least, but for him freedom was more intoxicating than any of the beverages he served. He had even been able to source charged darkstone, which for years he had ground up and consumed to make sure he never exhausted the magic he needed to remain in this body.  

As I prepared to make my shaken way home, I turned to the man who was not a man.  

"I'm astonished," was all I could think to say.  

He smirked.  

"Do you think I'm the only one in this Realm?"

hutusda isolation of the Barren Mountains. Yet for all the weight of the iron chains binding me to my fellow prisoners, I knew it was lighter than the stone I would haul in the mines.  

The prisoner in front of me stul the line was forced to pause. Imn diately, the slavemasters were upon us. The  foreman raised his whip to punish the offender's weakness, but the stroke never came down. Instead, our captor gasped, and fell dead with an axe in his back. A large dark shape stood over him, and more were coming through the raised white dust. Men and women in huge armour: Warriors of the Dark Gc  

The other prisoners trembled in fear but I was elated. A true Warrior never kills a slave - they're more likely to set her free. My joy only grew when I saw the sign of Cibaresh etched on their chestplates.  

"You have come for me, I said, after they had slain the remaining guards. "We are allies under the Tempter, greatest of the Seven. I have not taken your pledge, but I have spent years in his service. Did you hear of the tentacled fiends un. leashed east of Avras? That was me!"

"We know who you are" said the warband's leader, dispassionately. "Follow"  

When I woke, I was alone under a grove of cedar trees on rich soil. The dust was gone from my body and I felt fresh and invigorated.  

"Abomination" came a voice like needles. I blinked as I saw Mother Safak from the convent step out from the trees. "You have succumbed to the sins of the flesh," she continued, “and the Goddess will cleanse you with holy fire from the inside out."  

I turned and there beside me was a man. His blue eyes gleamed from a face of radiant beauty, and I ran my fingers over a naked torso ridged with muscles like taught steel.  

I looked into those eyes for long minutes. I kept looking as I spoke again to the glaring figure of Mother Safak.  

"You must have followed me here after banishing me to a life of slavery. And still you seek to judge me. I do not remember being with this magnificent man - all I know is that I desire him with every atom of my body."  

I rolled over to straddle him. I felt the Mother Superior's eyes in my back as he took me. It made the pleasure burn with joyous rebellion.  

I looked down, and forced myself to see the real. ity I already knew to be true. This was no man, no Mother Safak, and there was no grove of cedars. The vision faded, and I was in a room of exotic drapes and rich incense. The thing beneath me was a daemon of purple skin and yellow cat's eyes. I smiled, and it purred back.  

"You passed the test, mortal. Pleasure with no shame. Cibaresh welcomes you here."  

The creature showed me the many delights of this haven beneath the mountains. There frolicked people of every different race and species, alongside a small number of visitors from the Immortal Realm. Those who were not in the throes of rapture seemed content, and peaceful.  

"I can stay here? This place is real?" I asked, feeling tears come to my eyes.  

"All we ask is that you spend a few months each year in the world outside, so that you can bring others to know the Tempter's joy. After that, this place is very real. It is yours to do with as you wish"  

So that is why I am here among you. To spread the good news of the Lord of Lust.  

We no longer have to fear the judgement of the gods. There is no reason to submit to a world that demands we reject our truest desires. We need not live entire lives without pleasure. All it takes is the courage to seize that which you want, and return the embrace of Cibaresh.

(n a certain tavern, I found a basement trapdoor that led to a forgotter catacomb. A dark and foreboding doorway was marked by a rough triangle on the lintel. I hefted a torch and passed through. (nmediately, I flt my skin pnckle with a strange fever. Something gleamed for an instant in the corner of my vision and I instinctiuely ducked and fired my wnst-pistol into the darkness.

cadthfy days of my youth. The company itself had just returned from a contract for the Republic of Santa Marika, and was recruiting heavily for its next campaign. It was there that I signed on. I chose it in part for its fame, and in part because of the great diversity of temperaments and peoples in its ranks. I was determined to test myself in whatever situations fortune would offer me, and among whichever peoples. Only then would I become the man who would be worthy of sweet Amelie's favour.  

This next campaign, it transpired, had been called in haste by the Protostratikon of Myra, to deal with the rebellion of a regional Kommis. Normally, this would have been handled without difficulty by the local forces, but according to survivors, the Kommis had made a pact with the Dark Powers. Myra's standing forces in the region were insufficient to the threat. Several settlements had been razed, and their peoples scattered by the time our ships landed.

When we met the enemy in the field, I was stationed with the reserve, set to aid whichever part of the line showed weakness.  

This a standard stratagem of the Iron Crowns, and sensible commanders everywhere. Our line was ready and the men grim as we awaited the clarion, but it was never to sound.  

A small force of the enemy had flanked our line entirely, moving faster than any company of horse. I say this as one who has seen the speed of elven knights first hand. These terrors of hellish tooth and claw tore into our ranks, their weapons alive, turning and cutting in ways no mortal blade could move. They would tease our troops out of position and proceed to cut them from every angle. To these assailants, it was all a blissful dance, flawlessly choreographed. The daemons writhed from partner to partner with flair and a practiced gait. Veterans of a score of battles, as tested as the steel in their hands, fell to these living nightmares. Wounded, yet living; the daemons wished to savour our downfall. They stayed their hands from killing if they could instead cripple. But worse still was the way they laughed throughout, like a courtesan's giggle, arousing and infuriating. Some dragged our fellows, noosed by neck and limb, to the rear ranks where their struggles ceased, and their bodies became a red ruin.  

How could I win out, when men such as these had failed and fallen?  

Their skill at arms unique. Their speed unmatchable. Any defence was futile against them - and in that, I found my salvation. I screamed and threw myself into the fray, surrendering thoughts of parry or dodge, simply swinging my halberd wildly. If I missed the foe, so be it, but I would not chase. I would not let myself be goaded or tricked. And my screams would banish the laughter and their whispers from the corners of my reason, insistent and unwelcome.  

This too would not have been enough but for the Captain's personal cavalry arriving to relieve us. Our regiment exhausted, and our standard lost, we were left in disgrace. I looked as though I had been dragged naked through a nettle bush. Worse than this, in the days that followed, I could not keep my mind from returning to images of those dreadful sirens and their impossible grace. For many months, at the sound of every laugh, my blood ran cold in memory of them.

that Pride is our greatest vice. And yet I

worth by that of others.  

Cudaleg: I did not ask for a history lesson, nor a lecture in darkest heresy. Come to the point, Doctor.  

Dalau: Of course. I merely wish my actions be understood. I was sent to these distant colonies by a jealous superior. He knew my skills would place his own career prospects in jeopardy. I was supposed to serve out the next century or so monitoring the health of humans and elves here in Sagarika. I did not mind. I have spent my time engaged in a fascinating study of disease. Humans here are among the most blighted by sickness of any in the world. But they do not blame their overcrowded cities nor their lack of sanitation and medical supplies. They blame the Dark Gods. According to their folklore, every sickness is sent by a daemon. This is nonsense, of course, but it is known that some daemons do carry diseases or even spread them intentionally. I wanted to see how far the Dark  

Gods really could be held responsible for the poor health of this sub-continent.  

ttle supernatural involvement until I began tigating one of the most extraordinary human diseases, which they call leprosy. This degenerative plague was not contagious to elves, though we have shunned its sufferers. I believe I am the first and only Highborn to have entered a leper colony. There I found the diseased humans openly worshipping Kuulima, safe in the knowledge that no one would come to stop them, and indeed I found evidence that daemons dwelt among them. It is only natural for the afflicted to envy the prosperity of others. The Lady of Flies teaches us that cultivating this feeling can lead to true greatness.  

Cudaleg: I repeat, we do not need to hear your apostasy. That your mind has been corrupted is clear, but tell us, if leprosy cannot be contracted by elves, how has it infected you?  

Dalau: Do you like it? I find the effect fascinating. My features sprouting new growths or wasting away altogether. The patterns: random, exquisitely entropic. Did you know that I no longer feel pain? Nothing can hurt me - not steel or poison or fire. Just one of the Goddess' beautiful gifts. Her creatures devised a way for the disease to be passed to me, where Nature itself had found none.  

Cudaleg: Why would you allow this?  

Dalau: It's simple. I was jealous.  

Cudaleg: Jealous of what? Of whom?  

Dalau: Of the beauty of others. My colleagues and companions were always fairer than I. More grace. ful, attractive and lovely. I even envied some of the more nubile humans, their fine skin and long hair.  

Cudaleg: All this, because you were not content with your own beauty?  

Dalau: I am not ashamed of my desires.  

Cudaleg: But if it was beauty you craved, why blight yourself with this horrific disease?  

Dalau: Oh my dear friend. The disease is not for me. I was already too ugly - there was no hope for me. No, the disease is for you. I offer it gladly, that every elf in this fortress may know Kuulima's caress. Once the Fly has touched you, you will lose that which I envied, and I will be at peace. That is her primary command: if I cannot have it, no one can.  

Cudaleg: This is preposterous! You mean to infect us with leprosy?  

Dalau: The strain I carry is contagious to all of elvenkind. It will spread quickly. Soon all of you will become truly hideous.  

Cudaleg: The monstrous pleasure you take in your own madness is fooling no one, Doctor. You were arrested at the first sign of disease. You have been quarantined behind thick glass, and when this trial is concluded, you will be executed and your body burned to ash.  

Dalau: And neither does your arrogant air hide your fear, false Judge. I welcome my own fate, for I am grotesque. Simply know this. Leprosy is incubated in the body for many years before symptoms begin to show. I have been doing Kuulima's bidding much longer than you realise. Hiding among you, working and dining with you, sharing your food, your water. Frequently touching you. Most of you are already long infected - I see in your face you know I speak the truth, oh yes. It will not be long now before you see the signs. And when they come, be sure to thank our Lady of Flies!

# KUULIMA'S DECEIVER  

he Circle of Kuulima was a panoply of icono= graphy and imagery. I witnessed representations of relics from Vetian religions of our own times, alongside artefacts of pantheons long dead and buried. Banners and statues of all nations adorned architecture spanning dozens of cultures. It gave an impression of a museum in Sonnstahl, containing items from myriad civilisations, or else a wealthy merchant's home, bedecked more for spectacle than any sense of elegance.  

The way ahead crossed a gilded bridge, surrounded by plinths displaying helms  of   all shapes, each sundered by a blow which would have laid the wearer low, be they elf, man, dwarf, orc or any other creature. Beneath this glittering span a river flowed, the liquid within bright green, verdant and sickly. Yet no true water ever bubbled and hissed as that brook dic

No great daemons these. Their image constantly   
altered, reflecting a lack of will. They chattered   
and bared teeth in our direction, an animosity   
clear to behold. But their attention was on my   
guide - at no point did they adopt his armoured   
visage, and their eyes never left him as they   
snarled. A sneer curled his lips as he stared down   
those creatures blocking his path, as though he would simply stomp them into the ground should they fail to part. In a wave from the back of the crowd, the fluctuating figures suddenly fixed, tiny soldiers  of  humanoid form, with skin of shimmering silver. Then, like fish before a predator they scattered in all directions, disappearing from view. In their place stood a being of dis  
concerting appearance. A gilded   
stplate of Destrian design was  

As our feet reached the start of the arch we were confronted by a horde of chittering daemons, clambering out from under the bridge and arraying across its span, blocking our path and snarling. Each moment their form shimmered and changed, as they adopted aspects of my appearance: the robes I had donned that morning, the bronze pomander gifted to me by the Sage Werdin, the sturdy boots I purchased on the advice of a cavalry officer years past.  

coupled with a gleaming Qassari shield, resplendent with heraldry of Kuulima. A helm like that of a highborn elf was topped with a plume of white hair draping down to an engraved gorget.  

The daemon itself appeared almost human, yet no human ever possessed such proportions, save in a sculptor's nightmares. Its head appeared overly large, features exaggerated, with eyes that burned like torches and a sharp-toothed smile extending far wider than should have been possible.  

![](images/160858bb6745336f8a464a07af4a45b19a0e3700919e62f8b8683aec57d4425a.jpg)  

Its skin was a bright argent, rippling with strange muscles and seeming to meld into its armour. Even the weapon it bore, a Sonnstahler greatsword of almost absurd scale, seemed an extension of itself. All these incongruous elements should have looked ridiculous, the strangest of chimeric creatures, but I was left with the sense of an imperious presence.  

None of the hesitance of the lesser entities was visible here; this daemon was assured and unflinching. It stood upon the bridge with complete self-possession, sword held indifferently propped on the ground. Only the intensity of those eyes gave the lie to its idle stance. I felt utterly immaterial to this impasse, as my companion bristled under that scrutiny. Moments dragged out, the air seemed to crackle with intensity, and both parties subtly flexed limbs and hefted arms.  

The moment was broken as, almost simultaneously, each gave the smallest of nods, and spoke over one another.  

# "Betrayer" "Deceiver"  

As though that was all that needed to be said, the Deceiver stepped from the bridge, and stood at ease, the way ahead clear Passing close at hand, I took in more detail, observing the panoply of adornments covering that bizarre form. Grasping hands crossed with sigils and crests - with the dominant motif of a daemonic fly. In silence we crossed, and travelled-the Circle for some time before I dared disturb the hush.  

"You serve the same master as the denizens of this plane, unless I miss my mark. Yet there was no love lost between the guardians of the bridge and yourself. Are daemons not the allies of Warriors?"  

Moments passed in contemplation before the answer was given, during which time we passed a series of buildings. Each aspect of every structure seemed to reflect a different style of architecture, a cacophony of conflict which seemed ready to crumble any moment.  

"You ask questions without simple answers, though it is right you should comprehend. You know of the value placed upon personal freedom by those who choose the Dark Gods. It is well known and why the Warriors will always find fertile ground among the oppressed and exploited. Among daemons, it seems autonomyis an accomplishment of the powerful, or perhaps a reward for the favoured.  

"On the other hand, Warriors expect and earn that freedom from the very moment they swear, from their first steps on the Paths, while some daemons will never know its sweet taste. Meanwhile, daemons already possess that for which Warriors strive: immortality and a place close to the gods. You might imagine those contrasts can rankle."  

The Betrayer considered for a long moment be. fore continuing:  

![](images/cf8c44bb05e7361e2bd89a9081da620b3ad01fa0ee0b3643c575a493ca5c4291.jpg)  

"Yet I serve the same master as that Deceiver. There is a commonality to our natures, and we may find ourselves parties to the same causes in the Mortal Realm. I even respect its prowess. I know that if we were to battle, it would find the best of my nature and turn it against me. The better I am, the better it becomes. Such a being is worthy of recognition."  

We continued in a contemplative silence, finally coming to behold one of the strangest sights I would witness in my time here. It took long moments to process what I saw: oddly bifurcated forms gradually resolving into the shapes of people, split down the middle as though sundered by some wicked axe.  

These were no corpses left for carrion - eyes blinked at me from each half of the bodies, and lips moved, seeming to form my name. I stepped closer, all the while trying to ignore the viscera of that terrible wound. A croaking whisper greeted my ear, bubbling through welling blood.  

"Beware... Those who would sow division in life.. here find their sins visited upon them... Would that I had never...thought to breed discord between brothers... Forsake me now...but forget not...we live the Hell we make.."  

Shuddering, I left the unfortunate soul behind me, but renewed my scrutiny of the Betrayer wondering what had brought him to swear his soul to Kuulima. By our journey's conclusion, I would know more of my enigmatic guide.

# MAGEBLIGHTGREMLINS  

When I arwed back at the court of Zalos, Pnnce Damien was in mid-tirade. The son of the Patrician and younger brother of Nikos, the murder victim, Danien is ahotblooded nobleman, known forhis tenper Hisfather listened from his wooden throne with a resignation that was clearly habitual, while the son paced back and forth.  

"Enough of this inaction! he rared."We have ben attacked by another kingdom! They have stnck us in our vey home! We must respond with full strength of ams. father let me lad our anmy to Civissina. We wil cnsh the Doge and the rbellion he has pemitted to fester within his walls, and we wileact vengeance on whichevr bastard mongrel thought they coud strike at the House of Zalos!"  

The Patrician considered him for a few moments. Without taking his eyes off his son, he responded  

"And what do the Keepers of the Veil have to say about the charges leveled at aur long-time all?"  

![](images/d636a71557347cab0dcd3f7bef8837018339eba7b45c3ec0c7b94706c51ae098.jpg)  

Itwasseveral momentsbeforeI realised hewas addressingme.   
I stepped forward, and lowered my hood.  

"( can find no connection between the crime committed here and the rebels of Ciuvissina. I do not believe they are your eneny.  

There was a series of gasps around the rom. Al eyes swuelld back to Prnce Danien.  

"What?! he belowed, face cnmson with fury."This is what you get from a cnumbling order that long ago lost any real power to serve or prtect us. We have it on good authonty that villins from the Order of the Equlateral infltrated the palace. We all know they came from Civissina. And now this so-called agent of the Vel denies a connection!?"  

"I was not pemitted a chane to question theseillans myself,ht fthey do belong to the Oer they we not sent by Civrissina.  

"You dare-"  

"Quiet! rang at the vice of the Patician, who seeed to have rcoveed a litle from his al-onsuming gnf.   
"The curt will adjoum. Clearly we mst seek further infommation before we junp to any rash acts of war.

He was interpted by series of loud popping souds, lke uandanee firrakers.  

Get down! I yelld, diving at the Prince and knocking him to the ground. His rage turned to teror when he saW what had just missed his head. A dozen tiny, rotund gremlins, no more than a foot or two in height, zoomed out of thin air ncocheting around the room and accumulating together in the centre of the floor Cackling inpishly they swaned towands the throne, brandishing sharp claws and teeth. At first I thought they aimed for the Patin, t inft they we heded to tefuat hisside the asistant, Cassia arki,whohe as she tied to bat them away with her papers.  

I dew ny ting dager and chared the helish cnttrs,flinching at their uts and slis asI hacked them apart, one by one, puling them off my hair and ams whee they gieed and howled. Soon I was asisted in the fight by Damien, who fung himself between Sarki and the daemons and awkwarly slashed at them with a sWord that was much too long and heay for the task. We would have been in considerable danger were it not for the fat that the creatures attentions wee not foused on the Prine or myself.  

"Minions of Kulima,” I said, when they wee allslain at last."They appear suddenly across the Vel, neeing very litte magic to materalise, seeking to catch their prey unawares.  

Those present cast wide-eyed looks at each other.  

"Something must have drawn them, I said.

Iesh had his nose in a mug when the traveller walked in. The man eased into a nearby seat, flicking water droplets across the bench as he waved to the barkeep.  

"Working up to a storm," muttered the stranger to Jesh. He passed the keep a gold coin, marked by an ornate gate on one side. Marv, the barman, eyed it closely before returning a beer.  

Jesh turned to face the man. There was a tiredness in his eyes, like a weathering of the mind, despite his jovial air. He sipped his beer, before cringing.  

"Come on Marv, I paid my tab yesterday!" a regular was complaining.  

"If you don't got the coin, you don't get no beer," growled Marv, darkly.  

Jesh turned back to the newcomer with an apologetic shrug, and noticed the ring on the latter's finger. A simple wooden band with a polished iron head, probably worthless but clearly ancient. A signet ring Was a strange sight in a place like this. Important folks usually ate elsewhere.  

![](images/73445722d65472587568bea45078bc2a712cf755d66a39be290ebc0192bf4253.jpg)  

"You serving me water, keep?"  

They sat for afew moments, a silence hanging between them.  

The barman scowled, taking the mug and refilling it from a fresh casket. The man suckled the new pint, unfazed by the attempted con.  

"Good day, friend?" Jesh asked. It wasn't often that the bar got visitors, and rarer still that Jesh was in a mood to talk.  

The man hummed in agreement. "Aye, and better now. Feel like a weight's off my shoulders."  

Jesh turned at the shouting to his left.  

"I used to live near the northern coast," the traveller started, sensing the need for an explanation. “I had the good fortune to inherit a wealthy estate."  

Jesh raised his eyebrows. Now he was eyeing the man's stained cloak and ragged gear. The stranger shifted in his seat.  

"I don't fully understand how I got here either. I keep turning it over - and it comes back to the trader Bigwig that used to do business with my father, very rich man, once upon a time.  

About a year back he turns up at our manor looking just like I do now. In rags."  

Without turning his head away, Jesh raised his hand for an ale, sensing his was empty. \*The keep held out his hand. Only then did Jesh turn - Marv never made him pay before the end of the night. But he was too invested in the newcomer's story to argue. He paid, and bid the man continue.  

"The merchant gave me a coin - just one - in exchange for a night's stay. A simple request. But that coin.. It sounds foolish, but somehow it called to me. I hardly noticed as the trader left the next morning, though now I think back, he seemed so happy and free, glad to be gone."  

The man sighed deeply at this point, and a tremor entered his voice.  

"From that point on, I became... Someone else." Jesh saw the stranger's knuckles turn white."The fear gripped me - the fear of losing anything. The estates were mine, and nothing was going to take them from me. I grew ruthless, and my business prospered. I would sit long nights counting great stacks of gold. And the people starved because I would let nothing leave my coffers. But I did not care."  

The man took a slow, sickly swig of ale, his eyes shut grimly.  

'I pushed up prices, cheated my partners. It was only right they should pay a premium, I thought.\*1 needed the gold more than they did. It wasn't long before there was no one left to trade with. The final straw came when.." His voice trembled. "When I disinherited my son. The mere thought of anyone taking what was rightfully mine, even after my death, it made me sick. I lost everything, as quickly as I had gained it. They rose up against me, but in my madness...I struck down my son."  

The man hid his eyes, and Jesh knew better than to prod any further Eventually, the traveller raised his head and sculled the last of his beer, standing as he did so. He straightened his coat, moving to leave.  

"What happened to the coin?" Jesh asked. The man stood, framed in the doorway against the hissing rain.  

"1 just paid for that drink with it" he confessed. "I'm flat broke."  

They both looked at the barman in the shadows among the barrels, face like stone, eying his customers suspiciously, while his fingers worked counting coin faster than l'd ever seen. The stranger gave one last sigh of relief, and shut the door behind him.

# HOARDERS  

Acrober 4th  

I was tacked for days by minins of Sugulag blated, pstulent raturs that sltheed and squimed withinerble tenacity. There wee no more giant Misers, ht the smaller horders were no les rpellant and deadly. My pistols wer all but useles against them, an while I was able to aid or distract the maonty more wgled trugh the Veil. Someone had set the fores of Gred against me, and they wee coming to collet my saud.  

If they wanted me gone, it was because I had been on the nght path, back inZalos. I knew that I had no option bt to contine my ivestigation until I had fud the tne kier inded, I thirsted for reengeWith the hoaders er at my back, I went north, to Civissina, whee I was certain the Zalosi anmy would be encamped When I eached the city I could see my assumptions were correct. The standards of Zalos surrounded the city wals. A great siege was already underway and the tw sides had begun afere exchange of frams. e attacking fores were aleady samin up the wals on ladders, and seemed to hve the aduntage.  

![](images/00c6a21b8f692949b0d20c1e26be5ba9bbcd78ed0d2bb8e4aeabb42b4cb0d708.jpg)  

looked closer at the walls. To my surprise, the Doges standards had been removed from the gate, rplaced by cnudely daubed trangles. Realising that the revolution had already seized the city I saw a Way to bay myself some time. I hid my black cloak and stole a tunic from a fallen Zalosi man-at-anms. I mingled among the ranks waiting to join the assault, and soon enough, I heard the screaming I had expected from the rear of our position. The hoarders had come for me, and now they were attacking the soldiers in the way.  

The sudden appearance of daemons threw the Zalosi army into confusion. As the tide of battle turned, I pushed forward towards the walls while my reteating “comrades steamed back past me. nfortunately, my luck was nnning at. The men wee rapidy fleeing from the daemons, and a kind of path fommed in the ranks, alng which I coud see the hoarders coning, their flesh sheng ith the antipationof my deis. I was pinned aganst the gatesthesee, wch we lcked ad bared.  

Just then, Iflt a powerful force above. I loked up, and thee on the wall I saw the elderly sorceress I had met in te catacombs. She loked into my eyes. I did not knowif she was stil possed, bt she was perfoming dark magics with amazing confidence and skil.

The gates opened with the sand of heay bolts being drawn back, and I was seized by the defenders and puled through. The last thing I saw before they closed again was a momentary glinpse of a dark figure. It stood at the back of the Zalosi anmy anms raised to the heavens. At his sign, the daermons stopped again, seeminy paralysed, and then their entire bodies cozed and vanished into the soil below, like sails in a dying wind.

ie distant village to take a census. It was the first attempt at organising the tribute system into an accountable form of taxation, back in the early days of the new kingdom. The villagers were resistant to being counted, and their witch doctor encouraged them to mock and jeer at us. He was clearly a spiteful fellow, used to being the head man and displeased by his tribe's recent al  
legiance to the King.  

The King's representatives were led by a distinguished older woman. She was an imbongi, which is a type of bard or preacher, a keeper of historical records and  oral storytelling. I had heard her recite the sacred list of ancestors at official rituals. She told her companions, including myself, to wait outside the village, until the locals were ready to see us. I was amazed at her calm and confidence, and I asked how she kept herself so peaceful. Didn't she want to rage at her treatment by the witch doctor and the villagers? Didn't she want to see them punished? In response, she told me the following tale:

Long ago, there lived a lion who was never happy with the way things were. He used to complain about everything in his life, and he could always find someone to blame. One day, he was walking through the savannah when he met a cockerel with red eyes and a red crest.  

"You seem sad" said the cockerel. "What seems to be the problem?"  

"Nothing is as it should be," said the lion."I love to eat fruit from the trees, but the monkey who fetches it for me has not been bringing me enough to sate my  

hunger I want to have more children, but the golden phoenix has not granted me birth of any offspring for many months, and I have only one cub. I want to have friends to hunt and play with, but just a handful of hyenas come to augh with me. I should have nore than this."  

"You are right, great lion" said the cockerel with the red eyes."You deserve more. I can grant you the power of the red goddess, and she will give you what you want. Or, if she does not, then she will give you the power to punish those who are keeping good things from you. Does this sound pleasing to you?"  

"Yes. Tell me what to do," said the lion.  

"You must kill me and cut out my heart. Take it to the mountain top and place it on your tongue. For seven days you must sit and focus on your anger Then the red goddess will show you what to do."  

The lion did as he was told. After seven days on the mountaintop, he ate the red-eyed cockerel's heart, and he knew what he must do. He came down into the savannah and he found the monkey.  

"You have wronged me, monkey" said the lion. "You did not bring me all the fruit from the tree that I desired."  

So saying, he killed the monkey and ate it. From that day forwards, he received no fruit at all, and was forced to eat only animal meat.

Then he found the golden phoenix that lives in the jungle.  

"Golden phoenix, you have done me great injustice. You did not make me fertile, and I have birthed only one cub."  

So saying, he killed the golden phoenix and ate it, and he was never fertile again. Afterwards, his cub soon died and he had no more children.. From that day forwards, he was forced to mate with the lioness to bear his cubs.  

Finally, he met the hyenas at the watering hole.  

'Hyena pack, you have treated me with great disrespect by refusing to be my friends. So few of you have come to laugh and hunt with me," said the lion.  

So saying, he killed many hyenas and ate them. From that day forwards, the remaining hyenas became the sworn enemy of the lion, and the lion was forced to hunt alone.  

The red goddess came to the lion and said, “You have done well, for you let your anger guide you.  

"I have less now than I had before," said the lion.  

"But those who treated you badly have suffered," said the red goddess. "And that is all that matters."  

And she gave him a garland of red hair for a mane, as a symbol of her favour

# VANADRA'S SCOURGE  

It was during the third month plying my trade lacross the Sultanate of Qassar, when my erstwhile companion and translator Raashid and I were quenching our thirst at an inn in the town of Halban. Among the patrons of this small establishment were several soldiers; we'd noticed patrols along the road and knew the army was camped nearby. Everyone seemed on edge.  

"Dark powers are abroad," Raashid explained.  

"Where? In Vetia?"  

"I mean, they roam the lands. The people say that a creature has been seen across the desert sands. Nomad camps found deserted or burned. A dark name is whispered"  

"What name?"  

Raashid glanced around the room and leaned closer.  

"Shayteen," he whispered. "A daemon of rage."  

"Ah. Like a djinn?" I said, referring to the supernal beings known to dwell wherever the Alihat trinity was worshipped. Their magic had even been harnessed by the Qassari army.  

"Similar, but much more fearful" said Raashid. "The djinn are born of the desert's fire. The shayteen is born of the smoke. The djinn serve the Three Goddesses, glory be upon them. The shayteen serves only one goddess. The Adversary"  

My eyes widened, but something in his tone prevented me from asking further questions.  

Days later, after trying once more to find an audience in the souks of Halban's labyrinthine medina, I was approached by a young woman with an anxious expression.  

"She wants you to follow her She is afraid" Raashid translated. I nodded. This smelled like a good story.  

She took us through the maze of narrow alleys to a warehouse. Behind heaps of jumbled exotic merchandise, there was a trapdoor in the dirt, hidden beneath a rug. The woman would go no further, but pointed fearfully at the symbol. A series of crude lines depicting a face full of anger.  

A staircase led to a small, windowless basement. I carried a lamp, the flame dancing across red, soot-stained walls. There was a heavy smell of sulphur and charcoal. Dark red cloaks were folded on a bench, opposite a table arranged as an altar. The object of worship was all too clear.  

"A cult of Vanadra," I whispered. "Why was this brought to me?"  

Raashid looked truly terrified, but he kept his composure.  

"You're a foreigner. If she reports it, she could be suspected or even arrested"  

"So I should inform the army?"  

![](images/31f91d38bc75aad3ae2951cb2f0911e9a91e4090c57a80f457a2d10273a2c63d.jpg)  

"Not the army. They would only persecute the townsfolk, guilty or not. We should bring this to the temple. The imams will know what to do"  

The mysterious woman had already left as we emerged. We hurried to the grand temple, an imposing shape against the sunset. Raashid bade me remove my shoes before entering. The space inside was amazingly serene and peaceful. I admired the intricate beauty of the decoration while Raashid spoke in an urgent tone to a cleric.  

We were ushered into an office with three desks.   
Behind each sat a bearded man in white robes.   
The central imam smiled warmly.  

"Please, what have you come to tell me, Vetian? You may speak your own language. I have dealt with enough crusaders to understand you"  

I told them briefly what we had found, though I admit I may have added more literary flare than was required. The expressions of the three priests hardened.  

"This is very serious news," said the talkative one. "We will investigate at once. We are very grateful for the report - please be assured that this evil will be stamped out immediately"  

He smiled, eerily, and somehow his words were not as comforting as they were intended. Raashid and I left, returning towards the inn for the night. We never made it. As we turned into an empty street there was the smell of smoke. Deep chanting could be heard from unseen sources.  

"Shayteen.." I heard Raashid breathe, his face white. And then he was sprinting away down an alley. Before I could follow, something struck me in the back.  

When I woke up, my body seemed to be on fire. Unsteadily, I realised this was because I was lying on the burning sand of the desert, under a high sun. There was still smoke in my nostrils, and the overwhelming smell of brimstone.  

"Ah. I am pleased you have woken. You forced us to hasten our plans - it is only fitting you see this yourself."  

I recognised the voice before my bleary eyes could blink away the sand. It was the well-spoken imam. He and his two colleagues now wore crimson robes, vivid against the harsh yellow sea that stretched all around us. In the far distance I thought I could see the walls of Halban. But more immediately concerning was the terror in the eyes of the young woman who was tied to the makeshift altar. I recognised her as the one who had shown us the cultists' meeting place. If only we had known that the very priests of the town, the spiritual leaders themselves, had been corrupted.  

As I looked into her desperate eyes, the leading imam stabbed her in the heart with a crescentshaped dagger. The three of them were chanting something terrible in their native tongue, their voices rising in intensity and anger. I almost passed out again as my stomach lurched from the sudden accretion of magic in the vicinity. Sickened and horrified, I watched as the woman's body, as well as jars of substances arranged around the altar, were dissolved by a vigorous magical maelstrom. Smoke and sand whirled into a miniature hurricane, within which something vast and red began to glow. I glimpsed horns, cloven hooves and huge black wings. I wanted to run, but my eyes were fixed, my face burning with the ferocity of the desert's wrath incarnate.  

Before I could see the full form of the brute, I felt rough hands drag me onto another surface. I realised I was to be the next sacrifice. Behind me I heard snorting and stamping of something bestial and impatient. There was the sense of vast power barely contained. A hound desperate to be loosed on the hunt.  

"Our glorious Scourge needs a weapon. Take comfort knowing your death summoned the liv. ing scimitars used to cleave this Realm in twain."  

I saw the knife raised above me, the sun's blinding reflection turning the world white. Then I heard a grunt. Blinking, I saw the length of an arrow protruding from the imam's chest. Out across the desert, a battalion of horse archers was advancing with the banners of the Sultan.  

The other priests were already running. I stared,   
awestruck, as something huge and scarlet blot  
ted out the sun, rising through the air on great   
wing beats. It landed in the thick of the fray.   
Squinting, I saw the Qassari soldiers assault the   
beast, but the more blows they landed the more   
viciously they were devastated, as it issued an in  
credible roar that split my ears even at the great distance between us. Horses and humans flew like broken dolls from its tremendous fists. I do not know how the fight concluded - my mind filled with the sound of approaching hooves and I looked up as a rider hefted me onto his mount.  

"Raashid," I said, before losing consciousness. "You came back for me. You saved me from the shayteen"

# BRAZEN BEASTS  

Acrober6th  

Father Miceli is gone. It has taken all I have just to wnte those words again. Euy day the pain of missng him grows sharper and more debilitatin, bt withit grows ny detemination to find the one who tok him.  

I ecall a sermon he gave, when I was still new in his senvice. It was the story of how he lost his partner and closest friend on a mission in Taphria. A local sorcerr unleashed a stampede of brazen beasts - unstoppable, lumbering machines fuelld by Helfir. Micelisaid that it was only ofter they slew his comrade that he found the stength to defeat the sorcerer in revenge. His lesn Was that the sins on which the Danr Gods prey even Wrath, can be weapons in the hands of the righteous.  

That semon has long played on my mind. I toohave known the painof loss at the hands of Vanadra, and have flt her hot fury in my veins. I fee it now when I think of Miceli, and of my mother whose final words stillning in my ears, teng me toe b. I st not fal he n.  

I am a guest of the Equilateral Revltion, as it now cals itself, enamped in the fommer palace of the Doge. Thy rsced me from the hoarders, bt I do not know if I should lend them my own support. I must admit, this is a city that has nt selonsine thetef eii, yets toe aging teuhel admirably. Casualties wee minimal during the uprising, and an erordinary umber of the injured have made fll Rcoveries. Te citizens hae fommed an efcient and unified interm government that is fairly distibting resources and coordlinating the defence against Zalos - for the siege continues.  

And everywhee ther are daemons. Many ar tne manifestations, summoned by the nitual exeution of crininals and sabteurs, inclding a mighty warbeast of Vanadra lurd by the sacrfice of the Doge himself Perhaps it is the sae maner of devil encouteed allthose years agoby MicliEil-loking smoke ses fromits cmson plates of anmour,lke steam from the hide of a prehistonc behenoth, its hooves stanping with poorly contained Wrath.  

There is nt enough magic to sustain allthese creatures at once, so they flng themseles at the eneny trops until they are slain. Others have token bodily possesson of the townsfol, who welcome them for their talents and knowledge.  

One of the possessed is the woman in white, the sorcerer who saved me from the daemons of Gred and who I lst encounteed in the catacombs.She came to my chambers this evening, and the daenon f Cibarsh within her spoke tome.  

"You see now how litle you really know, do you not?" she said.   
"I am not ashamed to thank you for aiding me, I replied.   
"I am pleased to hear it. Perhaps we will see that gratitude turn to action.  

' am not a soldier of Civissina, and I am not in your debt. We locked eyes for several moments. "But it is tnue that we hae a common eneny.  

"(ndeed,” she smiled. "How curious that my spies tell me the Patrician believes we killed his son, and that you were the very agent sent to find the killer  

"I told him you are not the cupnts. He would not listen to 》   
reason.  

"I see. Do you think he would listen to evidence?  

"What do you mean?  

The woman sighed, and her liquid gold eyes seemed tired. "We are besieged. We cannot continue to bring aid from the (mmortal Realm forever. Our supplies will not last the month. The lives of all the citizens here are at stake. Our only hope is that Zalos calls off its attack.  

"You want me to convince the Patrician 1/   
you are not his eneny. "I want you to finish your mission, Keeper.   
And I believe you want it too.  

# Brazen Beasts  

The slaves of Vanadra, the Adversary, are always furious. The mortal world enrages them,They materialise in the shape f giant, stampeding engines of war, not dissimilar to earthly karkadan, ut driven by dark energies and hellish machinery. These avatars of bloodshed are so single-minded in their pursuit of murder that it is hard to tell whether they are beast or machine, although of course to a daemon there is litle difference. They encourage smaller imps ofWrath to accompany them into the fray, only enhancing the devastation of their charges. But make no mistake - it is the beast that is master. Whether it is "in control' is another matter.  

![](images/c50e8ba3a2eb13150cfb906606ba0b8425d36199d9c7446cffa9afa6f180cb29.jpg)  

t was my third week on the steppe and I was I increasingly doubting my ability to keep evading the ogres, orcs and beast herds that roamed this region. But the Tsuandanese map held true, and finally I found the strange rock formations that it showed. There, in a crevice between two almighty boulders, I spied a spiral of smoke.  

I approached the little hidden cottage nervously, clutching the talisman my brothers had given me when I embarked on this mission. Everything hinged on this. The first step was to not get killed.  

"You're perfectly safe," came a mys terious voice from inside the house. "You'll be wanting tea."  

The door was opened by a woman, about forty years old, with a strange pink patterning across her skin. Her eyes were a bright shade of the same colour, and she wore grey robes.  

"You're the sorcerer, aren't you," I said, forgetting my manners. "Did you foresee my coming?"  

![](images/5bed7f939a968e0e02045a7ba46c0885b3cdd1b32c62229575469d5d09b7fc08.jpg)  

"I heard your footsteps on the path, if that's what you mean."  

A little dazed, I found I was already inside the one-room abode and there was a cup of something spiced and warm in my hands.  

"So what is it? You want to serve the Dark Gods? Be my apprentice? Kill me and take my recipes?"  

"I want to know about daemons," I stuttered."Is it true you lived among them, in the Wasteland?"  

"Ye-es" she said, carefully. "In my younger days.   
Taught me my love of corrupting order and undermining nations, that sort of thing. Haven't been back though. It's not a nice place, if you're thinking of going. Look what it did to my complexion."  

"We - my brothers and I - we know how to summon a daemon. But we want to know how to control it. We've heard stories.."  

"Control it?Whatever for?"  

"Um. The infinite knowledge of...you know, the Immortal Realm. Wealth and power beyond imagining? We have this grimoire, you see.."  

"Let me guess, you all wear hoods and meet in poorly lit cellars."  

"Sometimes, I suppose-"  

"It never ends well, I'll tell you that for free," she said, staring into her mug. "You summon a Pride daemon, you make a deal for power first thing it's going to do is, it's going to slowly drain your sanity and start you on a self-destructive spiral.  

Summon a Greed daemon, you'll be drowning in gold - literally. Envy daemon will make you stronger than your neighbour, but only cos you've both lost everything to your other neighbour Classic daemon school of bargaining"  

"Surely there must be a way. If we're careful.' "1 know what I'd do. I'd summon a Sloth daemon. Tell me, how do you feel right now?"  

"Feel? Excited, I suppose, since I finally found you-"  

"No, I mean your body. What is it telling you?"  

"I'm a little peckish. And glad to be off my feet"  

"There you go - you're tired. We all are. Every day, it's just one weary slog after another - am I right? Now, your basic Sloth daemon is going to grant you knowledge and then sap your desire to use it for anything. But to me that's a pretty positive outcome, considering what happens to most people who haggle with daemons. I always thought the Nukuja lot were the happiest cultists out there, when it comes to pure contentment. They know what they want, and what they want is nothing. The power of not caring - now that's a power really worth having. That's a power with style. I swear, all the other gods secretly admire Nukuja. She's got a good gig, just sitting back and watching everyone else fret. My kind of gal. And you know the best bit?"  

"What," I said, in horrified fascination.  

"She's never tired. She always sleeps well. And that's a trick worth learning. Of course, the Sloth cults don't spread quick. But if you find one, talk to some of people who worship there - if you can get them to talk. Or open their eyes.  

You'll see what I mean. Those are some real, hardcore believers. There's no question they'll outlast all the rest of us. And if you do end up summoning a Sloth daemon, you'll see their powers are no joke either. If they don't move a lot, ask yourself why. It's because they don't need to. They'll liquify your flesh with a blink. Good listeners, too, if you have something to get off your chest. Sure I can't get you to pledge your immortal soul before you leave?"

Once again, I found myself nding trough the nigt towands Zalos. When I arived in the town squar, a crowd had already fonmed, though the sun had not yet nsen. I soon lerned they were waiting to witness the trial of the palace seruants who had allegedly summoned the Mav that kiled Pnnce Nikos.

Doning the peasant garb of the locals, I was able to enter the jalhouse where the condemned wee being held.

# HOPEHARVESTER  

...That same year, the tribe of Iocundi in the province of Upper Varalia grew enraged at the tribute forced on them by Galenus, a first-rank centurion. Having first demanded hides of the Iocundi's cattle, Galenus had increased the tithe to include lands and finally slaves, at which decree the chiefs rose up and the garrison of three hundred Avrasi was cut to pieces.  

Galenus, having taken refuge in flight, sent word that he was besieged in the forest by the massed forces of the Iocundi, and that he believed they were turning to Dark Powers to take their vengeance. Lucius Alypius, propraetor of Varalia Inferior, dispatched the legionary veterans, as well as picked auxiliary infantry and cavalry. Having found a ford in the river, the legionaries came upon the Iocundi in the rear, quickly dispersing them through the trees.  

But the very next day, Galenus found the Iocundi regrouped upstream. Their attitude had changed significantly, and their army, though numerous, seemed strangely still and watchful. It was later reported by survivors that the barbarians had been inspired by the stories of Cacophrax in Gessia Minor, and had turned to the Goddess of Sloth for aid. For there among them came the pilentum gigans, a mighty construct devoted to malaise and despair. The legionaries were struck down by a living fog of hopelessness, and those that stood and fought were crushed beneath unstoppable wheels.  

Galenus was forced back across the river, and the lands beyond were abandoned for many years. The Iocundi name, and that of their goddess, thus became famous in Varalia, and the consuls kept the losses a secret at home, not wishing to alarm the people in Avras.

Time slowed and stretched as I entered the Circle of Nukuja, as though the air itself congealed. Lethargy settled upon me, like a chill in my bones, until I slumped under the weight of apathy. Even the Betrayer, so certain in his actions, appeared to hesitate and falter beneath that terrible burden.  

Before us, the source of our listlessness would soon become apparent, as forms emerged from the gloom of that place. Trees of myriad shapes dotted the landscape, stunted things, their trunks and branches gnarled, knots and hollows giving the impression of faces drawn in anguish [.]  

Turning, I was confronted by a [tree] which was larger and more menacing than anything else in the thicket. It loomed over the Betrayer and I both, unmoving, yet it had not been there moments before, I was certain. I would later come to know the Hope Harvester in the shapes it takes in our world. Always lumbering beings, yet to be near them is to risk life and limb, for it takes energy from its victims, then their lives.  

Spurred into action, I dragged the Betrayer away from his reverie, and away from that mournful forest. As we drew near to leaving this place of indolence, we walked alongside a plain of burning sand, where desperate souls were driven to walk in endless circles, with no respite from the searing pain save to move continuously.

# CLASSIFICATIONS OF THELEGIONS  

Throughout the long history of the secret art of summoning demons, many of the greatest mages and researchers have established symbolic correspondences and classifications of daemons to enforce their evocation techniques. For though each daemon has its own unique harmonies and resonance, an understanding of their various similarities and potential groupings could grant better results in ritual.  

According to the Sagarikan master of the dark arts, Dasa Guptha, who wrote the famous On the Conjurer's  Secrets  ("Jaadoogar Ke Rahasy"), daemons can firstly be divided in two kinds: those with their nature 0 inextricably tied to a Dark God, and those with their nature being neutral. In addition, he claimed tha a certain portion of the greater legions was able to switch its loyalty from one Dark God to another - usually the less powerful daemons. Whether these daemons are intentionally independent from the gods by exercise of their will, or they are too weak to be worthy of higher attention - or, perhaps, they are loyal to a more secret agenda of the Father - has been debated through the millennia.  

The venerable Guptha's resulting eightfold classification matched each daemon to one or none of the gods, in turn affiliated with its icon, its colour, and with a day of the week on which it was supposedly best to summon (Pride on dies Primus,  

![](images/766804783f376e1f54707640a4b53db20314fb8c0c8aad6f5228d05c591760c3.jpg)  

Greed on dies Atei etc.). This system is both among the most straightforward and dependable of the numerous such systems I have encountered.  

-From 'On the work of the heretics and their daemonic masters, by Mikhail Psellus  

Daemons can be divided according to their rank within the legion. The higher the rank, the crueler the sacrifice required. The  

greatest hordes are commanded by Dukes, which are the most powerful sons of the seven flowers of Chaos. Only the most experienced conjurers   
W can attempt to look for answers from them, for they are dangerous even for an entire conclave of masters. They can   
grant enormous powers and deep  

knowledge, but the price to be paid is often unthinkable.  

Next are the Legates, patrons of the passions of the mortals; it is said they can grant love, hate, authority and whatever kind of emotion if properly mollified by fulfilment of the favours they ask.  

Then come the Centurions, that have infinite power over matter. According to tradition, they can turn lead into gold, water into wine, rock into living flora, and they can even teach such powers to the conjurer if sufficiently pleased with the pain and fear of a proper victim.  

Lastly come the Soldiers, the infinite multitude of common daemons with countless shapes and unspeakable voices. Do not underestimate their power, for even a lesser daemon is far stronger than the will of an unpracticed magician. While they do not generally grant specific magical powers, nonetheless they are the key to access the superior spheres of the Legions.  

-From 'The Book of the Infinite Legions, by Georges Sybellicus  

The seven flowers of Chaos correspond to seven underground doors that are opened to access the Yurt of Darkness, where their Father speaks. Seven are the true hours of the night, and during each a Door can be reached, and there access to the daemons of that level can be found. From each door a specific kind of demon will enter the world.  

-Zengmya, of the ogre Sky Mountain tribes, as recorded by a prisoner  

Each daemon enters our realm by joining with one of the twelve primal elements: Air, Water, Fire, Earth, Light, Darkness, Wood, Iron, Gold, Bone, Ichor and Crystal. Not only its shape but its spirit and nature is intrinsically linked with this guiding element. Interwoven and adjacent to this taxonomy can be observed a system of thirteen attributes and abilities, within which every daemon body can be ordered: Humanoid, Bestial, Chimeric, Reptilian, Non-Skeletal (also called "Liquid"), Projective, Aquatic, Shapeshifting, Winged, Intangible, Super-limbed (also tentacled), Magically Proficient and Titanic. Within this twelve by thirteen matrix, a precise measure of every otherworldly form may be approximated.  

-From 'The Art of Madness and Enlightenment, by Sin Tsu Fu, (Tsuandanese outcast)  

These wild spirits are called looking in specific directions, them being North, West, South, East, Upward, Downward and Inward. While the first four kinds of spirits are easier to call and control, those coming from the higher, lower and inner spheres of existence are also the most feared, and able to either kill or make mad the summoner witch himself. They can appear with the strangest shapes, reading into the mind and seeing the most hidden fears and hopes of those calling for them.  

-Tsula nu Ala, Taphrian magician, as recorded by Equitan explorer Pierre Lestoneaux

# DAEMONIC MAGIC  

W ith my sincere thanks to the faculty, I seek to offer insight into a controversial and complex subject, and one that is rarely discussed in Vetia. Daemonology. [pause for noise to settle down] My question for today is simple: which paths of magic are practiced among the Legions, and why?  

Some might ask: why are daemons, born of raw and primal magic, limited in their use of Immortal power in our own Realm? But think - we as beings of matter can hardly claim to be masters of allfields within this world. No more can daemons operate freely in the natural sphere.  

![](images/de3c096990d1fbe121df907212f975a2dde0ab611a170f95f97e5d4541c4d400.jpg)  

# Witchcraft  

# Thaumaturgy  

After the Battle of Hulgrad, survivors reported feelings of judgement and shame. They spoke of strange visions and of creatures that seemed to look deep within their souls. Yet at this very institution, Herr Doctor Machelberg has taught that only wayward women are able to practice witchcraft. A true wizard will tell you this is nonsense. Like all magic, it can be learned by any motivated mage with an affinity and the correct training, but it comes much more easily to a daemon. Where mortal witches might sense the thoughts and feelings of their victims, playing on their superstitions, a daemon focuses these same powers on one of the seven vices on which they so love to prey. I myself have felt the touch of a minion of Greed, and known its Evil Eye in my mind, forcing me to resist its visions of great wealth.  

While a daemon loses the unfettered freedom of the Immortal Realm when it enters our world, it does not entirely lose its umbilical connection to its masters. This has been demonstrated by Professor Anselus, whose experiments with the Keepers of the Veil showed that the energy lost by a true-slain daemon resonates briefly across all daemons of the same kind, wherever they may be. What this shows is that daemons remain at least partially connected across the Veil, and are able to draw directly on the power of the gods they serve. Any thaumaturge will recognise this as the ideal state for practising the "arts of the divine", as they call it. We know that the powers of Thaumaturgy manifest in different forms depending on the deities from which they draw. From my observations, the mages of the Dark Gods produce flames of rainbow hue, as well as particularly violent forms of madness.  

# Evocation  

# Divination  

A skilled evoker must become a nurturer and binder of souls - that small spark of Immortality possessed by every mortal. The magician can play these souls like strings by using their true names - for daemons, this is a most joyful pastime. I have seen them cackle and cavort when they achieve it, though it does not always come easily. They train themselves to focus on one "string" in particular: the one between a person's soul and a Dark God, forged by pact and sealed on death. My experimental research suggests that even where no pact is made, this bond always exists as a potentiality, and its manipulation can produce dreadful results. According to the esteemed Prelate Jungfrau, among daemons these powers appear physically like swirling vortices of deep black tendrils that grasp tirelessly at their victims.  

It is clear how the three Paths so far mentioned lend themselves to daemonic practice. But the unholy supernals are also known to practice a fourth form of spellcraft. I refer to Divination, the magic of foresight, and I believe I have, at last, a theory to explain its common use by daemons. This theory was devised from close reading of texts attributed to those who claim to have visited the Realm Beyond, protected by the favour of a god.  

Such texts are very few in number, and I rely primarily on the so-called triumvirate: Maria of Icante's voyage to the Halls of Sunna, Publius Morgilius Varo's quest to rescue his dead father, and the journey of Nazario Calegari through the seven circles of Hell. All three speak ofthe Immortal Realm as highly changeable and shaped by the will of its denizens - this is well known. But they also provide many references to visions generated by the maelstrom itself, claiming to have glimpsed things in this ocean of magic - historic and current events, as well as presumed images of the future. It is here that we find our answer to the problem of Divination. Daemons have spent eternity in a Realm where that which will come to pass can be read in the very substance ofthe land, for those with the skill to read it, or the patience to acquire such a skill.

# HELLHOUNDS  

Your Excellency,  

Forgive me, for I write to tell you of my failure; the death of your son remains unanswered. Truthfully, the fact that I can write at all is nothing short of a miracle, though not one for which I am sure I am grateful.  

It was mid-afternoon of the second day of the hunt by the time we had cornered our quarry, having pursued her deep into the Almere Forest. It was a hard slog through the undergrowth, but with the help of Kirmakh's hounds we closed the distance. The murdering whore had taken shelter in the remnants of a long-abandoned tower, whose decaying exterior belied the sturdy nature of the refuge. She must have heard the baying hounds, as we found the ancient door barred - still stout despite its age.  

Our attempts to gain entry proved futile, for we had neither axes nor ram to break down the door. Eventually, after much hammering and cursing, the reeve bade his men stand down and surround the structure. Our mark's headlong flight must have left her without food or water All we needed to do was wait, using the dogs to hunt our own dinner. While the others set up camp for the night, secure in the knowledge that there was only one way out of the tower, I enjoyed a thrilling twilight chase through the trees that managed to fetch a large boar. I silently thanked Kirmakh's flawless training of the bloodhounds, proceeding to prepare and roast the game.  

While it was the dogs' howling that rang in my ears as I fell asleep, it was their whimpers that woke me in the dead of night. Rousing ourselves from beds of leaves and dirt, we found the glade suffused with the stench of brimstone. Weapons were drawn, for Kirmakh's prize purebreds, so eager the night before, now cowered and whined at an unseen presence. A pair of shapes moved in the dark, circling us just beyond the firelight. The passage of these creatures made not a sound as they slid through the undergrowth, but low growls rumbled in the darkness, filling me with utter dread.  

At some unspoken signal they leapt towards us - great canine brutes, covered in black fur, with jagged teeth protruding from elongated snouts and eyes that smouldered with unholy fire. In but a moment, they had crossed the distance between us, their snarling jaws closing on two of the reeve's men, seemingly fearless of the blades of their victims. Biting and tearing, they immediately overcame the hapless fieldhands, before turning to the rest of us. Kirmakh's dogs were yapping and jumping, frenzied with fear; one look from their hellish, blood-stained kin caused them to turn and flee into the trees. The rest of us followed suit. I stumbled madly in the direction I believed was homewards, branches whipping my face, my panicked, ragged breathing failing to drown out the gruesome cries of those behind me as they were caught, one by one.  

Three of us made it to the ferry at Naumbruick, and we swam as far as we dared downstream in an effort to lose our scent. Yet when we emerged, exhausted, onto the riverbank, the awful beasts were waiting. One of my companions fainted on the spot from fear; the other was already being ripped apart as I flung myself back into the water, clinging desperately to a log, knowing I was followed the whole way. It wasn't until dawn broke and I came to the open fields of Marchschlag that I dared to hope I had escaped. Even now I cannot shake the feeling I am watched and pursued at every turn.  

I understand if my failure precludes me from continuing any longer in your service. Please advise how you wish to proceed.  

Your loyal servant, Joel Aberbach

# EIDOLONS  

Acrober 8th (cont.)  

Daemonic aid. I hve alays despised those that sought it. I calle then weak, seish, willing to bring horor into the Realm of Mother Cosmos without regard for consequences. Daenons can grat ternble powers, bt the pnce is alvays too great.  

Isnit it?  

In Ciuvissna I had see daemons and peple working together to create a world fre from tyanny. Was it posible that the Mortal and Immortal Realms could sometimes want the same thing? Couldit be that daenons are not the evil of our depictions, bt rather an unaligned instment of chage, to be used by mortl agents for good or ill?  

I was alone, bond by iron chains in a shed whee no one Would find me. I knew thee was no altemative. My fingers felt for the item given to me in Civissina, which Id stored in ahip pauch. It was a nch wooden box inscrbed with the nnes of the dark gods. I did not knoweactly what it contaned, bt I knewit was my onl hope to aid thefate of beoming the next sacnfice to fuel the mad schemes of Cassia Sarki. I ako knew that by using it, I was fnaly joining the ranks of the desperate many who have called for daemonic aid.

I managed to unlatch the lid, and inmediately I sensed the release of the creature that had been trapped within. A mercunal shape arranged itself before my eyes. It floated mysteriously above the grund, a length of viscous, liquid substance, anathema to mortal physics, constanty flowing and changing. lmbs spruted at unlikely points, each ending in a grey flame. I recognised the Dark Fine. This Was an eidolon, one of the least understood forms that have been identified among the infinite daemonic multitude. They are said to be rarely found alone, as this one was.  

for many moments it squelched and ebbed inpassively before me, assessing me with eyeles judgement. Fnally it reached at a nplng tentacle and I felt the jet of inky flames take me. I had heard of this tnial by fire, bt the stories could not prepare me for the horror. I felt my soul consumed in the white laa of a dying star.

# SUCCUBI  

Acrober IIth  

I rode for Civissina like all the daenons of Hell were behind me - when in fact they were ahead. had abandond my duties for too long. I had not seen what was in front of my eyes. I had nsked the soul of an entire city for the sake of a few trifling faours.

I inord the sucubs as it cackled at my detemination. Mor of its brothers and sisters appeared along the road, each its own twisted vaniant on the same evil fonm - some with more than one head, others with strange fiuns or spines along their back. Teir numbers grw until they wee a great crowd clamuing like cats at the city gates. The Zalosi soldiers, meanwhile, had rteated to a more distant encanpment, and I could see their sentries watching nervously.  

I enteed Ciisina thrugh the seret tunnels Id been shown. The ity wasfar from the encouraging enclave of coperation it had been days prviovs. The bodies of victimsfr the sunmoning nituals rotted in the stets, the scet mingling withair thick vith bimstone.The sands of chanting, pntuated by the ocasional scam, could be heard from many of the houses and tenples.Fearfd eyes watched me from the shadows, and strange shapes could be seen in the marketplace and colonnades where once the peacefil inhabitants had waked. Now that it was encircled by daenmons, not men, the city walls had been abandoned, defences left unmaned.  

( hurried to what had once been the Doges palace. I found the old woman stricken on the floor of her chambers, blood flouing from dzens of deep slashes on her body. Sucubi scated from the room as I ented, chittering gleefully at their handiwork.  

"No,” I said, marching towands her."I do not pemit you to die Yu cannot let the city destry itself.Thee is Work to be done.

"The Patiianis aleady slain by one of his own. One who has see what I can see, who wilonus to brng the glittng glories of chaos to your Realm. Oh! Its so beautiful!"

The monastery was being rebuilt after the attack, and the Kepers were even more hshed and concerned than usual The elders did not blame me for my failures, saying that amies from Myra and Santa Regina were already on the way to purge the northem prouinces of this infestation. But I knew they would come too late. Something Would need to be done to save Civissina before they arrved - and (I feared for Zalos too, if Sarki were to turn her energies in its direction. I knew I must ignore the counsel of patience. I was the only hope of ending this before all was lost. ( retrieved the items I had come for and returned again to the road, clad once more in the hood and look of a Keeper.

# FURIES  

#  

Mou heard about the Pride of Santa Regina? I was on the ship what found her drifting. It's all true. Blood and corpses everywhere, rigging torn to shreds. Only one man left, hidden himself in a barrel of black powder. Wouldn't stop shaking. Said he was hunted by the armies of Hell. Said they were coming for him. Said there was nowhere to hide.  

We gave him some grog and eventually got him to stop mewling. Told us this grand tale. Said he'd been in the jungle of the South. There'd been a company out of Aguadulce. They'd found a city with these big step-pyramids, out in the Wrathful Mountains. Said the savages there have a big posh kingdom or some nonsense - had so much gold they didn't even see the value.  

They were heading back to their ships, all laden with treasure, when they'd found a small village. Just a bunch of huts, really. They stop for chow with the locals, all with feathers in their hair and strange marks on their bodies.  

Our man doesn't like it. He and most of the crew want to move on, it feels off. But the captain is in high spirits about the loot, and he takes a fancy to a village girl. He tells the men to make camp. Next morning, they wake up and there's this terrible stench of rotten eggs. They find the girl smiling, all covered in blood, holding a knife, and the captain's nowhere to be found. The men draw their guns and shoot up the village. They kill a bunch, but most of the tribe run into the trees. There's nothing else to do. They still have the gold, so they take it and move on.  

Well it gets to twilight and there's a scream from   
the back of the line. They turn to look, and one of   
the guys is on the ground, gurgling blood through e big hole in his neck. There's a swish through the trees - they think they see something big with wings - and a sound of mad   laughing. Someone says it's a pteradon. Another says that's not a pteradon, that's a giant vampire bat. But our guy - he knows there's no bats or reptiles that cackle like that.  

![](images/39aca637dedbb9a5c2a4aeb3a58e160de4a170233d0a32e2e66b3edf518a2129.jpg)  

There's another scream - now another guy has been impaled on a  

branch half way up the side of a tree. A couple of men shoot blindly into the jungle, for all the good it does. Soon they're running for their lives. About half the company gets picked off all gruesomely, and still they can't see the flying things that keep attacking and retreating.  

It gets so bad they're forced to drop the treasure. Finally they make it to the shore. They reach the Pride of Santa Regina.  

They look back at the trees - no sign of the creatures.   
They raise anchor sharpish and head for Arcalea.  

He said the daemons came again the first night at sea. He's certain that the witch girl unleashed the fiends of Hell against them. Called them “furies" like from the myths - said they come to punish wrongdoers and they never give up the chase. Said they'd killed the whole crew. There was nothing to shoot at in the dark. Just the sound of  

We took him home on the Dawn Star, and some of the lads tried to ask where he'd dropped the gold. "West" is all he'd say. Kept turning his head in every direction. The third day aboard, a flock of gulls passes the ship. He picks up a cannonball and jumps over the taffrail before anyone can stop him. How's that for a story, eh?  

Overheard on the docks of Port Roig

# HARBINGER  

Acnober 25th  

"How can I find the strength to carry on? wntes Sybellius in the margin of his grimoie. "It is notjiust the temptation of power - I mst rsist nothing less than the inevitable. They will destroy eerthing.  

TheCivissnadisterd nt ed thCaiaSankiineaienanstoil toldis pleAteug hin from the sacrficial pole, I carred him to the Zalosi encanpment and saw that he was cared for. The soldiers Wee ternfied.

But I was met by gnim fac.  

"Pease,” I tried again. "I cannot lose any more. They have taken too much fro me already.  

Still there was silence. Finally a large, weather-beaten soldier stepped forward.  

"No more daemons. Its too much, he said. And there were nods.  

"Civisina isnt our problem, said another. "We want to go home.  

Thee was nothing I could do. I watched as they began to pack up what was lft of the camp. Gnudgingly, I rtuned to the tul entrane toCiisina.

# Harbinger of Father Chaos  

Certain daemons are thought to serve the highest principle of entropy: the cosmic being we call Father chaos. These Harbingers have refused to be swept under the dominion of any Dark God and can appear solitary and mysterious even in the midst of a raging legion of freakish shapes. Not as powerful as those who have been lavished the lessings f a god, thy are nevertheless formidable warriors and potent mages, taking an array f forms across the daemonic spectrum and often electing to master lesser daemons as mounts. They always prominently display theFather's sigil,acting asa guiding beaconfor theirkin, not unlikea King's bannerman. Ever enigmatic, there is no record of any mage achieving a successful bargain with a Harbinger.  

# BANNERSOFTHELEGIONS  

The legions of the Dark Gods descend upon our realm like a tempest. Their larger hordes can rarely be sustained for long on the comparatively scant magical resources of this world, and yet their coming is remembered for generations. Tales are told of the most powerful and devastating daemons to stalk the mortal lands, standing out by their spectacular deeds or by sheer force of will from the infinite cauldron of the daemonic throng.  

Drawing on my decades of research and interviews, I will here describe several of the most notable daemons through history, and the coalitions they assembled. Since the essence of such monsters escapes back across the Veil when their physical forms are destroyed, these recognisable individuals may return several times over the arc of the ages, acquiring many names and titles and building up fearsome renown.  

Lesser daemons derive much of their identity from the more powerful creatures they are compelled to follow, and these notable Dukes of Hell have been particularly effective in crafting potent symbols and iconography to shape the forms and natures of the legions they command. In such a way can they impose their dominion over the chattering maelstrom of daemonkind.

# CACOPHRAX THEENTROPIC  

Cacophrax was a greater daemon of Sloth that decimated the Avrasi empire in ancient times. Half griffon and half alligator, it was said to be the size of a barn and yet it could float effortlessly over battlefields, dissolving people and buildings simply by looking at them. Cacophrax led a cross-pantheon coalition of daemons who all took abyssal black colouring, and their symbol was a spiral. The Avrasi historian Ptolemus has argued that Cacophrax was responsible for the famous and very mysterious disappearance of the Legio IX Destrana, and the loss of its eagles.  

# THEGILDEDGIANT  

This mythic creature, loyal to Sugulag, never took material form in our realm. Instead, the legends tell that it possessed an enormous golden golem the size of a Northern Jotunn. The statue was supposedly built by eastern dwarves before the united dwarven empire of the Golden Age, using techniques now lost to history. When it came to life, it brought minions across the Veil, which took similar metallic, mechanical forms, attending under the banner of an anvil. Its sole purpose appeared to be the raiding of gold, which it would haul away for unknown purposes. There are no records of the Gilded Giant from the Ages of Ruin, but in A.s. 788, reports reached Vetia of a giant statue that destroyed the Infernal citadel of Khazabkek on the Blasted Plain. Further details were repressed by the local dwarven Overlords.

# FOLOY THESKULLBRINGER  

Among the legions that have appeared at times of natural upheaval, Foloy is often prominent. The name is given by the ogres, who he decimated in the wake of the Inferno cataclysm - his best remembered manifestation. A giant red brute with horns, hooves and two living axes, Foloy is feared around the globe as an avatar of the Earth's rage, though there is nothing worldly about Vanadra's Tempest, as the elves call him. His followers are usually frightful, even by daemonic standards, coming with tentacles and every freakish form, always after earthquakes, eruptions, tidal waves or ferocious storms. His sigil is a skull with a blindfold across the eyes to represent the universal nature of Wrath's justice.  

# QUETZATOA THEDEVOUREROF THEDEEPS  

Resembling a monstrous hermit crab, Quetzatoa has never twice manifested with the same shell, but its enormous claws and belly are unmistakable in the annals of daemonology. Some say its lair is found beneath the tainted waters of the Shattered Sea, but sightings have been reported throughout the world. Leading piscine forces on seaborne attacks, the Devourer of the Deeps is a terrifying legend among sailors, seeking to consume any mortal that dares cross its ocean domain. Those who drown are said to feed its insatiable hunger. Loyal to the God of Gluttony, the Devourer's horde is extremely diverse, but all aquatic in appearance, and its barnacle-encrusted emblem is a crab's claw.

# TERGON THEPATHMAKER  

A hero in the tales told by the Warriors of the steppes, the Omen named Tergon Khan is known to have led great coalitions of both mortals and daemons against Tsuandan in centuries past. In the Tergonead, an epic poem, we read: Where he walks, light shines in his wake. Illuminated are his footsteps, and illuminated are we who come behind, bathing in Savar's glow. Thrice has he walked our world, gaining glories each more illustrious than the last. When he returns, grant that we may follow his golden tread, leading us unto majesty, and raise up the standards that point the way.  

# SCAROK THEMAGNANIMOUS  

![](images/93c8ddc4beb0f17421f70d89be386bea34a4de9ac5433268819596f956850d3b.jpg)  

A titan of Envy, Scarok's regular form is that of a drake, with scales that shimmer like a kaleidoscope. Her maw is ever curled in a knowing smirk, and she arrives attended by myriad reptilian forms that shimmer and scurry in her aura of self-adulation. She avoids open confrontation unless she is defied; instead, she seeks to corrupt the minds of the wealthy and powerful, visiting kings and merchants in secret, tempting them to look towards their neighbours with jealousy. It is said she watches the ensuing battles from above, cackling at the bloodshed. Her symbol of a forked tongue provokes both awe and fear among the dread elves, for she has come often to Silexia, but she is also known in Vetia ever since the Wars of Spite (355 to 378 A.S.).

# AKKA ZONO THEPUPPETMASTER  

Akka Zono has most recently appeared in Sagarika, but there are many legends also from Qassar and the Koghinan. Sometimes called the Sultan of Lust, it has a goat's head surrounded by many arms. While the devout have often described Akka Zono as the cause of evil thoughts and carnal desires, according to my sources its true function is not to create lust but to satisfy it, by manipulating the objects of affection into agreeing to the depraved proclivities of the naturally lustful. Many noble leaders have fallen to its wicked forms of persuasion and methods of control. Those who resist successfully often find themselves confronted by cohorts of deformed abominations, resembling overlarge children or animals with human faces, bearing Akka Zono's banners marked by a vertically bisected circle.

Acrober 28th  

Sister Dimitriou has alvays been a lone wolf, so I was pleased she acceted my offer to accompany her on her latest mission. Before his death, Father Miceli begged me to look after her, a task made almost impossible by her refusal to tell anyone what she was doing or where. Jhis time, I will be by her side. e have all been worrying. Leonora has barely slept or eaten since Civissina fell, and her right hand is a sickly grey colour from use of the rb of Al-Sahar.She must not be allowed to continye on her path of self-destruction.  

ur first stop was Zalos, where Leonora lead me to the hidden basement in which Sarki practised her evil arts.Jhe obsidian ball containing theSentinel of Nukuja was stillon its pedestal. eonora took it in her hands and entered a kind of trance.  watched over her for thirteen hours, meanwhile overseeing the destruction of the workshop's other artefacts. When she avoke, she flung the black orb on the flagstones, where it smashed, and felt a poverful presence vanish back across the Veil.  

"North,” she said, darkly.  

We began a trek into the White Mountains, leaving the horses with a dvarf trader when the way became too steep. ur cloaks are magically infused to protect us from spells, but they did little against the chillof the greatSonnstahl Pass.Finally, leading me to the summit of an isolated crag, Leonora stopped.  

"Jhis is where she came," she whispered.  

here was a temple there, although it hardly deserved such a name. It was a crude stone hovel, long abandoned, with a symbol over the lintel I did not recognise. We searched thoroughly all around, but could find no further clues. Nevertheless, it was growing

Acrober 29th  

Jhis diary was an ill-omened choice. Leonora is gone; I have failed Father Miceli.

"So this is the journal of eonora Dimitriou," the unsen presence chuckled, and I heard the rustle of papers. Leonora stood unmoving, and Iwas paralysed by horror. “How enlightening. You see much, young one."  

Fhe mountain wind whistled through the silence  

"Foo much,” came the wman's voice again, sudeny angy."You have guesd at my intetions and now you have but one choice. Join me or die ."  

Fhe silence continued.

Another payse,before the arnful voice spoke for thefinal time:  

"It is time to make your choice. In time, you willearn to see things as I do, when  send forth the Legions against Avras and you comprehend what I can achieve. r, you can die here, alone and forgotten by gods and mortals alike."
