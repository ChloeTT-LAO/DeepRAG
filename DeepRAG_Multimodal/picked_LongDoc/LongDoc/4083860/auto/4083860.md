Full details on how the scores are calculated are provided in the Technical Document, under the Supporting Documents section of our results page  

# Theme results  

The calculation for the immediate managers theme has changed this year due to the omission of one of the questions which previously contributed to the theme. This change has been applied retrospectively so data for 2016-2020 shown in the charts are comparable for this theme, however these figures are not directly comparable to the results reported in previous years. For more details please see the technical document.

# Theme results – Covid-19 classication breakdowns  

North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust 2020 NHS Staff Survey Results  

# Covid-19 questions  

Staff were asked four classification questions relating to their experience during the Covid-19 pandemic:  

![](images/5b062c15920668d40d2ede0f6c670c69ca2774bc0b31400ff21a4645ff10a617.jpg)  

The charts on the following pages show the breakdown of theme scores for staff answering ‘yes’ to each of these questions, compared with the result for all staff at your organisation. Results are presented in the context of the highest, average and lowest scores for similar organisations.  

# Comparing your data  

To improve overall comparability, the data have been weighted to match the occupation group profile of staff at your organisation to that of the benchmarking group, as in previous charts. However, there may be differences in the occupation group profiles of the individual COVID-19 subgroups. For example, the mix of occupational groups across redeployed staff at your organisation may differ from similar organisations. This difference would not be accounted for by the weighting and therefore may affect the comparability of results. As such, a degree of caution is advised when interpreting your results.  

# Further information  

Results for these groups of staff, including data for individual questions, are also available via the online dashboards. Please note that results presented in these dashboards have not been weighted where no benchmarking takes place and so may vary slightly from those shown in this report.

# Workforce Equality Standards  

North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust 2020 NHS Staff Survey Results  

This section contains data required for the NHS Staff Survey indicators used in the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) and Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES). Data presented in this section are unweighted.  

Full details of how the data are calculated are included in the Technical Document, available to download from our results website.  

# Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES)  

? This contains data for each organisation required for the NHS Staff Survey indicators used in the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES). It includes the 2017, 2018 and 2019 trust/CCG and benchmarking group median results for q13a, q13b&c combined, q14, and q15b split by ethnicity (by white / BME staff).  

# Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES)  

This contains data for each organisation required for the NHS Staff Survey indicators used in the Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES). It includes the 2018 and 2019 trust/CCG and benchmarking group median results for q5f, q11e, q13a-d, and q14 split by staff with a long lasting health condition or illness compared to staff without a long lasting health condition or illness. It also shows results for q26b (for staff with a long lasting health condition or illness only), and the staff engagement score for staff with a long lasting health condition or illness, compared to staff without a long lasting health condition or illness and the overall engagement score for the organisation.  

The WDES breakdowns are based on the responses to q26a Do you have any physical or mental health conditions or illnesses lasting or expected to last for 12 months or more? In 2020, the question text was shortened and the word ‘disabilities’ was removed but the question and WDES results still remain historically comparable.

The approach to calculating the benchmark median scores and the way in which the data for Q13d are reported has changed this year. These changes have been applied retrospectively so historical data shown in the average calculations and all figures for Q13d are comparable. However, these figures are not directly comparable to the results reported in previous years.  For more details please see the technical document.

# Appendix B: Signicance testing - 2019 v 2020 theme results  

The table below presents the results of significance testing conducted on this year’s theme scores and those from last year\*. It details the organisation’s theme scores for both years and the number of responses each of these are based on.  

The final column contains the outcome of the significance testing:  indicates that the 2020 score is significantly higher than last year’s, whereas $\blacktriangledown\Psi$ indicates that the 2020 score is significantly lower. If there is no statistically significant difference, you will see ‘Not significant’. When there is no comparable data from the past survey year, you will see ‘N/A’.

† The calculation for the immediate managers theme has changed this year due to the omission of one of the questions which previously contributed to the theme. This change has been applied retrospectively so data for 2016-2020 shown in this table are comparable. However, these figures are not directly comparable to the results reported in previous years. For more details please see the technical document.
