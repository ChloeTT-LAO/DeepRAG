# Concurrent Robin Hood Hashing  

Supervisor: Barak A. Pearlmutter  

# Motivations  

Make improvements on a 10 year old state of the art. Provide the first concurrent Robin Hood Hashing in the literature.  

# Contributions  

First linearisable concurrent variant of Robin Hood Hashing.   
Strong application of new K-CAS developments [Arbel-Raviv,, Brown; 2016]   
Competitive performance compared to state of the art concurrent hash tables.

# Hash Tables  

Constant time O(1) set/map   
structures   
Set operations:  

1. Contains(Key)   
2. Add(Key)   
3. Remove(Key)  

No need for sorting of keys, unlike tree-based sets/maps   
Require a hash function for keys   
Applications: Search, Object representation in VMs/interpretors, caches...  

# Hash Tables  

Divided into two camps: Open vs Closed Addressing.  

# Open Addressing.  

Items are stored in individual buckets only. If bucket is already taken find a new one: Collision algorithm.  

# Closed Addressing.  

Items are stored at original bucket only.   
Typically in a linked list structure.

If relocated item has bigger DFB than than current, kick current out, take spot, and recursively insert current further down the table.

# Method Chosen: K-CAS  

K-CAS is a multi-word compare-and-swap primitive. Each table operation is described as one large K-CAS.  

# Our Solution:  

Shardedtimestamps  

![](images/20e19d165934d5fcf57de150bc89fd2ae9b830eeafbae04891cd7dc6468479f3.jpg)  

Similar to lock-base sharding. Groups of timestamps protect the table.  

Each relocation operation increments the timestamp. Except relocations can be done in bulk.

Ugly little array is a deletion descriptor.  

Moves items. Increments two timestamps.

Reader misses V, due to deletion of Y.  

Reader sees timestamp change, restarts operation.

# Our Solution: Correctness  

Simple design means simple proof. Correctness is informally argued.  

Every modifying operation is a K-CAS operation. Cannot be seen midway.  

Every reader must remember every timestamp seen.  

Before any actions attempts to take effect they re-read timestamps. If any discrepancies are seen, retry operation.

# Our Solution: Progress  

Solution is obstruction-free/lock-free. Obstruction-free Contains, lock-free Add and Remove.  

Every operation checks timestamps before the operation completes. Timestamps are coarse so operations can impede each other.  

The impeding of Contains means potentially no Contains will pass, but at least one Add or Remove will get through.

# Performance Summary  

Robin Hood scales best in almost all workloads.   
Otherwise very competitive with Hopscotch Hashing. Comfortably ahead (10%) with 10% update load.   
More competitive (5%) with 20% updates. Robin Hood dominates other concurrent hash tables.   
Gap narrows during Hyperthreading.  

Transactional Robin Hood scales very strongly until Hyperthreading. Then it dies and never recovers.  

# Conclusion  

First linearisable concurrent variant of Robin Hood Hashing. Strong application of new K-CAS developments. Competitive performance compared to state of the art concurrent hash tables.  

# Future Work  

Extended Robin Hood work (different timestamp encodings/placements, cache aware, vectorised, various lock-based solutions)
