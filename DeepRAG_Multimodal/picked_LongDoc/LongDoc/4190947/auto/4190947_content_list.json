Therefore, severe valve stenosis requires a surgical operation with artificial heart valve replacement. Given that the geometrical differences between artificial valves would significantly influence hemodynamic performance around the implanted valve, additional knowledge for the interactions between blood flow and the artificial valve is necessary. Therefore, in order to proceed, this study proposes an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) technique to investigate artificial valve leaflet motion under different physiological conditions.

        "text": "Among various FSI technique, it is proposed to simulate the motion of the artificial heart valve with a fully-coupled algorithm and arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation (ALE) using a monolithic solver. Models are constructed using a realistic aortic root for both the bileaflet and bioprosthetic valves with additional modifications and considerations for the flexible arterial wall. Normal physiological blood pressure and conditions are used to simulate healthy scenarios, which are compared with experiments. Validation is conducted by analysing particle image velocimetry (PIV) experimental data from ViVitro Lab. Hemodynamic performance analyses are conducted and found that both velocity and maximum von Mises stress are higher if calculated using a rigid wall model. The leaflet dynamics, on the other hand, is relatively the same for rigid or flexible wall model. Clinically relevant scenarios are also simulated for both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves. The clinical focus for the mechanical valve is on the malfunction of the valve due to leaflet restrictions. In addition, the clinical focus for the bioprosthetic valve is on the systolic deficiency due to different tissue properties. ",

On average, assuming a constant heart rate of 72 beats per minute, the heart would pulse roughly 2.65 billion times when one reached an age of 70 years old. Given the functional importance of the heart, a surgical operation, either conventional or interventional cardiology, would typically require for a patient with cardiovascular disease, especially if the disease is related to the heart valve. According to Rizzoli et al., the overall survival rate for patients who received an artificial valve replacement drop from $75\\%$ to $29\\%$ at year 5 to 25, respectively[1]. They further found that with a total number of 3014 operations, there were approximately $11\\%$ (334 operations) of the cases belong to reoperations. Among the $11\\%$ of reoperations, there were approximately $75.1\\%$ (251 operations) were due to mechanical valve malfunction[1]. Furthermore, inspecting a series of data retrieved from U.S Department of Health & Human Service, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, that the U.S national heart valve procedures during the past decade have revealed a steady increase in number of patient discharged, shown in Figure 1.1; therefore, an improved understanding of artificial heart valve hemodynamic is beneficial for future studies.

The heart is divided into four chambers: the left atrium, the left ventricle, the right atrium and the right ventricle. There are four valves within the heart, each serves the common function to maintain unidirectional flow and prevents back flow of the blood, shown in Figure 1.2. Since the contraction of left ventricle would produce greatest blood pressure in order to send the blood into ascending aorta through aortic valve, it would be the primary selection to investigate aortic heart valve hemodynamic and valve performance. There are usually three leaflet cusps that made up of aortic valve: the left and right coronary cusps and the non-coronary cusp. The junction between the leaflet cusps and left ventricle is known as annulus, which is made of fibrous tissue. Several major complications that may lead to heart valve failures are aortic stenosis, valve leaflet calcification, or regurgitation. ",

An artificial mechanical valve is typically comprised of three main parts: a suturing ring for securing the artificial valve to annulus, a set of valve leaflet for preventing reversed blood flow, and a control mechanism for controlling the motion of the valve leaflet, such as shown in Figure 1.3.

However, several regions of mechanical heart valve are known to have stagnant blood flow that may be the site that originated thrombosis. This is the primary reason for patients receiving artificial mechanical valve to take anticoagulation medications for the rest of their life[3][4][6][7]. Moreover, hinge mechanisms of the mechanical heart valve have also been investigated and found to be prone for thrombosis and may require further improvements; therefore, the development of an artificial heart valve that could mimics the native heart valve without the increase of thrombogenic risk is considered as an alternative approach[3][4].

Although it is concluded that the Ross procedure has a low risk for thrombosis and endocarditis while maintaining a high survival rate, the necessity of reoperation limits the technique to younger patients[9]. A bioprosthetic aortic valve, as one of the alternative, is usually constructed with animal pericardium and developed for superior hemodynamic, such as shown in Figure 1.4. Due to the same trileaflet geometry from native aortic valve for the bioprosthetic aortic valve, the improvements in hemodynamic performance could be simply depended on minor design modifications of the commissure between each model. However, given that a bioprosthetic valve has superior hemodynamic performance than mechanical valves, the mortality rate is higher for patients who received a bioprosthetic valve[10][11].  The primary cause for a bioprosthetic valve failure or reoperation is due to structure deterioration, which might be caused by the decellularized valve leaflet under cyclic loading[5][10][12]. Therefore, the bioprosthetic valve is often selected for patients who are older given its outstanding hemodynamic performance without the requirement of antithrombotic therapy even though the overall durability is less than mechanical valve[6][10].

Depending on the scope of the problem investigated, a simulation that assumed a fully opened valve leaflets may be conducted in order to determine shear stress generated throughout a cardiac cycle[25][26][27][28][29]. More specifically, Grigioni et al. investigate a three dimensional laminar pulsatile flow integrated with a fully opened bileaflet mechanical valve and a realistic aortic root; however, the computational period only covers a portion of systolic cycle until peak systole[25]. Hsu, on the other hand, conducts a three dimensional Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes (RANS) using the two-equation k-ε turbulent model and concludes that wall shear stress significantly decrease with a modified suturing ring[28]. Moreover, Sirois and Sun conduct k-ε turbulent model for a fully opened bioprosthetic valve to evaluate the platelet activation due to shear stress[29]. Finally, Sun et al. investigate transcatheter valve deformation and distortion with a steady back flow, which applies to a fully closed valve with rigid wall assumption[30]. Although the flow around artificial valve might enter from transition to turbulent regime under high pressure gradient, a laminar or turbulent model would provide estimation on flow properties such as flow velocity and shear stress.

The main differences between a laminar model and a DNS model are the scales for time and length such that a DNS model would significantly increase computational resource required by refining the distribution of allowable mesh and time step.  Dasi et al. preform a three dimensional DNS with physiological conditions and validated against experiments using particle image velocimetry (PIV) for bileaflet mechanical valve [31]. Their DNS results have revealed flow instability and vortex streets during flow acceleration and peak systole while the deceleration phase showed a diminishing of coherent structures.

Since the fixed mesh method does not require remesh and mesh refinement and that the method is able to handle large structure displacement, the fixed mesh method has been adopted by several researchers for conducting FSI simulation on artificial heart valve[32][33][34][35][36]. However, since the fluid domain has a fixed background mesh while structure domain is on a separate grid, it is necessary to have high mesh resolution in order to produce an accurate simulation. On the other hand, moving mesh method, also known as Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation (ALE) , ensures a higher solution accuracy due to simultaneous boundary displacement for both fluid and structure domain[32]. Although, ALE method might require conducting mesh reconstructions during the simulation in order to maintain high mesh quality with higher computational cost and difficulty[32]. Due to higher accuracy with the application of ALE, researchers have adopted this method to solve FSI problems around the artificial bileaflet mechanical heart valve[37][38][39][40][41][42][43] and address different clinically relevant issues such as thrombogenic performance[38], experimental validation[39], and subaortic stenosis[41].

The benefit of applying partitioned approach is that the computational cost could potentially decrease depending on the coupling method of the solver[32]. Specifically, a loose coupled partitioned solver only required one iteration per time step using the solution from previous time, which solves the FSI boundary explicitly. The strong coupled partitioned solver solves FSI boundary implicitly using the solution at current time step, which might require more sub iterations in order to achieve a converged solution[32]. The partitioned approach, either explicitly or implicitly coupled, however, could create solver instability; therefore, it is required to introduce a relaxation factor to stabilize the solver for convergence. Furthermore, the stability is depended on the level of interaction between fluid and structure boundary. It is possible for a high level of sensitivity for interaction boundary that neither strong coupled nor loose coupled method could achieve a converged solution, which also depended on the relaxation factor[32]. The monolithic approach solves the entire problem at one single time step within one solver, which avoid stability issue created by partitioned solve. The computational cost and accuracy for monolithic approach, compare with partitioned approach, is higher due to a unified algorithm that solve the entire system simultaneously; thus, the approach is less attractive[46].

Assuming the relationship of time consumed for each time step relative to total number of meshes is linear, a computational domain consists of $2.08\\times10^{6}$ mesh element would require an average 83 minutes solution time for each time step. With a total number of time step required equals to 2952, the total solution time required to conduct DNS for one full cardiac cycle would be roughly $2.5\\times10^{5}$ minutes, which is equivalent to 170 days. Although this cost approximation for DNS computational time with FSI is an over estimation due to the maximum Kolmogorov’s scales chosen, it is clear that it is not feasible to conduct DNS based on the resource available. Therefore, laminar model with refined mesh distribution would be deployed in order to capture information on vortices as much as possible. Turbulent models, compare with laminar model, would require solving additional equations and consuming extra computational resource for identical mesh distribution. Therefore it was determined to use turbulent models for hypertension flow, which is out of the scope of this project. ",

However, since Fourier series interpolates the pressure profile based on given data series with the combination of sine and cosine function, the accuracy of profile magnitude and phase of the interpolated profile relative to the exact data series is decreased. Therefore, the final pressure profile from Fourier series would suffer from minor lag for pressure profile magnitude and time relative to the exact physiological pulsatile pressure profile with additional oscillation in pressure magnitude. In order to resolve the time lag due to the reconstruction of pressure profile using Fourier series, another method that applies cubic spline for pressure profile interpolation is deployed such that the reconstructed cubic spline function would smoothly pass through the data series obtained from exact physiological pulsatile pressure profile, shown in Figure 2.7. To reconstruct the inlet and outlet pressure profile from cubic spline, the generalized equation, shown in $\\operatorname{Eq}2-26$ , is applied to any two adjacent data points from the exact physiological pulsatile pressure profile.

Combining the two domains for a FSI problem would require a unified method to describe the frame of reference; therefore, the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation, or the free mesh formulation, is applied in order to account for large mesh deformation and motion. It is required to applied ALE method for a FSI problem when the problem is described with a free mesh deformation algorithm due to the limitations from the use of either pure Lagrangian or Eulerian algorithm. If problem is to be solved with pure Lagrangian algorithm, the surface and the boundary of the problem might be able to be deformed given the deformation of the interface would be relatively small. On the other hand, if the problem is to be solved with pure Eulerian algorithm, the mesh configuration for the computational domain would require a higher resolution in order to account of mesh refinements. Given the limitations for either Lagrangian or Eulerian method, the ALE method relates the time derivative between material and referential, which further relates to material and spatial domain, such that mass, momentum, and energy would be conserved.

On the other hand, the monolithic approach, which solves the system of equation within one step, provides a fully coupled solution with the additional cost of computational resource. Since a highly non-linear FSI problem would generate solver instability, the decision of selecting the monolithic approach may be in favor. Given the highly non-linear properties of the problem, the time step for the solver is automatically determined by COMSOL with self-adjusting time stepping, which decrease the time step as necessary in order to obtain a converged solution for one time step. With the convergence criteria for a stable time step are set to be within one percent, a properly configured solver could calculate an accurate solution throughout the whole cardiac cycle with additional cost of computational time. Moreover, with the ALE method applied to FSI model, the mesh for the whole computational domain would be moved as the FSI interface deformed with respect to boundary load. The distorted meshes due to moving interface during the cardiac cycle would potentially create inverted mesh elements that further decrease solution accuracy and increase instability of the solver; therefore, the quality of the mesh would need to be checked and re-meshed whenever the mesh quality dropped below the mesh quality criteria. As the solution is calculated with monolithic direct solver, the overall solution procedure is presented in Figure 2.9 with schematic flow chart. ",

In addition to general leaflet dynamics, Figure 3.9 shows two region of interest that reveals leaflet instability during cardiac cycle. The instability for the period when valve leaflets maintain at fully opened position, shown in Figure 3.9(a), occur after the peak-opening phase of $0.23\\:s$ as the leaflet position constraints are activated once the leaflet reached the maximum opening angle of 85 degree. Since the blood flow during the maximum leaflet opening period would be the maximum throughout the whole cardiac cycle, the instability is most likely caused by the flow entering transition region due to high central velocity jets, shown in Figure 3.6 at $0.23s$ , around mechanical valve leaflet. It is noted that the instability during peakopening phase could only be reproduced under an additional refined mesh configuration. This further suggests that small scale vortices due to transitional flow could be captured under finer mesh grids; therefore, in order to capture vortices in all scale, a DNS model will be necessary. On the other hand, the instability around the end-opening phase shown in Figure 3.9(b) have a different cause since the flow velocity is lower right after the closure of valve leaflets at $0.38s$ . Since physical constraints are applied instantaneously whenever the leaflet positions pass beyond the constrained angles in order to limit the minimum and maximum leaflet position, a large counter moment is applied to the valve leaflets such that the constrained boundaries at the joints of valve leaflet receive a large reaction force. Therefore the leaflets are modeled as striking against hard surface and resulting in leaflet rebounds, such as shown in Figure 3.9(b). As mentioned previously, this method does not require any additional geometrical complexities; however, the method introduces a small time lag in order to determine the precise time to activate counter moment.  The delay of counter moment activation could be observed in both Figure 3.9(a) and (b) at the time when leaflets reach either maximum or minimum angular position. To address the concern of constrain activation delay in this study, several control parameters are properly adjusted in order to reduce the artifact of position overshoot within an absolute maximum difference of 0.1 degree.

The central velocity jet between valve leaflets for flexible wall model has a decreased width and a decreased velocity magnitude by $0.3~m/s$ to $0.45m/s$ ; therefore, the velocity distribution is increased on the other side of the leaflets.

Based on the calculated velocity profile and shear stress distribution, the tissue valve indeed has a better hemodynamic performance than the bileaflet mechanical valve model presented in Chapter 3. Given the result presented for systolic period, the shear stress along the wall boundary is smaller than the critical value before blood cell damage; however, due to the computational restrictions, results during diastolic period cannot be calculated. In addition to the healthy models presented, investigations regarding the change in tissue properties are also conducted. It can be concluded that the increase in tissue stiffness would decrease hemodynamic performance dramatically as aortic sclerosis would lead to aortic stenosis.  Moreover, the stiffening of arterial wall would suppress the generation of vortices by suppressing the oscillatory behavior of leaflet motion, which may lead to the decrease in blood recirculation and particle deposition. In addition, the stiffening of valve leaflet would lead to early valve closure and decrease valve performance. Therefore, the changes in tissue properties, either for arterial wall or valve leaflet, have a major impact on the hemodynamic performance for bioprosthetic tissue valve. ",

Given that patients with higher age would have a relative higher risk of having a heart valve surgery, the selection procedure made by patients and surgeons is heavily based on the age of patients. With computational methods and patient-specific modeling, better predictions can be made based on the results of hemodynamic performance simulated. ",

Also, the pivots for mechanical valve leaflet are constrained with applied moment when maximum and minimum leaflet angles are reached; an additional formulation can be integrated into the equation in order to account for frictional force. In addition, the topography for tissue valve can be parameterized such that the model can represent various types of valve. Nevertheless, the existing tissue valve model can easily be modified to investigate hemodynamics of transcatheter valve. Finally, the model can be transformed into 3D such at the solution along three axis can be calculated. ",
