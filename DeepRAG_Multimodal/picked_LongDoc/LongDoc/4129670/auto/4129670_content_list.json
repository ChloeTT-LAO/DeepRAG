In the update from NYTWA, the debt forgiveness plan was further detailed to ask lenders to set the term of the loans to not exceed 20 years, with a fixed $4\\%$ interest rate and a monthly payment of $\\$757$ per month.  The plan language makes it clear that lenders are not mandated to restructure loans. Loan Guarantee: In return for forgiving the debt, the plan calls on the City to “backstop” the loans in the debt forgiveness plan to incentivize the lenders to restructure the medallion loans.  Based on the plan, the City’s guarantees of the loans should not exceed $\\$75$ million.  This would be the equivalent of 600 loans with a $\\$125,000$ balance.  There is no further information from the NYTWA or other reports in support of calculating the City’s exposure. Medallion Loan Forgiveness Debt Relief Act.  Rep. Gregory Meeks introduced H.R. 2077 on March 19, 2021 (this bill was H.R. 5167 in the last Congress). This legislation would provide some financial relief for taxi medallion owners by not considering debt forgiveness they receive as income.  This bill excludes from gross income, for income tax purposes, the income of a taxpayer, other than a C corporation, attributable to the discharge of qualified taxi medallion indebtedness.  When this legislation was first announced in January 2020, then-Congressman Peter King and Signature Bank announced their support for this bill.  The legislation is now co-sponsored by the entire NYC congressional delegation and has bipartisan support.  Given the change of leadership in the U.S. Senate in 2021, this legislation may move forward in the months ahead in the 117th Congress, and there is no reason to believe President Biden would not sign the legislation.

MaaS also allows transportation agencies to use new business models to organize and operate various transportation modes, giving agencies the added advantages of improved information on ridership and demand. For transit users, MaaS should be the “best value proposition” by meeting mobility needs while also solving the inconvenient parts of an individual journey (e.g., first mile/last mile). ",

Included in the City’s initial plan was an expansion of 20-mph speed zones in the City, changes to street design to discourage speeding, and City control of the placement and number of speed enforcement cameras.  As part of Vision Zero, the mayor also released the Green Wave plan in 2019, which focused on making cycling safer. It includes, for example, building 80 miles of bike lanes by the end of 2021. ",
