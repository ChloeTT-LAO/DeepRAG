Political revenue aside, we were also especially pleased with the $7\\%$ rate of growth in our core television local time sales excluding political revenues. With local sales the company can leverage its strong news operations to attract large overall viewing audiences throughout the day and thereby gain a disproportionate share of the individual market's revenue. This growth in the core local business coupled with the very strong political revenue helped to significantly increase 2004 total revenues and total media cash flow over the 2003 results. Total revenue increased $17\\%$ in $2004$ to approximately $\\$346.6$ million compared to $\\$295.4$ million in 2003.
