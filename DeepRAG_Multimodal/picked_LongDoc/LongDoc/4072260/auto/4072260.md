# Executive Summary  

Thank you for your interest in DefendX Software Mobility™. The latest addition to the DefendX Software® product portfolio, DefendX Software Mobility enables employees to tier files; users can select from a predefined set of criteria such as file size, age of last access, or other criteria (Right-Click Data Movement™), and organizations can also establish policies that automatically tier files as users reach their storage limits (Event-Driven Data Movement™). Both methods enable companies to control storage and operating costs and to expedite backups.  

DefendX Software Mobility makes it much easier for customers to control costs and consolidate data so that it can be searched and leveraged as needed. DefendX Software continues its innovation in file-based storage management with the ultimate objective of helping customers reduce storage capital and operating costs.  

# System Overview  

Your goal is to categorize your data, properly manage it, and move the right data to the most appropriate storage tier to reduce costs, address compliance issues, and perform electronic discovery. However, most archival solutions require expensive, repeated scans of the entire file system. Even worse, large, infrequently used files can reside in your primary storage for months! DefendX Software Mobility allows for flexibility in your approach to data migration with automated policy-driven movement, manual user driven movement, or a combination of both. You decide what is best for your organization. DefendX Software Mobility redefines the economics of data movement by being event- and policy- driven in real time, rather than requiring repeated scans of the entire file system, thus greatly helping to reduce storagerelated costs.  

# Browser Settings  

You need to have the "Allow Active Scripting" under  

Properties>Security>LocalIntranet>CustomSecurity enabled. This may require you to add the web admin's server to your local intranet sites. If this option is disabled then the admin site's left-hand main menu will not be able to expand.  

# DefendX Software Mobility Administration Site Configuration  

# Configuring Mail Settings  

DefendX Software Mobility can send out notifications to end users when their requests have been successfully completed. If you want the DefendX Software Mobility web application to send email notifications and alerts, then you need to provide the SMTP settings here.  

To configure the mail settings, perform the following steps:  

1. Under Notification Configuration in the left-hand main menu, click Mail Settings. The SMTP Server Settings section is displayed.   
2. Add in the SMTP server name, SMTP domain, and sender’s address. Enter the SMTP sender’s password only if the SMTP server uses secure authentication.  

# SMTP Server Settings

3. In the Address Resolution section, select the option to append the SMTP domain, use the Active Directory connector, or use the LDAP connector.  

# Address Resolution  

![](images/53b486a7667a0b640b8be080a543565ee68e783e239f44d1be30ac7016b6901f.jpg)  

The table below will help you configure the mail settings:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Field</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Append SMTP Domain</td><td>The user's email address will be determined by concatenating the user's login account name with the name of the SMTP DNS Domain specified above in the SMTP Server Settings.</td></tr><tr><td>Use Active Directory</td><td>The user's email address will be determined by looking up the user's account in active directory and extracting their primary email address.</td></tr><tr><td>Use LDAP</td><td>The user's email address will be determined by looking up the user in another LDAP database other than active directory. A search will be done based on the values returned by the LDAP Filter Name attribute against the user's account. If a match is found, then the user's email address will be extracted from the value of LDAP Mail Name attribute.</td></tr><tr><td> Primary Host</td><td>This is the name or IP address of your active directory or LDAP server that will be used first for searching.</td></tr><tr><td>Primary Port</td><td>This is the LDAP port number, usually 389.</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary Host</td><td>This is the name or IP address of your active directory or LDAP server that will be used second for searching. This is optional.</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary Port</td><td>This is the LDAP port number, usually 389.</td></tr><tr><td>LDAP Mail Name</td><td>Refer to Use LDAP. This is the name of the attribute used to store user email addresses, for example, mail.</td></tr><tr><td>LDAP Filter Name</td><td>Refer to Use LDAP. This is the name of the attribute used to store user names, for example, uid.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# NOTES:  

If you want the DefendX Software Mobility web app to send email notifications back to the users who sent a tier or recall request, then you must provide a mechanism for the web app to determine the user’s email address.   
The Primary Host and Port are required for the “Use Active Directory” or “Use LDAP Connector” options.   
The Secondary Host and Port are optional for the “Use Active Directory” or “Use LDAP Connector” options. If the user’s email address was not found using the primary server, then the secondary server will be searched.   
The LDAP Mail Name and Filter Name are required for the “Use LDAP Connector” option.  

# 4. In the Mail format section, select either HTML or Plain Text mail format.

# Core Tiering Engine in Brief  

The Core Tiering Engine works in conjunction with DefendX Software Mobility to tier files from one or more primary servers.  As with RCDM, the Core Tiering Engine gives administrators a method to tier aged files from servers.  The DefendX Software Mobility Administration site and corresponding Task Services must be configured in order for the Core Tiering Engine to tier files.  Based on the configuration, the engine can scan CIFS shares and NFS exports, identify files that meet the requirements to be tiered, then issue tier requests to DefendX Software Mobility (Administration web site).  The corresponding Task Services will process the tier requests that have been submitted to DefendX Software Mobility as would occur in any standard DefendX Software Mobility deployment.  

NOTE: The Core Tiering Engine must be installed on the Windows server for which the DefendX Software Mobility Task Service controls the tiering of the primary server’s files. To assign a Core Tiering Engine schedule and policy, click on the Edit Server link for the primary server on the primary servers page and enable Scanning for the Core Tiering Engine as well as assign the schedule. A policy can be assigned to each scan location added.  

# Configuring Core Tiering Engine Scan Policies  

The Core Tiering Engine Scan Policies allows you to control which files will be submitted for tiering by the Core Tiering Engine.  

To configure CTE Scan Policy, perform the following steps:  

1. Under Core Tiering Engine Configuration in the left-hand main menu, click Scan Policies.  

2. In the Core Tiering Engine Scan Policies, click New CTE Scan Policy or click the name of an already existing CTE Scan Policy to edit these properties.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">Core Tiering Engine ScanPolicies</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Threp</td></tr><tr><td>CTE Policy Name </td><td>Description</td><td>Server/Scan LocationCount</td></tr><tr><td>Default</td><td>Default tier can policy</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>New CTE Scan Policy</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

3. In the Name and Description section, enter a name and description for the Scan Policy. The name can then be assigned to one or more primary servers.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Scan Policy Name</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

4. In the Scan Policy section, specify the criteria by which DefendX Software Mobility can identify which files are tiered by the CTE. Files can be identified for tiering based on modified, accessed and created dates. Files can also be identified by file size and by file type settings.  

NOTE: DefendX Software Mobility can control which files are tiered by the Core Tiering Engine. Files can be identified for tiering based on modified, accessed, and created dates. Files can also be identified for tiering based on file size by selecting the Tier all files based on file size only option.  Each of the accessed, modified, and creation date settings below can be specified as either a number of months or a date.  

# Scan Policy

# Other Secondary Store Group Settings  

# NOTES:  

An optional File Types name can be assigned separately to each of the secondary stores. Files that match those file types will be tiered to that secondary store. You can assign different file types names if you want to tier files of different types to different locations.   
If the Requests are successful if files are copied to all secondary stores in the group is selected, then only when the file has been successfully tiered to all of the secondary stores will the file be stubbed.   
If the Requests are successful if files are copied to at least one secondary store in the group is selected, then the file will be stubbed if it has been tiered to at least one of the secondary stores.  

# Configuring Primary Storage  

# Adding a New Primary Server  

A Primary Server is a source file server used to access primary storage. The Core Tiering Engine will scan the primary server’s shares and select the files to be tiered based on the assigned policy’s criteria. Users connecting to the primary server’s shares will also be able to select files and folders for tiering using DefendX Software RCDM.  

When a new task service is installed, the primary server entered during the task service installation will be automatically added to the primary servers page within 60 seconds after the task service installation is complete. Primary servers that are automatically added will be configured to use the “Default” secondary storage group. ”  

The New Primary Server button can be used to add additional NAS or generic servers to an already existing task service installation.  

The New Primary Server button can also be used to re-add a primary server that was previously deleted by the web admin. To undelete a primary server, click the New Primary Server button and type in the name of the primary server and choose the correct task server. You can also select a different task server having the same type if you want to move the primary server to another task server.  

The task service installer for a NAS or generic server will prompt for the initial NAS or generic host name. This host name will automatically be added to the primary servers, as described above.   
If you want the same task service to control more than one of the same type of NAS or generic server, then use the New Primary Server button.  

To add a new primary server, perform the following steps:  

1. Under Primary Storage in the left-hand main menu, click Primary File Servers.  

2. In the Primary File Servers dialog box, click the New Primary Server button.

If a task server is not found in the drop-down list, then you must first install the task service using the DefendX Software Mobility Task Service for the applicable primary server type. When the installation is complete, the task server will appear in the primary server drop- down list.  

More than one primary server can be assigned to the same task service as long as the task service has full permissions to its shares and the primary server is the same type as the specified task server.

An additional text box will also appear for you to enter the name of the fail-over task server. Refer to the appendix for details on configuring tiering for a Microsoft Windows Cluster environment.  

# The following applies to Task Service for NetApp ONLY;  

Enable Pass-through Read when stubbing with the offline file attribute;  

If checked then when a user double clicks on a stubbed file containing the offline file attribute, the contents of the file stored in secondary storage will be passed through to the user keeping the stub file intact, i.e. without recalling the file back to primary storage.  

If not checked, then when a user double clicks on the stubbed file, the file on secondary storage will be copied back to primary storage overwriting the stub.  

# The following applies to Task Service for VNX ONLY;  

VNX Control Station Settings: VNX hosts require the IP address of its control station as well as the login credentials for that control station.  

# The following applies to Task Services for Generic ONLY;  

The optional Linux Settings are for future use and should be left unset.  

# The Core Tiering Engine (CTE) Settings  

The DefendX Software Core Tiering Engine must be installed on the same server as the Task Server defined above.  

To enable the CTE to scan the specified primary server, the CTE must be set to enabled and a Scan Policy and Scan Locations must be defined. The Scan Schedule is optional if you do not want CTE to scan based on a schedule.  

CTE can be configured to scan all CIFS shares and/or all NFS exports that are found on the primary server by selecting the Scan All Locations radio button.  

If you want CTE to scan specific locations then select that radio button, enter a Scan Location along with a policy and press the Add button.

Domain Name: The name of the domain to scan. This must match the root domain in your environment as display by the Active Directory Users and Computers application.  

Domain Type: Currently $^{\prime\prime}{\sf A D S I^{\prime\prime}}$ , Active Directory Services Interface, is the only domain type that is supported, i.e. only active directory domains can be scanned.  

LDAP Port: Port 389 is the default port for ADSI. If your domain uses a different port then enter it here.  

Task Server: This is the name of the Windows server where the Domain Agent was installed to.  

Domain Login Id: A login Id and password are optional. If the Domain Agent’s service account does not have permissions to the domain then you can enter an account here which has permissions. This account will then be used to scan the domain.  

Scanning: If you want the Domain Agent to scan this domain then you must enable it.  

Scan Schedule: If you want the domain to be scanned on a schedule then choose a schedule.   
Schedules are defined under the “Scheduling Configuration – Schedule Settings” page.  

Scan Type: A scan type of “Normal” will collect domain attribute information for each user scanned and will store them in the Mobility stores database. A scan type of “Simulation” will collect information but will not store anything in the databases. This can be used to collect information of what will be collected.  

Scan Entire Domain: When this is selected then all users in the domain, starting from the root, will have their attributes collected.  

# Product Installer  

There are two new pages to support the product install feature. “Primary Storage – Task Servers” page and the “Additional Configuration – Product Installer Settings” page.

# Account Configuration  

Use the Application Accounts section to define the Windows accounts that are exempt from being able to auto-recall files from secondary storage. This is used to prevent applications that backup files on the primary servers or scan for viruses from recalling all files stubbed with the offline file attribute from secondary storage. Instead, the backup applications will backup the stub file without recalling its contents, and the anti-virus applications will scan the stub file instead of recalling its contents.  

To add an exemption account, simply type in the name of the application’s service login account and press the Add button. These accounts are global, i.e. used by all task services.  

# Application Accounts  

![](images/da06098218f47cb686d5e9351ab0dddfd1c7f183c5af26e1b3cd2158a89e3045.jpg)  

# Additional Configuration  

When the DefendX Software Mobility File Intranet, Recovery Portal or Access Portal Websites are used, the user is presented with a choice of options. One of the options is to recall or recover a tiered file to the download location. The default download location is defined at the DefendX Software Mobility File Download UNC outlined. Each primary server can be set to use this default location or use its own location which can be defined in the primary file server page.  

![](images/2a71f8998206f23958e76408ec3cbd2c41d96c4027bf1e05e16d710ed6f56255.jpg)  

The Task Service for VNX requires the EMC CAVA services to be installed as well as the Proxy Service. These services are needed to provide auto-recall support for EMC VNX servers version 7.1.74.5 and later. A single instance of Proxy Service is capable of providing autorecall support for multiple EMC VNX servers. Enter the NetBIOS name of the server which has the Proxy Service installed. Each VNX primary server can be set to use this default server or use its own proxy server which can be defined in the primary file server page.

# Viewing Queued Requests (On-Demand)  

This page displays all the pending requests that have been submitted by the Right-Click Data Movement (RCDM) application or the Event-Driven Data Movement (EDDM) application. There are three types of requests, Tier, Recall, and Recover. Each request is assigned an ID for which you can drill into and view additional information. Requests are also stamped with the time it was submitted along with the primary server the request was issued for. Pending requests can also be placed on hold until released and they can be removed.  

To view queued requests, perform the following steps:  

1. Under Status in the left-hand main menu, click On-Demand Status>Queued Requests. The Queued Requests page is displayed.

# NOTES:  

Queued requests are sitting in a queue waiting to be serviced. Pending items will get processed in a sequential order.   
On-hold(Manual) means the item was placed on hold manually, i.e. by using the Hold button. Items that are manually held will not be processed until the administrator releases the hold on the item.   
On-hold(Network) means the item was placed on hold by a task service due to a network issue while trying to tier or recall an item. When the network issue is resolved then these held items will automatically be released by the task service.   
It is possible to place network held items on manual hold by selecting the items and pressing the hold button. When doing this then those items will be held until manually released.  

3. To move an item from queued to on-hold, or to release an item from hold, simply check the Select column and then click either the Hold or Release Hold button. Administrators can put tiering requests on hold, release the hold, or delete the requests.
