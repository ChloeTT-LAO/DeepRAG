We began with the set of priorities that were previously listed on the Laurel WID website2 (water quality and water rights).   \n2. We  reviewed  all  Laurel  WID  board  meeting  minutes  back  to  January $2015^{3}$ to collect relevant statements and decisions made by the WID board and grouped those statements or decisions into priority topics (comprehensive planning; drainage; flood management; habitat; outreach; representation; water quality; water quantity; water rights).   \n3. We added priorities identified in the February 2016 work session and described in the Laurel WID Agriculture-Watershed Characterization and Mapping Report4 (habitats and species; water flow processes; agricultural land protection).   \n4. The list of priorities and potential priority actions was revised after the WID Work Session held in Lynden on March $20^{\\mathrm{th}}$ , 2017.   \n5. We built a master spreadsheet listing the main priorities that had been identified and discussed by the WID in all of the various processes mentioned above.  Where the WID board had also discussed or decided on near-term actions associated with a priority, we included those in the spreadsheet.  The master spreadsheet is available as an electronic document and provides the raw material for the suggested priorities described in this section.   \n6. We generated a set of suggested priorities (see Table 1 below), and then added desired outcomes and near-term actions using draft wording drawn from previous WID documents, statements and decisions (see Table 2 below).  The material in these tables serves as a starting point around which the WID board could build their Management Plan and associated actions.   \n7. We also compared the list of WID priorities to relevant policy statements and goals in two related planning documents, namely the Whatcom County Comprehensive Plan (2016 update)5 and the WRIA1 Watershed Management Project’s statement of goals (2008).6  The goal statements in these two planning documents offer additional context for the Laurel WID’s own priorities, and are shown alongside the suggested WID priorities in Appendix D.   \n8. We attended the Tenmile Watershed Forum held at the Whatcom Conservation District on 1 March 2018, and added information from that event to the tables of suggested priorities, and to the section in this Plan on previous and current watershed management efforts in the Tenmile watershed.

The Tribe’s territory included the major part of the Nooksack lowland. Many well-defined trails northward facilitated their trade with the Sumas, Chilliwack, and Matsqua bands of British Columbia, as well as The Hudson’s Bay Company at Fort Langley. The Nooksacks also conducted more limited trade with tribes to the south and west, the Semiahmoo, Lummi, and Skagit.10  A trail from Bellingham to present-day Everson known as the Whatcom Trail was used to access clamming areas, and other shellfish grounds, on Bellingham Bay and also to conduct trade between tribal communities on Birch Bay and in Canada.11 Another trail stretched from Dakota Creek in Semiahmoo territory east to the Kamm Creek watershed and then roughly north to Canada.12 Native Americans also used the extensive waterways of a huge wetland complex between Fishtrap Creek and the Fraser River to travel.13 ",

According to the author, Mr. Johnson told Mr. Myers that before Europeans settled the area deer and elk were plentiful and the Nooksacks “trapped muskrats, mink, otter and beaver.

However, there were muskrat living in the banks of the creek, and mink in the area as well.  Cotton-tail rabbits were common. Raccoons, mountain beaver, fox, skunks, weasels, squirrels, and chipmunks also lived in the area.  The author goes on to list the birds she commonly encountered at Tenmile.

Her grandfather, Hans Seiness, dug a well to keep milk, cream, and butter cool, and built a cellar to store “potatoes, apples, carrots, onions, or other garden produce.”63  In the 1890s, there were 30 to 40 orchards within a four-mile radius of Ferndale, and the cannery and condensery industries grew.64 ",

This report presents water use information by smaller sub-basins: Fourmile (which includes the Lake Fazon area to the east and outside of the WID area), Tenmile, Deer Creek, and Wiser Lake/Cougar Creek.  A small percentage of water use is metered.  The highest level of metered use is in Tenmile, where it accounts for about $5\\%$ .  The rest of the use if modeled.  Agricultural use is dominant in all areas but residential use accounts for about $10\\%$ in the Wiser Lake/Cougar Creek and Fourmile areas, a little more than that in Tenmile, and about $25\\%$ in the Deer Creek area.  A relatively small amount of water use is attributed to commercial enterprise in the Fourmile, Tenmile and Deer Creek sub-basins. ",
