# Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan: Consultation Statement  - Appendix 4  

Dear neighbour,  

# Neighbourhood Planning Regulation 14 Public Consultation – Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan  

I am writing to inform you that in accordance with Neighbourhood Planning Regulation 14, the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Forum is undertaking a public consultation and would like to invite comments from organisations and individuals on its Pre-Submission Neighbourhood Development Plan.  

The public consultation runs from March ${8}^{\mathrm{th}}$ 2018 until April $19^{\mathsf{t h}}$ 2018.  

The Steering Committee of the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Forum has produced a Neighbourhood Development Plan which covers the whole of Oulton and Woodlesford.  The Plan contains a vision for the villages along with a set of aims, planning policies and proposals and community actions to achieve the vision. The planning policies within the Plan seek to protect the character of the villages, with policies guiding new development, notably for housing, business, and greenspace.  

Following this consultation, the Plan will be amended and then submitted to Leeds City Council, as required, for a further “Regulation $\displaystyle{16^{\prime\prime}}$ consultation and independent examination. The Plan, if successful at examination, will then proceed to a local referendum. If the Plan receives a majority vote, the Plan will then be ‘made’ and become part of the statutory development plan – the Local Plan - for Leeds. Any planning applications submitted within the boundary will be determined in accordance with this plan.  

# Aim of this consultation  

This consultation seeks your views on the content of the proposed Oulton and  Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan.  

# Availability of Documents  

The proposed Oulton and  Woodlesford  Neighbourhood Development Plan can be viewed on the Forum’s website at www.oawnf.org  

Hard copies of the proposed Oulton and  Woodlesford  Neighbourhood Development Plan are also available for inspection at the following locations: our local post offices, the Rothwell One-Stop Centre, the Rothwell Sports Centre, the Oulton with Woodlesford Parish Hall, the Methodist Chapel, Woodlesford, Oulton Institute, Leeds Mobile Library, the Temple Lawn Community Centre.  

# How to Comment  

The Forum welcomes your comments. Comments should be submitted, preferably using the Survey Monkey questionnaire link on our website (www.oawnf.org) or by completing the attached paper questionnaire and leaving at The Oulton Institute, Quarry Hill, Oulton.   Written representations may be delivered to the same address or sent by way of the Forum’s website.  

The deadline for comments is April $12^{\mathsf{t h}}$ , 2018.  The Forum cannot accept any late comments.  

# Further Information  

Should you have any further queries about the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan please contact us via the Forum’s website or send a letter the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Forum, Oulton Institute, Quarry Hill, Oulton, Leeds LS26 8SX  

# The Forum’s Objectives  

The Forum’s Constitution recognises the objectives of the Neighbourhood Forum as:  

• to agree a long term vision for the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Area.   
• to promote and improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Area.   
to represent the people who live, work or carry out business in the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Area.   
• to produce a Neighbourhood Plan for the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Area in conformity with the local development plan and the national planning policy framework.  

# The Plan’s vision for 2033  

Our vision is for Oulton and Woodlesford to be a pair of conjoined villages that share a wide range of services and facilities and offer a high quality of life through great educational, recreational and working opportunities for all. The  villages have a wide range and diversity of high quality housing stock and are surrounded by high quality and accessible countryside and the well maintained and highly prized parklands. A significant feature that epitomises our twin urban and rural character is the canal corridor which now provides a wide range of excellent recreational opportunities.  

Listed below is a list of the Policies contained in the Plan, - the Plan itself contains the supporting evidence for these policies and a number of important appendices which are listed at the end of this Newsletter.  

# Housing.  

# H1a: Smaller homes  

New housing developments, containing more than 10 units, should contain at least $50\%$ smaller homes (i.e. homes having a maximum of two bedrooms).  

# H1b: Affordable homes  

New housing developments, containing more than 10 units, should:  

a) Contain at least $20\%$ affordable homes.   
b) Ensure  that  affordable  homes  are  intermingled (“pepper-potted”) with the other homes.   
c) Be delivered either on the development site or elsewhere in the NeighbourhoodArea.  

# H2: Design of new housing developments  

New housing development should have regard to the following:  

a) Developments should reflect the scale and layout of adjoining neighbourhoods. New developments should have individuality and avoid “Open Plan Anywhere Suburbia” and should include a mix of single storied housing, terraces, and yards.  

b) Developments should provide adequate off-road parking, designed so that vehicles do not dominate house frontages, either within the curtilage of new homes or through the provision of on street bays and other areas dedicated to car parking and that do not serve to clutter the street scene or act as an obstruction to the free flow of vehicles and that are located within the development site. Provision should be as follows: 1 or 2 bedroom units – 2 spaces; 3 bedroom units – 3 spaces; 4 bedroom and larger units – 4 spaces.   
c) Developments should be designed with the security of residents in mind.   
d) Developments should have high standards of insulation and should conform to the Passive House Standard of near carbon neutrality.   
e) House builders are encouraged to have pre-application consultation and engagement with both local residents and with the Forum’s Steering Committee. This should normally lead to a pre-application design code. If the house builder then wishes to make proposals that are at variance with consultation inputs, an opportunity to discus these with residents should be afforded.   
f) New housing developments should contain no more than 40 units in any phase of development, in order not to overwhelm surroundings and to encourage variety in  the urban landscape.   
g) Each development proposal of 10 or more units should contain at least $20\%$ of either single storied units, or two storied units adapted for independent living.  

# H3: Design principles for identified site allocations  

Development proposals for the following locations should have regard to the  following  design principles:  

a) HG2-176. Windlesford Green Hostel, Holmsley Lane, Woodlesford: There are mature trees on the site that should be protected.  Preference for this sites to be developed  as flats as this would allow a higher density (possibly upto 40 units). Ground floor flats should be suitable for persons with limited mobility.   
b) HG2-177. Alma Villas (site of), Woodlesford LS26 8PW: There are mature trees in the site that should be protected. The site slopes and is also an awkward shape. Vehicle access via Alma Street is poor. A small part of the site is Green Belt which could be retained as green space. Development of this site could contain a larger number of smaller units than the Leeds Site Allocation Plan proposes.   
c) HG2-178. Aberford Road - site of Glenoit and Minerva Mills, Oulton: Small business premises would be viable on this site together with flats. By building flats instead of houses, the capacity of the site could be increased considerably. The canalside location would make it an ideal location for one or more restaurant.   
d) MX2-14. Aberford Road (77/79), Oulton LS26 8HS: The site is classified for mixed development. About half the site currently houses a garage and car showrooms. The southern part of the site is likely to be available and should be developed to strengthen the Oulton village hub. The site would be ideal for extra care housing. It is well situated for this, being near to shops, post office and a café and on a bus route. Such a development will increase the site’s capacity. The frontage on to Midland Street (approximately $30\mathsf{m}$ ) also has potential for development.   
e) HG2-179. Fleet Lane/Eshald Lane: The draft Site Allocations Plan identifies this site for housing, but the Forum believes this site is ideal for allotments as there are only a  few allotments in the Forum’s area and a waiting list for these.   
The following site is not favoured for development by the Forum but should it proceed then the   
following design principles should apply:  

HG2-180. Fleet Lane/Methley Lane: In the event of this development being taken forward, we do not wish to see it developed piecemeal, but instead as a number of separate developments, each containing no more than forty units. Before planning applications are submitted, the Forum wishes to reach agreement with developers for an overall plan for the area including the position of the school and traffic management. Landscaping and greenspaces which accompany any development should be carefully designed in order to mitigate the impact on the Special Landscape Area, the adjacent Conservation Area and the Green Belt. Serious consideration should also be given to the impact of HS2 which runs adjacent to the site and particularly close in the NE corner and how the impact can be mitigated.  

# The design of the built environment.  

DBE1: Design of the built environment  

The following principles should apply to all developments:  

a) Development proposals  should respect local architecture and valued heritage assets.   
b) Development proposals should preserve and enhance the Conservation Areas in line with the Oulton and Woodlesford Conservation Area Appraisal Management Plans.   
c) Loss of garden setting and infill development will be resisted from development particularly in the Conservation Areas.   
d) Large, mature trees in gardens and on streets provide a soft backdrop for views within and into the village. These should be maintained or, where lost, be replaced on a like for like basis.  

For each individual Character Area, all developments should demonstrate how proposals  meet the stated “Aspirations for Neighbourhood Plan policies” as identified in Appendix 1.  

Character Areas are defined as:  

Oulton village   
Woodlesford village   
Pottery Lane   
Beechwood and the Northwoods The   
Lynwoods   
The Maltings   
All Saints   
North Oulton   
The Eastfields   
Derwent Avenue and Langdales   
The Parkways   
Holmsley Grange   
South Oulton   
Oulton Hall and Park and St John the   
Evangelist Church   
Water Haigh Country Park  

DBE2: Develop village centre shopping and leisure environments  

In order to facilitate the cohesive and sustainable growth of the Neighbourhood Area, development proposals will be welcomed which support a more integrated, high street style village centre on Aberford Road, Oulton from the Calverley Road/Aberford intersection through to Clown House (former Ritz Cinema).  Developments should have regard to:  

a) Improved safety for pedestrians and vehicle users   
b) Enhanced the built environment of the street scene   
c) Encourage greening of the street scene   
d) Maintain a balance and mix between residential and commercial property   
e) Prioritise mixed development on any new development site in this area   
f) Promote commercial foot-fall through physical improvements to pedestrian access, street scene and car-parking.   
g) Favour new commercial activity in use classes A1-A3.   
Development proposals at the commercial centre on Church Street, Woodlesford, should be in line with existing use classes in this location and support the ongoing sustainability of this smaller village centre.  

The local non-designated heritage assets detailed in Appendix 3 of the Plan have been identified as being important in the local community Any development proposal that would impact upon an identified feature should consider their heritage value and have regard to how the proposal will contribute towards the sustainability of the affected asset.  

# Community services and facilities  

# CF1: Community facilities  

The following community facilities will be registered as Assets of Community  Value  with Leeds City Council. The change of use of these facilities will only be permitted if it can be demonstrated that reasonable efforts have been made to secure their continued use for the current purposes and/or alternative provision is made:  

St John the Evangelist church, Oulton   
Methodist Church, Woodlesford   
Oulton Institute, Quarry Hill, Oulton   
All Saints Parish Hall, Woodlesford   
Methodist Chapel, Oulton   
Oulton & Woodlesford community sports   
club  

Rothwell Leisure Centre Oulton Primary School Woodlesford Primary School Royds School, Oulton  

# CF2: Sports facilities  

Development proposals should seek to  

a) Protect and enhance, as well as promote and improve accessibility to established formal sport facilities (leisure centre, sports clubs) and informal all-age exercise and play facilities.   
b) Encourage the provision of new and replacement sports facilities.   
c) Where existing facilities are improved or enhanced – for example, through the provision of a replacement Rothwell Leisure Centre – every effort should be made to ensure that disruption of services is minimised to the community andusers.   
d) Demonstrate demand and support from the community.  

# CF3: Educational facilities  

Support will be given to proposals whose purpose is to facilitate the development of educational facilities, in particular:  

a) The growth of educational facilities on their current sites  where this does not lead to the unacceptable loss of recreational open space or cause unacceptable amenity loss to neighbours. b) Proposals that deliver a public library function, supporting educational establishments in the neighbourhood area.

The following identified green corridors will be improved and protected for the multiple  benefits derived from them for the community. Development proposals should not result in the disruption of the functioning of these corridors:  

Leeds Special Landscape Area • Aire and Calder Navigation/ River Aire corridor  

# GE2b: Green infrastructure  

Development proposals should seek to integrate strong green infrastructure, including:  

• New accessible public green spaces for formal and informal recreation. New green space should seek   
to address identified deficits in the area and/or vicinity of the development.   
• Retention of hedges, trees and landscape features.   
• Retention of existing street trees and those ‘off street’ which form part of the street scene and provision of new trees wherever practicable. Existing trees in the street scene should be conserved and replaced on a like for like basis should felling be deemed inevitable.   
• Provision of porous surfaces wherever hardstanding is required off the carriageway.   
• Provide corridors for wildlife to move through, around or across a development site.  

# GE3: Protecting views in the landscape  

Development proposals should respect and maintain key views across the area, as identified in the Oulton and Woodlesford Design Statement, Conservation Area Appraisals and illustrated on the Policies Map, in order to maintain the character and appearance of the area. a) Views out to the surrounding countryside are important to the east side of the Conservation Area. The flat topography is a feature of the long distance views.  

b) Significant views from Methley Lane to Oulton Park and the spire of St John the Evangelist Church; also across to Oulton village and its Conservation Area both from Methley Lane over Oulton Beck and from Fleet Lane with the spire again in the background.   
c) Panoramic views from Leeds Road to the south and west.   
d) The view of the spire of St John the Evangelist Church and Oulton Park from Parkways Avenue provides an interesting vista.   
e) Top of North Lane has excellent long distance views down the hill. The wide verges add a sense of openness.   
f) The tree at the junction of Quarry Hill and Midland Street is the focal point of the views down Oulton Lane.   
g) From Beechwood and Northwood there are dramatic views across the Aire Valley to Temple Newsam.   
h) The view of Woodlesford Village set on its hillside from across the river from the A642 and Bullerthorpe Lane.   
i) Views into the village along Aberford Road announcing arrival into Oulton.   
j) Views to the open countryside over the river and navigation, link Woodlesford with its setting. Leventhorpe Hall is a particular feature of these views.   
k) Views from Oulton Hall across Oulton, Woodlesford and the surrounding areas.  

# GE4: Improve access to Public Rights of Way  

All new developments proposals should seek to provide safe pedestrian access to link up with existing or proposed footpaths, ensuring that residents can walk safely to bus stops and other village facilities. All new development should demonstrate how it contributes to improved off-road and nonmotorised accessible routes that:  

• Serve to link the villages together.   
• Provide for improved access to the surrounding countryside.   
• Link the villages to nearby communities and facilities outside the neighbourhood area.  

# Business and economy  

# BE1: New business and employment development  

New business development is welcomed in the village centres identified in Policy DBE2 and illustrated on the Policies Map where this:  

a) Provides greater diversity in the commercial/retail sectors (shops, restaurants).   
b) Provides new small "start-up units" for businesses.   
c) Encourages the development of a local visitor/ tourism economy, particularly in canal corridor locations.  

# High Speed Rail  

# HSR1: Managing the impact of the development phase  

During the period leading up to and during construction through the Neighbourhood Area, the developer and their contractors should seek to limit adverse environmental impacts upon the community and its environment. To this end, prior to the period in question, the developer shall:  

a)  develop a sustainable development policy setting out  defining  principles  regarding all aspects of operations and how potential impacts will be avoided or mitigated in respect of all areas where  

there is potential for impact, i.e.  

agriculture, forestry and soils;   
air quality;   
climate change;   
community;   
ecology;   
electromagnetic interference;   
health;   
historic environment;  

• land quality; landscape and visual; major accidents and disasters; socio-economics; sound, noise and vibration; traffic and transport; waste and material resources; and water resources and flood risk.  

b)  Engage with local authorities and other stakeholders to identify additional potential regeneration opportunities within the Neighbourhood Area.  

# HSR2: Design, community and the landscape  

The promoter and the nominated developer(s) will seek to ensure that:  

a) Design contributes to the government’s pursuit of sustainable development, as set   out in the National Planning Policy Framework, which involves seeking positive improvements in the quality of the built, natural and historic environment, as well as in people’s quality of life, with reference to the following elements where impacts are possible:  

agriculture, forestry and soils;   
air quality;   
climate change;   
community;   
ecology;   
electromagnetic interference;   
health;   
historic environment;  

land quality; landscape and visual; major accidents and disasters; socio-economics; sound, noise and vibration; traffic and transport; waste and material resources; and water resources and flood risk.  

b) Design of all visible elements of the built and landscaped environment  are sympathetic to their loca context and to the environment and setting in respect of the local community; c) The design is developed through engagement to seek peoples' views and ideas on the aesthetic design of the visible buildings and permanent structures;

Oulton & Woodlesford Neighbourhood Forum Regulation 14 Questionnaire  

Q4 “Our vision is for Oulton and Woodlesford to be a pair of conjoined   
villages that share a wide range of services and facilities and offer a high quality of life through great educational, recreational and working   
opportunities for all. The villages have a wide range and diversity of high   
quality housing stock and are surrounded by high quality and accessible countryside and the well maintained and highly prized parklands. A   
significant feature that epitomises our twin urban and rural character is the canal corridor which now provides a wide range of excellent recreational opportunities.”Do you agree with the Vision?

<html><body><table><tr><td>24</td><td>The vision does not give an indication of a plan for the future. What are the issues that similar communities in the UK are facing? Employment, housing, public transport, healthcare? How are we going to set ourselves up to tackle these issues in the near future? What is a pair of conjoined villages? Joined up villages make towns. We either want to maintain a village or become a town to attract business opportunities and growth. If people want to live in a village then resist conjoining the neighbourhoods together. insist that new housing estates have their own character and commercial area. The wording of the vision implies that we wish to bury our heads in the sand and ignore potential isues and keep the village feel. The vilages have already been decimated. I grew up in vilages and this is not a village - i is a commuter belt for one of the largest cities in the UK. Where was this passion when a church steeple was demolished and replaced by 1 large luxury house? Why is there not more support for small business in terms of rents and rates to support more like the butchers in Woodlesford if a village feel is sought after? A Lidl supermarket is not in line with this vision. The villages are just outside the Leeds City bus ticketing area meaning that most households in this area find it cheaper to run a car.

This could be explored further with a intermediate rail station between Woodlesford and Castleford to take some of the strain off the local station.

Former Glenoit Site - HG2-178 - The draft envisages this site should be developed by building flats. It is agreed that the inclusion of some flats on this site would be a sensible inclusion in a mixed development. However, the emphasis on flats does seem to contradict the comments within section 3.3.2 of the draft, where it is stated "the locality is therefore unsuitable for developments displaying uniformity etc".

Urgent attention is needed to address the dangerous pressure on roads around Woodlesford Lock as tourism is encouraged but not supported or met by the Canal And River Trust and the local council to the detriment of road safety and local residents, who have to contend with long term parking outside their front doors - as in days at a time, not just hours - and urinating in public on Pottery Lane, as well as the traffic jams and access problems which have worsened considerably over the past few months. This is exacerbated by parking issues on all the roads around Woodlesford Station,which is a matter of great urgency and increasing danger and public nuisance.</td><td>4/11/2018 12:00 PM</td></tr></table></body></html>

Therefore the two dates should be stated together and alongside each other so the information is clear.

To enable growth you need to have the infrastructure in place, which worries me that this won't be completed properly.

# Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan: Consultation Statement  

APPENDIX 7  

# LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS  

Dear Sir/Madam  

# Neighbourhood Planning Regulation 14 Public Consultation – Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan  

I am writing to inform you that in accordance with Neighbourhood Planning Regulation 14, Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Forum is undertaking a public consultation and would like to invite comments from organisations on its Pre-Submission Neighbourhood Development Plan.  

The public consultation runs from March ${8}^{\mathrm{th}}$ until April $19^{\mathsf{t h}}$ 2018.  

# Proposed Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan  

The Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Forum has produced a Neighbourhood Development Plan which covers the whole of the designated area of the Oulton and Woodlesford Forum.  The Plan contains a vision for 2018 – 2033 along with a set of aims, planning policies and proposals, and community actions to achieve the vision. The planning policies within the Plan seek to protect the character of Oulton and Woodlesford, with policies guiding new development, notably for housing, business, greenspace and the environment.  

Following this consultation, the Plan will be amended and then submitted to Leeds City Council, as required, for a further “Regulation $\boldsymbol{{16^{\prime\prime}}}$ consultation and independent examination. The Plan, if successful at examination, will then proceed to a local referendum. If the Plan receives a majority vote, the Plan will then be ‘made’ and become part of the statutory development plan – the Local Plan - for Leeds. Any planning applications submitted within the boundary will be determined in accordance with this Plan.

The successful designation of a Local Green Space relies to a large extent on providing evidence that the spaces are "demonstrably special" to the local community. It is important to note that the NPPF states that a Local Green Space designation will not be appropriate for most sites. It is acknowledged that an assessment of proposed Local Green Spacesis appended to the draft Plan although there are gaps in the "local significance" column.

It is important to note that boundary plans are provided in the Appendix although they are not shown on Map 2 (and should be shown here, too). The boundary plans provided in the supporting appendix are sometimes unclear and refer to multiple different "patches" of green space as a single space. This approach has been used in the SAP Green Space proposals but only where the site is contiguous but separated by, perhaps, a through-road. Dispersed "patches" of green space being referred to as a single site is not recommended. A number of the proposals are verges adjacent to roads. It would be difficult to convince an examiner that these are "demonstrably special" with clearly identified characteristics that justify their inclusion. It would be helpful if more details were included in the analysis table relating to why the proposed areas are special.

As you will be aware the Neighbourhood Plan area lies within the current defined coalfield. According to the Coal Authority Development High Risk Area Plans, there are recorded risks from past coal mining activity, including 13 mine entries recorded and likely unrecorded coal workings at shallow depth and surface coal mining activity. It is noted that the Neighbourhood Plan does not propose to allocate any sites for future development and therefore we have no specific comments to make. However, if allocations are proposed in these areas in the future then consideration will need to be given to the coal mining legacy risks present and how the development will need to respond to these risks in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and the Leeds Development Plan. In addition any allocations on the surface coal resource will need to consider the impacts of mineral sterilisation in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and the Development Plan.</td><td>This all looks OK No action needed </td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Hallam Land </td><td>The Coal Authority wishes the Neighbourhood Plan team every success with the preparation of the Neighbourhood Plan. We write on behalf of Hallam Land Management in relation to their land interests on land off Fleet Lane, Oulton (Leeds SAP Site Reference HG2-180). We welcome the opportunity of responding to the Pre-Submission consultation draft of the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Plan and hope that our below comments will be taken into consideration. We are in broad agreement with the Vision and Key objectives set out in 2.1 and 2.2, and note that the plan period of 2017 - 2033 aligns with the emerging plan period of the Core Strategy Review. We do however consider that reference should be made in the introductory text and / or the 'delivering the plan' text to the emerging Core Strategy Review and how the Neighbourhood Plan will be monitored and reviewed in line with the Leeds Local Development Plan, in order to ensure alignment between the neighbourhood plan and the Leeds Local Development Plan. H1a: Smaller Homes This policy requires at least 50% of new housing developments above 10 units to be one- and two-bedroom homes. We object to such a prescriptive policy which is contrary to Core Strategy Policy H4. Core Strategy Policy H4 is worded to offer flexibility, whereas Policy H1a sets an unjustified 10 dwelling threshold and is inflexible and should acknowledge that such a mix may not always be possible. The delivery of a mix of houses within a new development scheme is supported however the mix is reflective of need and demand, and is different on a site by site basis, based on the scale and location of the development. Whilst Policy H1a aligns with Core Strategy Table H4 which provides a 'target' of 60% one and two bed properties, this is not borne out in such a prescriptive manner in Core Strategy H4. Further flexibility is required in the wording of Policy H1a H1b Affordable Homes We recognise that whilst the threshold of 10 units is below that in the Core Strategy Policy H5 it aligns with the emerging Policy H5 in the Core Strategy Review which has been reduced from 15 dwellings to 10 dwellings (which aligns with the emerging NPPF).</td><td>This site has now been removed from the SAP Insert reference to Core Strategy Review Our Plan only applies to the sites within the Forums area scheduled for more than 40 dwellings.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Policy is based on the SHMA (2017) and Economic Viability Study 2017. Regardless of the lack of justification for a 20% requirement, there does not appear to be any viability work undertaken to prove that a 20% requirement in the neighbourhood area is viable. A difference of 5% over and above the District requirement could render new development schemes unviable, leading to the non-delivery of schemes. The policy requirement should be reduced to align with the Core Strategy and emerging Core Strategy Review requirement of 15%. Policy H2 Design of new housing developments: We have no objections to parts a, c, and d of this draft policy; however we object and have concerns with parts b, e, f, and g, which are contrary to Policy P10 of the Core Strategy, and collectively have the danger of rendering housing allocations unviable and undeliverable. Part b) Car Parking. While we have no objection to the reference to providing adequate off-road parking, we do object to the specific requirement in the policy of the provision of: 2 spaces for 1 or 2 bed dwellings 3 spaces for 3 bed dwellings 4 spaces for 4 bed+ dwellings This provision is onerous and unjustified / unsupported by robust evidence. The large number of spaces required is contrary to national government aims of reducing car usage, hence why new homes are located in sustainable areas, accessible by public transport and close proximity to local facilities. The reference made in the supporting text to this policy on page 24, to the Leeds Street Design Guide parking requirements, and how the “observations of parking in new developments in the Forum's area provides evidence that this figure is now outdated.." is not justification to significantly increase the requirements, in particular for 3 and 4+ bed dwellings. The Leeds Street Design Guide provides two methods in relation to calculating the number of residential car parking spaces, both of which have a maximum of 2 spaces per dwelling, with less spaces for 1 and 2 bed properties. The provision of parking spaces over and above those set out in the Street Design Guide will lead to a requirement for further land to meet the housing requirement, as fewer dwellings will be deliverable on allocated sites due to the curtilage increase to accommodate parking spaces. The parking requirement lacks flexibility and makes no reference to visitor parking. We suggest this policy is re-worded to align with the Local Plan and evidence base in the Street Design Guide. Part e) Pre-application consultation Applicants are required to undertake community consultation for proposed development schemes, the detail of which is included in the Council's </td><td>Evidence - look at any new development and see We have no cars already being parked on pavements. evidence ar See comments to Leeds input "The current level of behind our on-street parking I the Forum's newest development, Applegarth Manor, Fleet Lane, is already excessive. It is naive to think that this policy will discourage car usage. Commuters using public transport will leave their cars behind. To encourage better use of the rail links, better parking needs to be provided at Woodlesford station. A car is necessary to make use of Leeds Park and Ride facilities."</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Statement of Community Involvement. The scale of community engagement is generally proportionate with the scale of the proposed scheme. The first part of Part e is acknowledged; however it is unclear what a 'pre-application design code' is and we require further information on this aspect of the policy, which appears to go beyond the policy requirement in the Core Strategy and emerging Site Allocations Plan ('SAP'). Part f) New housing developments should contain no more than 40 units in any phase of development. We object to this policy request. There is no explanation or justification for a 40-unit threshold, nor is there any evidence that a scheme of more than 40 dwellings will'overwhelm surroundings' or harm variety in the urban landscape. Restricting a development phase to 40 dwellings has the potential to hamper the delivery of Site HG2-180 which has a capacity in the emerging SAP of 322 dwellings and will not necessarily divide into phases of 40 dwellings. Such a restriction on delivery into phases of 40 dwellings could have an impact on the delivery of the infrastructure associated with the scheme (affordable housing, public open space, education). We therefore suggest that this element of Policy H2 is removed. Part g) Each development proposal of 10 or more units should contain at least 20% of either single storied units, or two storied units adapted for independent iving. We object to this policy which lacks justification or evidence to support such a requirement and is contrary to Core Strategy Policy H8. Core Strategy Policy H8 expects developments above 50 dwellings to contribute to supporting needs for Independent Living. There is no percentage requirement for specific house types. There is no justification in the supporting text to part g of this policy for a 10- dwelling threshold, nor is there any justification for a 20% requirement of either single storey or adaptable two storied units. Summary of research at paragraph 3.1 informs that "bungalows are around 8% of the area's housing stock, 25% higher than the city average." Therefore, there are clearly more bungalows in the existing housing stock in the neighbourhood area compared with the average in the District. It is suggested that part g is revised to make reference to encouraging developments to support needs for Independent Living in alignment with Core Strategy H8. Policy H3 Design principles for identified site allocations: It is disappointing that the Plan refers to the Forum not favouring Site HG2- 180 of which there does not appear to be any reasoning or justification provided. We would welcome the reasoning behind the lack of support. We do have some concerns with the wording of the design principles within Policy H3 part f relating to Site HG2-180, which in part stem from </td><td>More explanation of the justification of this policy has now been included in the Plan The arc4 assessment highlights the needs of an ageing population. The provision of accommodation suitable for older residents removes some pressure from providing more specialist accommodation for assisted living. Estate agents also highlight the demand for bungalows, with quick sales for properties placed on the market.</td><td></td><td>More explanation now included.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>requirements in Policy H2, as commented on above. We do not agree with the wish that the site should be developed as a number of separate developments, each containing no more than forty units. Whilst it is likely that the site will be developed in phases, until further detail on masterplanning is undertaken, the size of the most logical phased delivery of the site is unknown. This policy restricting a single phase to 40 dwellings is unworkable and unduly prescriptive. Given the scale, site HG2-180 will need to be comprehensively masterplanned, taking into consideration the site requirements as listed in the emerging SAP. Masterplan work will take place in dialogue with the Council pre and post application submission, and the Neighbourhood Forum will undoubtedly also be invited to comment and contribute to the masterplanning process. The various matters identified in part f of Policy H3 have been taken into consideration and are acknowledged and referenced in the emerging SAP (e.g. school positioning; traffic management; landscaping; conservation area and HS2). 3.5.3 Education provision Reference should be made within this introductory text to Policy CF3 to the potential for an additional school which will be delivered via the development of site HG2-180. We trust the above comments will be given due consideration and look forward to further dialogue with the neighbourhood forum in the next stage of the Neighbourhood Plan preparation.</td><td>Our reasons have been given in full as part of the SAP consultation and are in the public domain. For brevity we have not repeated them here.

We are among the largest charities in the UK. Our vision is that “living waterways transform places and enrich lives". The Trust has a range of charitable objectives, including: To hold in trust or own and to operate and manage inland waterways for public benefit, use and enjoyment; To protect and conserve objects and buildings of historic interest; and To further the conservation, protection and improvement of the natural environment of inland waterways.

<html><body><table><tr><td>The Trust note that the Neighbourhood Plan makes special reference to the canal corridor and makes special reference to the need to maintain the green infrastructure associated with the canal corridor. The Trust are confident that the policies proposed are based on a desire to protect this valued asset and it welcomes this. However, the Trust does have significant concerns that the designation of land next to the canal as Local Green Space may have unintended consequences, which could prevent future proposals to enhance the enjoyment of the canal. This may include the provision of visitor facilities, including the provision of facilities to enhance the use of the waterway for boaters, watersports, and fishing; and changes to the use of moorings to allow the mooring of boats that could promote tourism on the waterway. The Trust note that policy BE1 'New Business and Employment Development' seeks to encourage the development of a local visitor/tourism economy, particularly in canal corridor locations. The Trust has concerns that the designation of land next to the waterway as Local Green Space could have the unintended consequence of being in conflict with the aims of policy BE1 and would potentially sterilise the ability for the Trust and the local community to promote activity upon the waterway. Specifically, as an example, the Trust note that paragraph 3.7.1 (part f) mentions aspirations that include the potential provision of a visitor information centre/café next to Woodlesford Lock. This would be within part of the proposed Local Green Space within parcel CSE. A café/visitor information centre building would impact upon the openness of the site. Therefore, the designation of the land as a Local Green Space could prevent the delivery of this facility, as it could be viewed as being contrary to the policy requirements set out in paragraph 76 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) for development on such designated spaces. Paragraph 77 of the NPPF sets out three tests that must be met before land can be designated as local green space. The Trust considers that insufficient evidence has been provided to justify the designation of long stretches of land adjacent to the canal as Local Green Space. In order to be designated as such, the area of land must meet all the qualifying criteria set out in paragraph 77 which states that the: "Local Green Space Designation will not be appropriate for most green areas or open space. The designation should only be used: Where the green space is in reasonably close proximity to the community it serves; Where the green area is demonstrably special to the local community and holds a particular local significance, for example because of its beauty, historic significance, recreational value (including as a playing field),</td><td>Olders</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>tranquillity or richness of its wildlife; and Where the green area concerned is local in character and is not an extensive tract of land". It is the opinion of the Trust that the stretches of land within WH1, CSE and </td></tr><tr><td>CSW do not accord with the above tests and consequently should not be included within proposed local green space designation. Sections of CSE and WH1 being considered for the designation are not within close proximity to the villages that the plan relates to. Land to the north of CsE is separated from the village of Woodlesford by the Aire and Calder Navigation and it is of serious concern to the trust that there is no direct safe pedestrian access across the canal. The Forum should note that the locks are unofficial crossings, do not form a safe or convenient route and should under no circumstances be identified as doing so. Additionally, parts of WH1 next to Lemonroyd Marina are more than 1.2km from the closest village boundary. The Trust has been unable to identify where justification has been provided as to why these land parcels (WH1, CSE and CsW) are "demonstrably special", or hold particular local significance. No evidence has been provided to indicate that there is a discernible difference in appearance, character or heritage value of these stretches of land to those adjacent areas not considered for the Green Space designation, either within or outside of the neighbourhood plan area. The Trust believe that the size of the proposed land parcels exceed what could properly be defined as local in character' as required by the paragraph 77 of the NPPF, and make up extensive tracts of land. Both CSE and WH1 comprise of several hectares of land, and all three of the tracts of land next to the waterway proposed are over 1km in length. The Trust is unclear as to the rationale behind the designation of WH1, CSE and CsW as Local Green Space. The Trust is a Statutory Undertaker with Slders</td></tr></table></body></html>
