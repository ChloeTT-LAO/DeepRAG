# WELCOME MESSAGE  

I will like to express my profound sense of gratitude, privilege and honour for being requested to give the inaugural message for this pioneering initiative of skills-knowledge-technology dissemination platform, what has been named as International Conference on Start-Up Ventures for Technology Developments & Future Strategies. (SV-TDFS-2018).  

I, on the behalf of my organizing team, invoke all the participants to take full advantage of this forum which has been created for the first time in the history of the region in sync with the PM‚Äôs vision of empowering the nation by creating an eco-system for nurturing interdisciplinary-scientific and technological entrepreneurship in this country with immense potential and prospects  

The prime focus of this conference is to create a sustainable problem-solving platform for the start-ups in the domains of Electric Vehicles, Smart Systems Pharmaceutical, Allied Engineering, Functional Device Technology, etc.  

I hope that this initiative is continued for years to come, seeing the urgency of the time which demands that systematic handholding of all the budding and blooming technological entrepreneurs be done by the leaders of the nation.

# Abstract:-  

Purpose ‚Äì The purpose of this work is development of future scaled FinFET for low power and high performance circuit design. As Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors and circuits are deployed at remote locations and works at high frequency band, the application also requires real time solution. The power is also the prime issue in IoP applications because these are battery operated or selfpower devices. The Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) based semiconductor device fulfill all above state requirements. Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) used to reduce the power need and Indium (In) is used to improve the performance of the device hence InGaAs fulfil the need of IOT applications.  

Design/methodology/approach - As InGaAs is the compound material that can be fabricated on Silicon wafer and fabrication technologies for InGaAs device is already proposed and successfully fabricated by many researchers. In this work, To develop the device, first deposit InAlAs using sputtering then deposit thin film of the InGaAs using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The laser lithography is used for device dimension. The ion etching is used for device pitch development. The device dimensions are shown in Table I as per the ITRS prediction for 2019.  

Findings ‚Äì This device provides very good performance and also reduces huge power budget moreover it also allows high-k material as gate insulator like hafnium oxide (HfO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), magnesium hydroxide $(\mathrm{Mg}2\mathrm{O}3)$ . that further reduces the gate leakage current. The

also helps to increase the gate control over channel hence increases the inversion charge. These inversion charge increases the ON current.  

Research limitations/implications ‚Äì The InGaAs based NMOS device has around 2200 to 4000 cm2 /Vs mobility but PMOS has around $600~\mathrm{cm}2$ /Vs hence this is the major disadvantage but it is very useful with domino logic.  

Practical implications ‚Äì Write now it is pure simulation work for process testing and application of the work in the next phase we will fabricated it at Indian nano user program (INUP), Govt. of India at IISc Bangalore center. We have already submitted the project.  

Originality/value ‚Äì It is original work and design and develop as per the exiting CMOS technology hence it can directly use with the CMOS fabrication technology along with silicon also.

# Abstract:-  

Study of the response of an HVDC system to various conditions, types and locations of fault on the system is basic to developing suitable protection techniques and algorithms. This paper presents a study   of the behavior of monopolar HVDC system in the presence of a single doubletuned dc filter. CIGRE Benchmark model for monopolar HVDC system has been simulated on PSCAD/EMTDC for the study. Five different fault locations, viz. three dc line faults (two faults near the line ends and the third fault at the middle point of the line) and two ac side faults (one near the rectifier and the other near the inverter), and five different values of fault resistance (ranging from 0 to 2000 ohms) have been considered. It has been observed that incremental current and incremental power in the HVDC line can discriminate only mid-line dc faults from ac fault. Also, incremental current can discriminate between rectifier-side ac fault and inverter-side ac fault for all values of fault resistance, whereas incremental power can do so only for lower values of fault resistance (0 ohm and 10 ohms). Transient energy can discriminate dc line faults at all locations from ac faults with all values of fault resistance. However, transient energy can discriminate rectifier-side ac fault from inverter-side ac fault only for low values of fault resistance (0 ohm and 10 ohms) and not for high values. This study can be very effectively used in developing a protection algorithm/algorithm. The study can be further extended to analyze the performance of HVDC system in the presence of any type of the dc filter and for any length of the line.  

Keywords: - Fault Resistance, Incremental Current, Incremental Power, PSCAD/EMTDC, Transient Energy.

# Abstract:-  

Monitoring and control of climatic variables inside a greenhouse (GH) play crucial role in quality production of crops in the green-house (GH). Measurement and monitoring of major GH variables, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light intensity and CO2 in atmosphere, has been generally carried out using a central data acquisition system to which all sensors are individually wired. This technique involves huge cabling and lacks flexibility of adding sensors in future.  This paper presents a detailed methodology and results of experimental measurement and profiling (both temporal and spatial) of temperature and luminosity inside a laboratory model of GH using a wireless sensor network (WSN).  

For the experimental work, the GH was divided into two rows, row 1 and row 2, with three zones of equal dimensions in each row. At the center of each zone one wireless sensor node was placed for measurement and acquisition of temperature and luminosity in that zone. A WSN was created with these six wireless sensor (WS) nodes (or motes) and one network coordinator (NC). Profiling of temperature and luminosity was carried out under uncontrolled as well as controlled environmental conditions. Two controlled conditions were created. In the first case only temperature was controlled by placing a heater at the center of GH. The second case involves simultaneous control of temperature and luminosity, for which an incandescent lamp was placed in each zone of row 1 while all the zones of row 2 were   covered with a tinted plastic sheet. Data was gathered from all the six WS nodes in each controlled case as well as in uncontrolled environment. Surface profiles of both temperature and luminosity were drawn in Lab VIEW on

the basis of collaborative processing of the data. The experimental results so obtained are correlated with the expected theoretical profiles.  

The use of WSN and Lab VIEW for collecting and processing the data, respectively, provides remarkable flexibility in terms of addition and deletion of WS nodes. Moreover, no wiring is needed for power or signals.

# Abstract:-  

Utmost of elucidation about the research accomplished in an article is cleared from the objective function of the planning problem. An objective function is a mathematical expression which describe the existing condition of a system with numerous variables, in which alteration of these variables result in optimized value largest or smallest, depending on the problem or desired value. That value may be obtained by minimizing or maximizing the objective function. In this paper, a review has been carried out on objective functions of distribution network expansion planning (DNEP). Besides most prominent objective, i.e. investment or expansion cost minimization, a numerous other objective functions are also listed and elaborated in the paper. These objective functions have been classified into five main categories: financial, income related, technical, optimal size & location and social & economic objectives. The selection of objective function clearly shows increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG), distributed energy storing systems (DESS) and fuel cells with renewable technologies. Most of the reviewed articles regarding DNEP highlight these objectives in details, however; not all fields have been covered in any single work on DNEP. This review article aims to address this gap so that widespread DNEP can be achieved with flawlessness. Most of the objective functions are in practice today while others are still under exhaustive investigation. This survey article recommends utilizing these classifications to obtain impeccable DNEP. Substantial information has been offered of research work done in the field of DNEP through this review article which will mitigate the impending researchers from the difficulties of getting apposite supervision.

# Abstract:-  

Purpose ‚Äì The purpose of this work is to prepare Diclofenac Sodium tablets $50\mathrm{mg}$ and generate a comparative evaluation using direct compression and wet granulation techniques. Design/methodology/approach ‚ÄìDiclofenac Sodium solid tablets $50~\mathrm{mg}$ were formulated by two methods namely, (i) Direct compression using two different DC grades (Directly compressible) for each formulation and (ii) Wet granulation using conventional excipients. Tablets were prepared and assessed for description/appearance, flow properties, hardness, friability and disintegration time (DT).  

Findings ‚Äì All the formulations have shown the results within specification limits. However, the tablets which were produced by direct compression method disintegrated very rapidly when compared to those prepared by the wet granulation method and appearance was good with smooth finish without any rough surfaces.  

Research limitations/implications ‚Äì The Direct compression method is used for the low dose drugs and the active pharmaceutical ingredients which are thermolabile and moisture sensitive. Direct compression also helps in minimizing the unit operations, with improved yield and enhancing the tablet quality.  

Practical implications ‚Äì The method is useful to enhance product stability, improved appearance of product, faster DT and decreases the production time and manufacturing cost phenomenally.

# Abstract:-  

The growing environmental concerns of fossil fuels and their unavoidable depletion have led to search for alternative renewable resources which can help to reduce country‚Äôs energy dependency. Moreover, biofuels being environmentally safe, has an enormous potential to replace conventional petro-fuels. Biobutanol is one of the interesting biofuels that offers many advantages over bioethanol like higher calorific value, low vapor pressure, and good affinity with gasoline in varied ratio. However, conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process observed major challenges viz. low butanol concentration, yield, productivity, and solvent intolerance resulting in a high overall production cost, thus impeding its commercialization. To alleviate these concerns, effect of stimulator namely folic acid was investigated in present study to enhance butanol titer. Initially, different concentrations were screened and $10~\mathrm{\mg/L}$ folic acid supplementation showed highest butanol production of $10.78~\mathrm{g/L}$ with total solvents to be 18.91 $\mathrm{\bfg/L}$ . Folic acid addition was also optimized to get surplus improvement in final product concentration. Overall, a significant step up in biobutanol production was accomplished by induction of essential cellular components

# Abstract:-  

Antennas for off-body wearable applications needs to be flexible and its electrical characteristics should be stable in different body postures, different bending or stretching environments. Therefore, the designed antenna should be such that, even if the antenna is bent frequently, it should operate properly. In this paper, a conformal UWB antenna is reported which has been optimized to be conformal to any body shape and size. The proposed antenna has been designed on RT Duroid substrate with dielectric constant of 2.2 and loss tangent 0.0009. The thickness of the material is $0.127~\mathrm{mm}$ . Due to low thickness; it can easily be bent and mounted on curved surfaces. The size of the antenna is $35\times31~\mathrm{mm}2$ .  To accomplish the design process, two different bending radii have been considered to bend the proposed antenna. The two bending radii of $25\mathrm{mm}$ and $50~\mathrm{mm}$ have been chosen; one corresponding to the arm of a healthy child of around 5 years age and another corresponding to a healthy person of age about 35 years with medium built. The simulated radiation efficiency and total antenna efficiency are more than $60\%$ for the bending at $25\mathrm{mm}$ and $50\mathrm{mm}$ radii in the UWB frequency range from $3.1\mathrm{GHz}$ to $10.6\mathrm{GHz}$ . The gain of the proposed antenna for both the bending radii is changing from $1.4\:\mathrm{dB}$ to 5.3 dB. The return loss of the proposed antenna is obtained for $25\mathrm{mm}$ and $50\mathrm{mm}$ bending radii of curvatures and it is below $10~\mathrm{dB}$ in UWB range. A prototype of proposed antenna has been fabricated and tested on Rohde & Schwarz 40 GHz VNA. Measured results are in close agreement with simulation results.

# Abstract:-  

Carbon black is used in various formulations with different elastomeric material to customize the performance properties of materials. However, with increasing demands for performance improvement, growing competition, and imminent government regulations, carbon black is unable to fulfil the stringent requirements. Besides, as a filler, carbon black has limitations in terms of performance enhancements, and a large filler content is often prescribed. To this end, this study has focussed on development of Thermally Exfoliated Graphene Oxide (TEGO) reinforced engineered natural rubber (NR)/poly butadiene rubber (PBR) blend nanocomposites. Ultrasonication assisted latex mixing process was used to incorporate the nanofillers. Further, high speed mechanical perturbation and probe sonication were employed to ensure efficient dispersion of TEGO nanofillers, followed by co-coagulation of the nanofiller dispersed latex blends.  A systematic variation of TEGO content was carried out to investigate the effect of incorporation of the nanoparticles within the elastomeric matrix blends. The microstructure and static mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were then evaluated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies indicated possible chemical interactions between the functional groups present in the blended elastomers and TEGO. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed microstructural details of the nanocomposites which in turn could be attributed to superior mechanical behaviour of the developed elastomeric nanocomposites. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) further revealed

# Abstract:-  

With the growing demand for high quality software in industries with lower time complexity and lower requirements for memory consumptions, the need for identifying the defects in the software cannot be ignored. The software development industry deploys huge manpower to estimate, detect and resolve the defects in the software to match the customer requirements and ensure the quality in the product. The process involves development and testing in iteration to detect the defects in the software. However, the process of detection and resolving the defects is long resulting in various problems like mismatching the cost estimations in the upcoming development modules. Whereas, an automatic prediction technique based on the pre-generated software defect matrix can be deployed to correctly or nearly correct predictions to help in estimating the defects may raise in the upcoming modules. Hence in this work we try to investigate and understand the data mining techniques for defect prediction in software development. This work also results in modification notes to the existing processes by deploying a unique pre-processing technique for the defect matrix data using cumulative and normalized distribution of the initial data. The work will demonstrate the improvements in the existing works with the proposed pre-processing techniques.

# Abstract:-  

Smart grid is the key technology for an effective utilization of the Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The utilization of RES for the generation of electricity is increasingly gaining interest of researchers during the last decades. The main reason behind this is global incentivization, the increasing price of petroleum products, climate issues and deregulations in the energy market. As the Government of India, (MNRE i.e. Ministry of New & Renewable Energy) is targeting to generate 20000 MW power through grid-connected solar PVS by the year 2022 therefore, the main focus in this paper has been presented on power generation through grid-connected PVS. The emerging smart grid technology has enabled the grid-connected PVS as an evolving process in today‚Äôs world for electrical power generation. However, apart from so many advantages, there are several issues and challenges associated with the integration of PVS to the electric utility grid hence, the investigation to find out available possible solutions to overcome these issues becomes essential in order to enhance the performance of grid-connected PVS. The most severe constraint associated with this emerging technology is it high penetration level. If during low load conditions there is some mismatch found between the real power output and the load profile characteristics of PVS then it may results into large reverse power flow, high power losses or severe voltage violation. In this paper, several issues and challenges associated with the integration of solar PVS with the electric utility grid are presented. A discussion and conclusion based on the literature review has also been presented at the end of this article.

# Abstract:-  

Any sensor that senses a physical parameter produces an output electrical parameter. To convert this response of the sensor to a measurable level it must be amplified.  It is a desirable property to have a linear relation between the input and the amplified response of the sensor. This paper discusses with mathematical modeling of nonlinear response and its application to thermistor, pressure/humidity sensors. Amplification is performed using Op-amp circuits. Analog signal is then converted into digital signal by successive approximation register converter having resolution of 8bit.The read circuitry for linearization of the amplified signal from a thermistor is designed and simulated using multisim. A prototype unit can be built to monitor the weather condition at a place without the use of microcontrollers and can be displayed.

# Abstract:-  

This paper presents a retrofit design of a mechanism which helps in achieving the safety and stability of the two wheeler vehicle. The aim of the mechanism is to avoid the two wheeler from fall/skid and also work as an attachment for physically challenged drivers. The mechanism is a hydraulic system clubbed with linkages, where an extra two small sized wheels will be grounded to provide safety  from fall  and give stability to the two wheeler. The proposed retrofit mechanism would replace the double stand of the vehicle. These extra wheels will move along with the vehicle, hence provide the required stability. This will be a replacement of the costly attachments which the physically challenged driver adds to their vehicle. The shock absorbers would be included accordingly in the mechanism. The probable improvements on deploying the said mechanism on a two wheeler will provide easy riding, as the vehicle self-stabilize itself when the small wheels are grounded. This will help the less abled riders to easily ride the vehicle with no worries of grounding their feet. This idea developed by the authors is a result of conceptualization and brainstorming. A number of designs were developed, studied and three designs were shortlisted based on the feasibility of the mechanism. Finally, a better design is proposed for further implementation.

# Abstract:-  

The pipeline transportation of slurry is one of the sustainable modes of transportation. Particulate flow through pipeline gaining popularity because of eco-friendly nature and less maintenance charges. For long distance slurry transportation, it requires large capacity pumps and encountered with huge pressure loss along pipeline. Slurry transportation with higher solid mass concentration also leads to sedimentation of particles. Higher concentration BA slurry have settling characteristics which results in high pressure loss and also the sedimentation bed needs more power for flow in pipeline. This loss can be minimised by improving the rheological properties of slurry flowing through pipelines. Rheological behaviour of the slurry is highly influenced by chemical additives and hence flow behaviour of slurry in pipelines can be changed. The focus of this research is to experimentally examine the effect of chemical additives and higher shear rate over the rheological behaviour of fine particle bottom ash slurries. Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) and Sodium Salicylate (NaSal) are used as chemical additives in slurry samples. Experimental results show that the rheological properties of BA slurry are very much affected by chemical additives, shear rate and particle size range of BA. Combined effect of shear rates and dosages of chemical additives were investigated and gives encouraging results.

# Abstract:-  

The prospect of Leftover Deep-fried Oil based fuel production is very eye-catching for energy conversion. However, biodiesel is vulnerable to oxidative degradation due to autoxidation in the existence of oxygen, which hampers its extensive usage. Addition of antioxidant is a probable answer to achieve clean burning and improved combustion characteristic of biodiesel. An objective of the research paper is to experimentally study the influence of antioxidant accumulation to WFO biodiesel on diesel engine performance. WFOME was produced through transesterification process. Two monophenolic antioxidants, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHA) and 2(3)-tertbutyl-4-methoxy phenol (BHT), were added at 950 ppm absorption to B40 ( $40\%$ WFOME and $60\%$ diesel) for this investigation. Increased oxidation stability of B40 was noticed with addition of antioxidants without causing any significant negative effect on properties of WFOME. A 3.8 kW (5 HP) diesel engine was selected for this experimentation. The outcomes illustrate that antioxidant-treated B40 produced $2.15\%$ to $4.78\%$ higher brake thermal efficiency and BSFC by $2.08\%$ to $4.74\%$ compared to untreated B40. BHA and BHT generating an average decrease in oxides of nitrogen emission of 4 ppm to 8 ppm in comparison to B40.  However, compared to B40, mean increases in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions of $8.54~{-}17.08\%$ and 7.73‚Äì $14.95\%$ , respectively, were observed.

# Abstract:-  

The Piston pin which connects the piston to the connecting rod in a conventional internal combustion engine, is subjected to a combination of shearing and bending loads, and also Piston pin is expanded due to high temperatures produced in piston cylinder. Due to this, movement between the piston and connecting rod is constrained. The main objective of work is to focus on modelling and analysis of Piston pin by varying material and geometry. Many works are carried out by using alloys in the analysis of Piston pin such as aluminium, forged steels and titanium. The thermal expansion of the Piston pin is reduced by using a material Inconel 718 in form of layers. The solid model of Piston pin is created in CATIA V5. Thermal analysis is carried out for the Piston pin and thermal expansion is calculated. Parameters are compared for both the existing material and Inconel-718 material. The simulation results are validated with the theoretical results. From the results, the thermal expansion is lesser in Inconel-718 material than the $20\mathrm{Cr}$ alloy steel and also which is within the allowable limit. Hence Inconel-718 material is selected as the most suitable material for Gudgeon pin.

# Abstract:-  

For 2-D simulation of curvilinear flow field, use of momentum equations involves flow dispersion stress terms. Dispersion Stress terms take into account the effect of secondary flow variation arisen due to integration of the product of discrepancy between depth averaged velocity and the true velocity distributions. The objective of this paper is to present empirical mathematical functions to evaluate these terms. These terms can be incorporated in the 2D depth averaged flow equations as an additional source/sink term. In this work, the derivation is done to get revised set of empirical relations are later used in development of enhanced 2D numerical model in part-B of this paper. When compared with earlier investigations, the proposed formulations are simplified and numerically compatible. It is expected that modified formulation for flow dispersion stress tensor will lead to more realistic and improved simulation of flow field in curved flow domain.

# Abstract:-  

Handwriting recognition is a hotly debated topic which not many systems can run and execute. Handwriting recognition is used for bank check recognition, postal address interpretation, etc. Handwritten word/script recognition is one of the interesting fields based on the image processing and pattern recognition application. Every state Government has to follow the tri-scripts principle of the Indian Constitution, containing a national script (Devanagari), official script (Roman), and a regional state script. Indic devaganari scripts are the least recognizable scripts which very few systems are capable of doing. This paper gives a detailed procedural overview on various tools and techniques used for the recognition of Indic Devanagari scripts so far and achieved attainable accuracy. However, this study will help the researchers to understand, what acknowledgeable work has been done so far in the field of word recognition and what kind of problems are to face to develop a concrete solution for the word recognition problem for both handwritten as well as printed Devanagari scripts.

# Abstract:-  

This paper reports the effect of substrate on the optical gain characteristics of InGaAsN material based quantum well (QW) heterostructure. In order to study the substrate effect on the optical gain, two substrate, namely, GaAs and InP have been chosen. Taking in to account both of the substrates, the quantum mechanical approach (k.p method) has been adopted to calculate the confinement of the carriers associated with quantum well and the optical gain. In addition, for InGaAsN/InP heterostructure, the cladding effect has also been observed. The simulated results exhibit that the substrate has played a very important role in modifying the optical gain characteristics due to the existence of strain which comes into play due to the lattice mismatch.

# Abstract:-  

Purpose:- This paper presents the recent progress in this field of core-shell composites based on $Z_{\mathrm{{nO}}}$ nanostructures for optoelectronics devices application.  

Design/Methodology/approach:- Bottom-up and top-down approach have been used for $Z_{\mathrm{{nO}}}$ thin film synthesis. In the recent years, many deposition techniques are being used to synthesize ZnO thin film such as RF Sputtering, E-beam evaporation technique, RF thermal plasma, Sol-gel Process etc. RF Sputtering is the mostly used for growing thin film structures of $Z_{\mathrm{{nO}}}$ for device application. The $Z_{\mathrm{{nO}}}$ thin films are characterized for structural and optical properties with X-ray diffraction [XRD], field emission scanning electron microscopy [FESEM], scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and $\mathrm{\DeltaX}$ -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  

Findings:‚Äì Recently the Zinc oxide $(Z\mathrm{nO})$ nanoparticles attracted the researchers, because of its high excitation binding energy $(60\mathrm{meV})$ at room temperature and large bandwidth. $Z_{\mathrm{{nO}}}$ has the wide band gap energy of $3.37\ \mathrm{eV}$ with the high conductivity and it is low cost, environmentally friendly, easy to synthesize, non-toxic and transparent to visible spectrum range, which makes it a popular material for electronics, photonics, optoelectronics, acoustics and sensing applications. The study introduces that the optical and luminescence properties of $Z_{\mathrm{{nO}}}$ mainly depend on the selection of the impurity for doping, the parameters of the synthesis and relative treatment of the sample.

# Abstract:-  

Doping of magnetic ion (Transition metal) in oxide based semiconducting material at nanoscale level serves a variety of spintronics based applications. To understand the effect of dopants on the magnetic behavior of semiconducting oxides, we have synthesized Fe doped tin oxide nanoparticles with 1 and $2\%$ doping concentration via chemical co-precipitation method and then magnetic measurements have been taken through Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) at 5K and 300K temperatures for both the samples. Various magnetic parameters such as saturation magnetization $\mathrm{{(M_{s})}}$ , coercivity $\mathrm{(H_{c})}$ , remanent magnetization $(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{r}})$ have been extracted from the obtained hysteresis loops and found reduction in their values with increasing doping concentration which might corresponds to the tuning of oxygen defects created due to the substitution of dopant ions in the host lattice. In this way, our study can contributes to fulfill the necessity of ferromagnetism based applications such as data storage devices, gas sensors, communication, quantum computation etc.

# Abstract:-  

An electronic transport study about band structure effects of silicon nanowire field effect transistors (Si-NW FETs )in [100] and [110] transport orientations has been done. A dispersion calculation has also been done for a $\mathrm{sp}^{3}\mathrm{d}^{5}\mathrm{s}^{\ast}$ \*hybridized tight binding model coupled to a Poisson solver. For the evaluation of I-V characteristics, a ballistic model has been used. For [100] and [110] transport oriented nanowires, the total gate capacitance is decreased by $30\%$ . The carrier velocity is affected by both [100] and [110] transport oriented nanowires. The velocities depend on degeneracy and effective mass of the dispersion. In our study, we have used 3nm thick nanowire oriented in [100] and [110] directions. The [100] oriented nanowire gives better ON- current performance as compared to [110] oriented nanowire. We have studied the valley splitting effects which can lift the degeneracies of 3nm wires. The effective mass which changes with various transport orientations and quantization, is increased with quantization for [100] while it is decreased for[110] transport orientated nanowire.

# Abstract:-  

In this paper, we propose a quad-band metamaterial electromagnetic wave absorber structure consist of square rings resonators arranged in two dimensional periodic arrays with a metallic ground plane. Under normal incidence this structure manifests four sharp peak absorptions at 3.75, 5.05, 7.35 and $8.96\mathrm{GHz}$ with peak absorptivity of 94.28, 99.67, 99.98 and $99.90\%$ respectively. This structure with four-fold rotational symmetry in design provides nearly $100\%$ absorption for all angle of polarization. Moreover, This Structure is polarization insensitive and shows high absorption (over $90\%$ ) for oblique incident angles up to $45^{\circ}$ . Corresponding to the highest frequency the absorber is ultra-thin and uses commercially available FR-4 as substrate. The designed quad-band absorber can be used in many possible applications such as thermal emitters, sensors, receivers, shielding, spectroscopic detection, hazardous materials phase imaging and prohibited drugs and many defense applications etc. It can be easily manufactured with simple PCB manufacturing techniques.

# Abstract:-  

The flash point of a volatile liquid is the lowest temperature at which it can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air. Measuring a liquid's flash point requires an ignition source. At the flash point, the vapor may cease to burn when the source of ignition is removed. The flash point is not to be confused with the auto ignition temperature, which does not require an ignition source. The fire point, a higher temperature, is defined as the temperature at which the vapor continues to burn after being ignited. Neither the flash point nor the fire point is related to the temperature of the ignition source or of the burning liquid, which are much higher.  

The flash point is often used as a descriptive characteristic of liquid fuel, and it is also used to help characterize the fire hazards of liquids. ‚ÄúFlash point‚Äù refers to both flammable liquids and combustible liquids. There are various standards for defining each term. Flash and fire point is one of the important criteria for determining the process safety while handling the rubber compound during mixing, calendaring, extrusion etc. Higher flash and fire point of oils always indicates good process safety. High flash and fire point of oils may be due to presence of carbonyl groups, alkaloids groups. In this work, general study will be carrying out with One Regular oil and Two eco-processing oils (low poly cyclic aromatic). The effect of these processing oils in Solution SBR base compounds will be also studied like. To study Physico-chemical Analysis of Oils will be according to ASTM or ISO.

compound during mixing, calendaring, extrusion etc. Higher flash and fire point of oils always indicates good process safety. High flash and fire point of oils may be due to the presence of carbonyl groups, alkaloids groups etc. Such groups are absent in the case of oils No2, where major groups are long chain alkyl type.  

It can be concluded that LPCA oils can be used in a natural rubber, sSBR compound at the level of 2 to 5 phr (per hundred gram of rubber) with adjustment in cure package. LPCA oils can be alternative of HPCA oil, any effort of using the same will give rise to benefit of cost as well as environment protection.

# Abstract:-  

At present, provoking energy and environmental issues, such as the depletion of fossil fuels, pollution and global warming are ringing alarm bells to human society. Therefore, renewable energy storage and conversion materials, as well as their devices, are highly required [1]. In this context, these problems can be overcome in two ways. Firstly, energy can be effectively converted from its infinite sources, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), solar power and water to applicable forms, such as electricity or fuel. To achieve this goal, fuel cells, solar cells and water splitting catalysts are of most concern [2‚Äì3]. Secondly, environmental benignity, low cost, and high performance are required by energy storage devices.  Due to large surface area, good thermal and chemical stability, high conductivity and mechanical flexibility, graphene-based materials have been widely employed as energy storage devices. In this article, we mainly discuss the synthesis and unique electrochemical properties of graphene and its application towards lithium based different types of batteries, super capacitors and ORR for fuel cells.

# Active Noise Control Technique  

B.P. Mishra  

JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida bpmishra@jssaten.ac.in  

# Abstract:-  

In the current paper, an attempt was made to explore the active noise control technique to reduce the volume of an unwanted noise propagating through the environment using an electro-acoustic system using measurement sensors such as microphones and output actuators such as loudspeakers.  Since the noise signal usually comes from ambient, so that it is possible to measure the noise near its source. The goal of the active noise control system is to produce an ‚Äúanti-noise" that attenuates the unwanted noise in a desired quiet region using an adaptive filter. After implementation, the simulation results were obtained   in MATLAB. This problem differs from traditional adaptive noise cancellation in two ways. Firstly, the desired response signal cannot be directly measured; only the attenuated signal is available. Secondly, the active noise control system must take into account the secondary loudspeaker-to-microphone error path in its adaptation.
