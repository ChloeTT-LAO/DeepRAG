The novelty in power coefficient has design to harness the maximum power. Firstly, the model of Doubly fed Induction generator is developed incorporate wind turbine as mechanical input and then vector controlled method is used.

This paper presents a study   of the behavior of monopolar HVDC system in the presence of a single doubletuned dc filter. CIGRE Benchmark model for monopolar HVDC system has been simulated on PSCAD/EMTDC for the study. Five different fault locations, viz. three dc line faults (two faults near the line ends and the third fault at the middle point of the line) and two ac side faults (one near the rectifier and the other near the inverter), and five different values of fault resistance (ranging from 0 to 2000 ohms) have been considered. It has been observed that incremental current and incremental power in the HVDC line can discriminate only mid-line dc faults from ac fault. Also, incremental current can discriminate between rectifier-side ac fault and inverter-side ac fault for all values of fault resistance, whereas incremental power can do so only for lower values of fault resistance (0 ohm and 10 ohms). Transient energy can discriminate dc line faults at all locations from ac faults with all values of fault resistance. However, transient energy can discriminate rectifier-side ac fault from inverter-side ac fault only for low values of fault resistance (0 ohm and 10 ohms) and not for high values. This study can be very effectively used in developing a protection algorithm/algorithm. The study can be further extended to analyze the performance of HVDC system in the presence of any type of the dc filter and for any length of the line. ",

An objective function is a mathematical expression which describe the existing condition of a system with numerous variables, in which alteration of these variables result in optimized value largest or smallest, depending on the problem or desired value. That value may be obtained by minimizing or maximizing the objective function. In this paper, a review has been carried out on objective functions of distribution network expansion planning (DNEP). Besides most prominent objective, i.e. investment or expansion cost minimization, a numerous other objective functions are also listed and elaborated in the paper. These objective functions have been classified into five main categories: financial, income related, technical, optimal size & location and social & economic objectives. The selection of objective function clearly shows increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG), distributed energy storing systems (DESS) and fuel cells with renewable technologies. Most of the reviewed articles regarding DNEP highlight these objectives in details, however; not all fields have been covered in any single work on DNEP. This review article aims to address this gap so that widespread DNEP can be achieved with flawlessness. Most of the objective functions are in practice today while others are still under exhaustive investigation. This survey article recommends utilizing these classifications to obtain impeccable DNEP. Substantial information has been offered of research work done in the field of DNEP through this review article which will mitigate the impending researchers from the difficulties of getting apposite supervision.

The main goal of this study is to investigate the effect of the hydrophilic polymers on the poorly water soluble drug to enhance its solubility through the technique of hot-melt extrusion.   \nMethodology – The poorly aqueous soluble drug selected for this study was Norfloxacin and the hydrophilic polymers selected for this study were Polyox WSR 301, HPMC E5, Carbopol 980 and PEG 6000. Based on the literature and preliminary trials, the drug and the polymer were mixed at a ratio of 1:2 respectively and the mixture was processed through OMICRON 10 P (STEER Engineering Pvt. Ltd. Bengaluru) twin screw extruder.   \nFindings – The obtained solid dispersions were subjected to the saturation solubility study for 48 hours. All these polymers have enhanced the solubility of Norfloxacin when compared to the pure drug. Among these mixtures, Norfloxacin-Polyox WSR 301 combination has shown highest solubility followed by PEG 6000 and Carbopol 980.   \nResearch limitations – The technique may not be a cost-effective when compared to the other laboratory methods to prepare solid dispersions.   \nPractical implications – Hot melt extrusion technology is a significant industrial approach for the solubility enhancement of poorly aqueous soluble drugs as it is a continuous method to generate these solid dispersions.

Moreover, biofuels being environmentally safe, has an enormous potential to replace conventional petro-fuels. Biobutanol is one of the interesting biofuels that offers many advantages over bioethanol like higher calorific value, low vapor pressure, and good affinity with gasoline in varied ratio. However, conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process observed major challenges viz. low butanol concentration, yield, productivity, and solvent intolerance resulting in a high overall production cost, thus impeding its commercialization. To alleviate these concerns, effect of stimulator namely folic acid was investigated in present study to enhance butanol titer. Initially, different concentrations were screened and $10~\\mathrm{\\mg/L}$ folic acid supplementation showed highest butanol production of $10.78~\\mathrm{g/L}$ with total solvents to be 18.91 $\\mathrm{\\bfg/L}$ . Folic acid addition was also optimized to get surplus improvement in final product concentration.

Therefore, the designed antenna should be such that, even if the antenna is bent frequently, it should operate properly. In this paper, a conformal UWB antenna is reported which has been optimized to be conformal to any body shape and size. The proposed antenna has been designed on RT Duroid substrate with dielectric constant of 2.2 and loss tangent 0.0009. The thickness of the material is $0.127~\\mathrm{mm}$ . Due to low thickness; it can easily be bent and mounted on curved surfaces. The size of the antenna is $35\\times31~\\mathrm{mm}2$ .  To accomplish the design process, two different bending radii have been considered to bend the proposed antenna. The two bending radii of $25\\mathrm{mm}$ and $50~\\mathrm{mm}$ have been chosen; one corresponding to the arm of a healthy child of around 5 years age and another corresponding to a healthy person of age about 35 years with medium built. The simulated radiation efficiency and total antenna efficiency are more than $60\\%$ for the bending at $25\\mathrm{mm}$ and $50\\mathrm{mm}$ radii in the UWB frequency range from $3.1\\mathrm{GHz}$ to $10.6\\mathrm{GHz}$ . The gain of the proposed antenna for both the bending radii is changing from $1.4\\:\\mathrm{dB}$ to 5.3 dB. The return loss of the proposed antenna is obtained for $25\\mathrm{mm}$ and $50\\mathrm{mm}$ bending radii of curvatures and it is below $10~\\mathrm{dB}$ in UWB range. A prototype of proposed antenna has been fabricated and tested on Rohde & Schwarz 40 GHz VNA. Measured results are in close agreement with simulation results. ",

However, with increasing demands for performance improvement, growing competition, and imminent government regulations, carbon black is unable to fulfil the stringent requirements. Besides, as a filler, carbon black has limitations in terms of performance enhancements, and a large filler content is often prescribed. To this end, this study has focussed on development of Thermally Exfoliated Graphene Oxide (TEGO) reinforced engineered natural rubber (NR)/poly butadiene rubber (PBR) blend nanocomposites. Ultrasonication assisted latex mixing process was used to incorporate the nanofillers. Further, high speed mechanical perturbation and probe sonication were employed to ensure efficient dispersion of TEGO nanofillers, followed by co-coagulation of the nanofiller dispersed latex blends.  A systematic variation of TEGO content was carried out to investigate the effect of incorporation of the nanoparticles within the elastomeric matrix blends. The microstructure and static mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were then evaluated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies indicated possible chemical interactions between the functional groups present in the blended elastomers and TEGO. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed microstructural details of the nanocomposites which in turn could be attributed to superior mechanical behaviour of the developed elastomeric nanocomposites.

The process involves development and testing in iteration to detect the defects in the software. However, the process of detection and resolving the defects is long resulting in various problems like mismatching the cost estimations in the upcoming development modules. Whereas, an automatic prediction technique based on the pre-generated software defect matrix can be deployed to correctly or nearly correct predictions to help in estimating the defects may raise in the upcoming modules. Hence in this work we try to investigate and understand the data mining techniques for defect prediction in software development.

The utilization of RES for the generation of electricity is increasingly gaining interest of researchers during the last decades. The main reason behind this is global incentivization, the increasing price of petroleum products, climate issues and deregulations in the energy market. As the Government of India, (MNRE i.e. Ministry of New & Renewable Energy) is targeting to generate 20000 MW power through grid-connected solar PVS by the year 2022 therefore, the main focus in this paper has been presented on power generation through grid-connected PVS. The emerging smart grid technology has enabled the grid-connected PVS as an evolving process in today’s world for electrical power generation. However, apart from so many advantages, there are several issues and challenges associated with the integration of PVS to the electric utility grid hence, the investigation to find out available possible solutions to overcome these issues becomes essential in order to enhance the performance of grid-connected PVS. The most severe constraint associated with this emerging technology is it high penetration level. If during low load conditions there is some mismatch found between the real power output and the load profile characteristics of PVS then it may results into large reverse power flow, high power losses or severe voltage violation. In this paper, several issues and challenges associated with the integration of solar PVS with the electric utility grid are presented. A discussion and conclusion based on the literature review has also been presented at the end of this article. ",

The hybrid human powered power generating unit is an electronic device, purpose of proposed model is to supply electricity for charging devices when the user is out of reach to the charger or charging port. This device basically transforms many different kind of energies to electricity (direct current) example piezoelectric plate produces electrical energy when mechanical force is applied on it and another we have Peltier plate (thermal electric generator) which transforms temperature differences into electrical energy.  The proposed model is very much portable, so any individual easily can carry with them. This device does not need any external power supply to charge it, because this device made up of four energy inducing elements or can say transducers and one buck booster which step up the output voltage of the energy produced or induced by the generating elements assembled with a super-capacitor. This device is very useful in the situation where the person doesn’t have power source around and need to charge any electronic device. This device can replace your heavy power bank with this light weighted device. Anyone can easily use this electronic device simply by squeezing it and shaking horizontally, these all physical movements induces electrical energy and got stored in super capacitor and further consume by the charging devices.

This paper discusses with mathematical modeling of nonlinear response and its application to thermistor, pressure/humidity sensors. Amplification is performed using Op-amp circuits. Analog signal is then converted into digital signal by successive approximation register converter having resolution of 8bit.The read circuitry for linearization of the amplified signal from a thermistor is designed and simulated using multisim. A prototype unit can be built to monitor the weather condition at a place without the use of microcontrollers and can be displayed. ",

        "text": "This paper presents a retrofit design of a mechanism which helps in achieving the safety and stability of the two wheeler vehicle. The aim of the mechanism is to avoid the two wheeler from fall/skid and also work as an attachment for physically challenged drivers. The mechanism is a hydraulic system clubbed with linkages, where an extra two small sized wheels will be grounded to provide safety  from fall  and give stability to the two wheeler. The proposed retrofit mechanism would replace the double stand of the vehicle. These extra wheels will move along with the vehicle, hence provide the required stability. This will be a replacement of the costly attachments which the physically challenged driver adds to their vehicle. The shock absorbers would be included accordingly in the mechanism. The probable improvements on deploying the said mechanism on a two wheeler will provide easy riding, as the vehicle self-stabilize itself when the small wheels are grounded. This will help the less abled riders to easily ride the vehicle with no worries of grounding their feet. This idea developed by the authors is a result of conceptualization and brainstorming. A number of designs were developed, studied and three designs were shortlisted based on the feasibility of the mechanism. Finally, a better design is proposed for further implementation. ",

        "text": "The pipeline transportation of slurry is one of the sustainable modes of transportation. Particulate flow through pipeline gaining popularity because of eco-friendly nature and less maintenance charges. For long distance slurry transportation, it requires large capacity pumps and encountered with huge pressure loss along pipeline. Slurry transportation with higher solid mass concentration also leads to sedimentation of particles. Higher concentration BA slurry have settling characteristics which results in high pressure loss and also the sedimentation bed needs more power for flow in pipeline. This loss can be minimised by improving the rheological properties of slurry flowing through pipelines. Rheological behaviour of the slurry is highly influenced by chemical additives and hence flow behaviour of slurry in pipelines can be changed. The focus of this research is to experimentally examine the effect of chemical additives and higher shear rate over the rheological behaviour of fine particle bottom ash slurries. Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) and Sodium Salicylate (NaSal) are used as chemical additives in slurry samples. Experimental results show that the rheological properties of BA slurry are very much affected by chemical additives, shear rate and particle size range of BA. Combined effect of shear rates and dosages of chemical additives were investigated and gives encouraging results. ",

However, biodiesel is vulnerable to oxidative degradation due to autoxidation in the existence of oxygen, which hampers its extensive usage. Addition of antioxidant is a probable answer to achieve clean burning and improved combustion characteristic of biodiesel. An objective of the research paper is to experimentally study the influence of antioxidant accumulation to WFO biodiesel on diesel engine performance. WFOME was produced through transesterification process. Two monophenolic antioxidants, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHA) and 2(3)-tertbutyl-4-methoxy phenol (BHT), were added at 950 ppm absorption to B40 ( $40\\%$ WFOME and $60\\%$ diesel) for this investigation. Increased oxidation stability of B40 was noticed with addition of antioxidants without causing any significant negative effect on properties of WFOME. A 3.8 kW (5 HP) diesel engine was selected for this experimentation. The outcomes illustrate that antioxidant-treated B40 produced $2.15\\%$ to $4.78\\%$ higher brake thermal efficiency and BSFC by $2.08\\%$ to $4.74\\%$ compared to untreated B40. BHA and BHT generating an average decrease in oxides of nitrogen emission of 4 ppm to 8 ppm in comparison to B40.  However, compared to B40, mean increases in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions of $8.54~{-}17.08\\%$ and 7.73– $14.95\\%$ , respectively, were observed. ",

Many works are carried out by using alloys in the analysis of Piston pin such as aluminium, forged steels and titanium. The thermal expansion of the Piston pin is reduced by using a material Inconel 718 in form of layers. The solid model of Piston pin is created in CATIA V5. Thermal analysis is carried out for the Piston pin and thermal expansion is calculated. Parameters are compared for both the existing material and Inconel-718 material. The simulation results are validated with the theoretical results. From the results, the thermal expansion is lesser in Inconel-718 material than the $20\\mathrm{Cr}$ alloy steel and also which is within the allowable limit. Hence Inconel-718 material is selected as the most suitable material for Gudgeon pin. ",

The recent trends in technology are increasingly in the realm of intelligent system due to its ability to learn from experience, handling uncertainty, reasoning, providing security and ability to adapt according to current  data.  To improve robustness and visual quality of watermarked image, this paper presents the hybrid approach of intelligent system(DFIP) and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) using digital watermarking system in frequency and spatial domain.

Firstly, energy can be effectively converted from its infinite sources, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), solar power and water to applicable forms, such as electricity or fuel. To achieve this goal, fuel cells, solar cells and water splitting catalysts are of most concern [2–3]. Secondly, environmental benignity, low cost, and high performance are required by energy storage devices.  Due to large surface area, good thermal and chemical stability, high conductivity and mechanical flexibility, graphene-based materials have been widely employed as energy storage devices.

        "text": "In the current paper, an attempt was made to explore the active noise control technique to reduce the volume of an unwanted noise propagating through the environment using an electro-acoustic system using measurement sensors such as microphones and output actuators such as loudspeakers.  Since the noise signal usually comes from ambient, so that it is possible to measure the noise near its source. The goal of the active noise control system is to produce an “anti-noise\" that attenuates the unwanted noise in a desired quiet region using an adaptive filter. After implementation, the simulation results were obtained   in MATLAB. This problem differs from traditional adaptive noise cancellation in two ways. Firstly, the desired response signal cannot be directly measured; only the attenuated signal is available. Secondly, the active noise control system must take into account the secondary loudspeaker-to-microphone error path in its adaptation. ",
