As such, public funds of  ₩9,000 billion provided by the Korean government through Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation were injected into the Company as preferred stock during the period from June 1999 to July 2001 for the Company’s business normalization. Thereafter, the Company’s consistent efforts for the business normalization resulted in the termination of the insolvent status in December 2004 in accordance with the decision of the Financial Supervisory Committee in December 2004. In order to repay such public funds earlier than the predetermined payment schedule, the Company executed a reverse stock split of 9.18 shares to 1 share of its common shares and preferred shares, and paid out ₩550 billion in cash to its shareholders in accordance with a resolution of the Company’s extraordinary stockholders’ meeting held on January 18, 2006. In addition, in accordance with a resolution of the Company’s board of directors held on December 21, 2006, the Company transferred  ₩229.2 billion of gain on capital reduction to capital stock accounts.
