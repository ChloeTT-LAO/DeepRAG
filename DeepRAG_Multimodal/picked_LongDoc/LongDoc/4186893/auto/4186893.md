# For Seoul Guarantee Insurance, 2008 was another outstanding year to be highlighted in the 40 years of history.  

# Dear our clients,  

This is Young-Min Baang, the President & CEO of Seoul Guarantee Insurance (SGI).  

First of all, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your continuous support and kind attention to SGI over the past 40 years.  

Since 1969, when SGI was established, SGI has played a major role to assist with a high degree of achievement in development of Korean economy by offering guarantees to the corporates and individuals in need of credit.  

Especially, last year, SGI has attained a number of admirable operating results with consistent and cooperative efforts from both management and the employees despite the global economic recession.  

First, SGI realized a net income of USD 183 million, and a written premium of USD 731 million which is the most pleasing result since the company’s establishment in 1969. It is very meaningful in that this result has been realized despite the global financial crisis in last year and some banks required public funds and some financial institutions resulted in deficit. In this prevailing economic recession, SGI had already been ready to cope with this credit crunch by its Contingency Plan in advance with a strengthened risk management.  

Second, the progress and expansion of overseas business have accelerated since 2007 with opening representative office in Hanoi Vietnam in October 2007, followed by another office in Beijing China in June, 2008. Furthermore, by having business agreements with the local banks in U.A.E. and Kuwait, SGI has built the foundation to help Korean companies in abroad with service to provide guarantee exposure of USD 268 million. As a result, SGI has supported companies with overseas business, and expanded new driving forces in Korean economy.

Also, in order to strengthen our global network, SGI successfully hosted 67th ICISA General & Associated Meetings of 2009 and attended important international conferences such as the China Guaranty Forum, SFAA (Surety Fidelity Association of America), and PASA (Pan-American Surety Association). And this enabled to build up business relationship with surety & credit insurers and reinsurers for us to reach higher global standards.  

Third, SGI has consecutively obtained credit ratings A- from S&P and A from Fitch. SGI has maintained the top rating among the Korean guarantee institutions reflecting the SGI’s overall superior financial soundness. In addition, the Korea Information Service has assigned AAA, which is the highest rating in the Korea non-life insurance companies. With these credit ratings, SGI gained public trust in international business, and has built the foundation to develop and expand global business opportunities.  

# “ Our corporate vision is to become the world top-class financial institution, by providing diverse international services in a broadened network. ”  

Fourth, SGI was broadly acknowledged by receiving many prestigious awards. That is, 「The Excellent Service Quality Enterprise Award」 from the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, 「Da-San Finance Award, insurance section」 presented by The Korea Economic Daily, $^\Gamma_{\mathrm{MK}}$ Financial Products Awards」 from Maeil Business Newspaper Daily, and many others. These achievements convey the company’s sound performance and solid reputation in the Korean financial market.  

Fifth, SGI has successfully introduced the management accounting system to enhance cost-benefit analysis of every divisions of the company and distinguished the sources of profit and losses to apply the criteria of profitability. By performing profit evaluation on each branch and regional headquarter level, we have been able to prepare a rewarding system according to the profit contributions of each unit. Along with this, it was an innovation for us to have saved operating expenses of USD 13.6 million compared to the organized annual budget by introducing open competition system to contracts and by improving payment process for regular expenditures.  

Also, we have put our special efforts in building up mutual trust between the management and the employees. Reforming the personnel policies into a performance and ability based method, and training global professionals were also an important part we have progressively worked for.

All these fruitful achievements have been obtained with your attentive support, and with the devotions of all members of SGI. We would like to deliver our sincere gratitude again to all of you.  

# Dear our esteemed clients,  

The business environment of the year 2009 appears to be considerably challenging that it’ll become more difficult to predict the future.  

Accordingly, SGI will gather its capacities and take challenging steps to realize the vision of becoming the “World Top-Class Financial Institution.” To this end, in 2009 we’ll thoroughly pursue our management policies to prepare for the crisis, to strengthen core competence, and to correspond to the future market changes.  

We ask for your constant attention and cooperation. The people of Seoul Guarantee Insurance and myself will not let ourselves be self-satisfied with the recent years results, and will use our utmost efforts to fully attain our goals.

The history of Seoul Guarantee Insurance in the past 40 years is considered as a notable achievement in the evolution of the Korean economic development. SGI has been the consistent partner by being involved in the various types of business opportunities since the beginning of the Korea’s industrialization. Korea Fidelity & Surety Company (KFSC) was introduced in 1969 when industrial growth and production of infrastructure was the key economic issue. As the industry began to increase volume, more players entered into the market and meanwhile new legislations and customs were introduced including such statements that indicated the bonds or guarantees are necessary contracting conditions.  

2008   
Opened Representative   
Office in Beijing,   
China

As Korean economy rapidly grew during the 1980s, in addition to KFSC, Hankuk Fidelity & Surety Company (HFSC) was newly established in 1989 to respond to the high demands for bonds and guarantees. The two companies shared the function to provide guarantees and increased the market volume. After ten years of co-existence, The two merged into one company having undergone the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998, which had largely impacted on the firms in Korea. The new Seoul Guarantee Insurance, as the sole professional guarantee insurer, exerted to restore the company, and with a new business strategy and underwriting guideline, SGI changed into a competent guarantee institution to attain its aim to support clients and to assist in the development of economy.  

2009   
SGI’s 40th Anniversary   
Celebration  

![](images/1add1fc5c1befd21262493b482fa913f3a398c7ec6f883da0a7899ba5b16c8e4.jpg)  

SGI’s operation continuously grew, by reaching the total exposure of 500 billion won on 1995 and 1 trillion won on 2007. In average, SGI is providing bond and credit insurance capacity of over 100 trillion won in terms of newly issued policies per annum. By attaining an A and A- from Fitch and S&P respectively, along with an AAA from Korean Information Service which is the highest ratings among the domestic companies, SGI is recognized as a credible guarantee institution that is enabling more international business advances available. The company’s pursuit to expand overseas business has accelerated since 2007 with opening representative office in Hanoi Vietnam in October 2007, followed by another office in Beijing China in June 2008, which has resulted in a wider business network and a better understanding on the local market.  

2009 Host for 67th Associated General Meeting (ICISA)

Looking back on the past 40 years of history, the present times of global economic recession is an unfavourable condition compared to the previous ones we had overcome. Because SGI has experiences in the up and downturn in the past economic changes, the company was able to minimize negative impacts from the crisis in 2008 by effecting a preemptive counterplan to face the future contingencies. As a result SGI has instead accomplished the largest written premium in 2009 with over 1 trillion won and made a net income of 250 billion won. For the past 40 years, SGI have successfully functioned its role as the number one guarantee insurance company leading the market. With a sound financial management and underwriting expertise, SGI will move forward into the global market to become a “World Top-Class Financial Institution.”

SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law, and it has offices around the world with its headquarters located in Belgium.  

One of the main functions of SWIFT services include message transmission called “FIN.” SGI has applied for SWIFT to adopt FIN service in the company’s process for issuing guarantees. SWIFT transports financial messages in a highly secure way, and is used widely to transfer the certificate of guarantees. It will raise overall efficiency in company’s daily operations, and also will enhance business transactions with financial institutions worldwide. And further, it will improve the transparency and validity of the bonds which need to be issued to the foreign beneficiaries and banks. It is considered that SWIFT system will build a foundation to elevate international guarantee issuing standards to a higher level.

Concentrating on its core business of bonds, guarantees and credit insurance, SGI has written over 1 trillion Korean Won in the gross premium in FY2008. By issuing bonds and credit insurance policies for a wide variety of business transactions, Seoul Guarantee Insurance aims to create value to the clients and assist them in their economic activities.  

The primary insurance book of SGI includes mainly the surety bond and credit insurance and other products such as the fidelity bonds, where the surety bonds are mostly for the purpose of securing a contract and the credit insurance  protects a seller or merchandiser for its sold goods.

Premium Portfolio  

In 2008, SGI’s product mix consisted of $73\%$ of surety bonds, $22\%$ of credit insurance products and others by $5\%$ . The written premium was USD 731 million reflecting a $21\%$ increase from 2007 which accounts for the extended premium volume in credit insurance and in the contract bonds. In contrast, Financial Guarantees decreased $16\%$ from 2007 which was a composite result of a strengthened underwriting guideline to control loss for certain principals, and an influence coming from our large client that chose to reduce the bond amount according to their changed corporate policy.  

The increase in the contract bonds are influenced by the Korea government’s expenditure that concentrated earlier in the 1st quarter of 2009 and the increased public projects to boost the economy. As for the credit insurance increase in 2008, it was due to the telecommunication companies marketing strategy to make the buyers use the cell phones for a given contracted period. By contracting a certain period of use, the buyers can acquire a cell phone for a lower price. Therefore the demands for new cell phones increased. These effects along with the fact that the installment credit insurance policies are not easily cancelled due to the new contracting policy, the premium level of the installment credit insurance increased in 2008.

# Fronting Business  

An overseas Project Owner can request a contractor that a bond needs to be provided by a local insurer located in his area. But it is quite rare for those insurers to issue bonds, as it is difficult for them to assess the contractor’s credit standing and perform underwriting.  

In such cases, an insurer at the contractor’s country (“instructing company”) may request its counterparty (“fronting company”) based in the other country in question to issue a bond on behalf of itself, for the contractor to obtain a foreign bond easily and promptly. This cooperative activity is called “fronting.”  

After bond issuance, the fronting company cedes the risk to the instructing company that requested the bond issuance, which is called a “reinsurance.” Therefore, it is the instructing company that actually assumes the risk.

# 1. Corporate information  

Seoul Guarantee Insurance Company (the “Company”) was incorporated on February 19, 1969 under the laws of the Republic of Korea to engage in Renon-life insurance business and other related operations such as surety insurance, credit insurance, reinsurance and related asset management, etc. under the name of Korea Fidelity & Surety Co., Ltd. On November 25, 1998, the Company merged with Hankuk Fidelity & Surety Co., Ltd. as part of its business rationalization and changed its name to Seoul Guarantee Insurance Company.  

In April 1999, the Financial Supervisory Service (“FSS”) performed a valuation due diligence of the Company’s assets and liabilities. As a result, the Company was determined to be an insolvent insurance company. As such, public funds of  ₩9,000 billion provided by the Korean government through Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation were injected into the Company as preferred stock during the period from June 1999 to July 2001 for the Company’s business normalization. Thereafter, the Company’s consistent efforts for the business normalization resulted in the termination of the insolvent status in December 2004 in accordance with the decision of the Financial Supervisory Committee in December 2004. In order to repay such public funds earlier than the predetermined payment schedule, the Company executed a reverse stock split of 9.18 shares to 1 share of its common shares and preferred shares, and paid out ₩550 billion in cash to its shareholders in accordance with a resolution of the Company’s extraordinary stockholders’ meeting held on January 18, 2006. In addition, in accordance with a resolution of the Company’s board of directors held on December 21, 2006, the Company transferred  ₩229.2 billion of gain on capital reduction to capital stock accounts. As of March 31, 2009, the Company’s paid in capital for common stock and preferred stock amounted to ₩174,554 million and ₩1,179,520 million, respectively.

Adoption of new and revised Statements of Korea Accounting Standards (“SKAS”), Korea Financial Accounting Standards (“KFAS”), Korea Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation (“KFAS Interpretation”) and Korea Accounting Institute Opinion (“KAI Opinion”)  _  

The Company has adopted the following new and revised SKAS, KFAS and KAI Opinion for the current financial year.  

# Notes to financial statements  

March 31, 2009 and 2008  

SKAS 8 Amendments-InvestmentinSecurities   
SKAS 15Amendments-InvestmentinAsociates   
SKAS 16Amendments-IncomeTaxes   
SKAS 14Amendments-ExceptionstoAcountingforSmalandMedium-SizedEntities   
KFAS Article 70-2 - SpecialExemptiontoDerivativesAcounting   
Regulation on Supervision of Insurance Business Amendments  

Adoption of the above revised standards and opinion had no impact on the Company’s financial statements, except as follows:  

# SKAS 16Amendments-IncomeTaxes  

The revised standard requires an entity to apply the revised disclosures which enable users of the financial statements to better understand the components of income taxes reported in the financial statements. These revised disclosures are presented in Note 27.  

# Fiscal year _  

The Company’s fiscal year end is March 31. References in the accompanying financial statements to 2009 and 2008 represent the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

# Revenues  

Revenue from premium income is recognized at the time when such premium payments become due and are realized. In addition, premiums that are paid before the payment due date are accounted for as unearned insurance premiums. Interest income on deposits, securities and loans, and other investments is recognized as income in the period in which it is earned. Interest income on defaulted and delinquent loans and loans where payment schedule of principal or interest payments have been extended is recognized as income in the period in which payments are received.  

# Investments in securities _  

Investments in securities within the scope of SKAS 8 InvestmentsinSecuritiesare classified as either trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale securities, as appropriate, and are initially measured at cost, including incidental expenses, with cost being determined using the moving average method. The Company determines the classification of its investments after initial recognition, and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each fiscal year end.  

Securities that are acquired and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities. Debt securities which carry fixed or determinable principal payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-maturity if the Company has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Securities that are not classified as either trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale securities.  

After initial measurement, available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value with unrealized gains or losses being recognized directly in equity as other comprehensive income. Likewise, trading securities are also measured at fair value after initial measurement, but with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of net income. Held-to-maturity securities are measured at amortized cost after initial measurement. The cost is computed as the amount initially recognized minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest rate method of any difference between the initially recognized amount and the maturity amount.  

# Notes to financial statements  

March 31, 2009 and 2008  

The fair value of trading and available-for-sale securities that are traded actively in the open market (marketable securities) is measured at the closing price of those securities at the balance sheet date, except for non-marketable equity securities which are measured at cost subsequent to initial measurement if their fair values cannot be reliably estimated. Non-marketable debt securities are carried at a value using the present value of future cash flows discounted using an appropriate interest rate which reflects the issuer’s credit rating announced by a public independent credit rating agency. If the application of such measurement method is not feasible, estimates of fair values may be made using a reasonable valuation model or quoted market prices of similar debt securities issued by entities conducting business in similar industries.  

The Company recognizes an impairment loss on its investments in securities if there is objective evidence that the securities are impaired. The impairment loss is charged to statement of income.  

# Equity method investments _  

Investments in entities over which the Company has control or significant influence are accounted for using the equity method.  

Under the equity method of accounting, the Company’s initial investment in an investee is recorded at acquisition cost. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the Company’s share of income or loss of the investee in the statement of income and share of changes in equity that have been recognized directly in the equity of the investee in the related equity account of the Company on the balance sheet.  

# Allowance for doubtful accounts  

The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided in compliance with the Regulation on Insurance Supervision (“RIS”), which require the application of minimum loss ratios based on the degree of collectibility of all receivables including loans. Loans are classified as normal, special mention, substandard, doubtful and estimated loss, and the related allowance is calculated at a minimum of $0.5\%$ $10.75\%$ for household loans), $2\%$ $(5\%$ for household loans), $20\%$ , $50\%$ and $100\%$ , respectively, of the outstanding amount in each classification.  

# Property and equipment  

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.  

Maintenance and repairs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Expenditures that enhance the value or extend the useful life of the related assets are capitalized.  

Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the declining balance method except buildings and structures, which are depreciated using the straightline method, without retaining a residual value in its accounts, over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Years</td></tr><tr><td>Buildings 25 ~ 50 </td></tr><tr><td>Structures 15 ~50 </td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and equipment ５</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles 5</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Notes to financial statements  

March 31, 2009 and 2008  

Intangible assets _  

Intangible assets of the Company consist of software, development costs, and industrial rights, etc. and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized as an operating expense based on the declining balance method, except development costs which is amortized using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful life of five years.  

# Compensation receivable  

Of the amounts paid for claims during the year, amounts recoverable by exercising compensation and other rights or through disposal of secured assets acquired in the resolution of accidents are accounted for as compensation receivables included in other assets, which are calculated by considering the individual current status of compensation rights or using the statistical method. If the Company acquires the restricted securities or non-listed securities by exercising compensation rights, etc., those securities are stated at fair value at the time of acquisition and are accounted for as available-for-sale securities and advances received at the same time in the accompanying balance sheet. The amounts recoverable from those securities in the balance sheet date are credited (debited) to compensation income in the statement of income (compensation receivable in the balance sheet). In case of calculating compensation receivable by considering individual current status of those rights, those compensation receivable is offset against the advances received.  

# Foreign currency transactions and translation  

Transactions involving foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing at the time the transactions are made. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Korean won at the prevailing exchange rates of  ₩1,377.1 to US\$1 (₩1,816.4 to EUR€1) at March 31, 2009 and ₩991.7 to US\$1 (₩1,565.0 to EUR€1) at March 31, 2008. The resulting unrealized foreign currency translation gains (losses) are credited (charged) to current operations.  

# Policy reserves _  

In accordance with the Insurance Business Act (“IBA”) and the Regulation on Insurance Supervision (“RIS”), the Company is required to maintain policy reserves, which consist of, reserve for outstanding claims, unearned premium reserve, and reinsurance reserve as a liability at amounts determined in the manual for calculation of premium and policy reserves which was approved by the FSC and reviewed by an appointed actuary of the Company. Details are as follows:  

(1) Reserve for outstanding claims - Reserve for outstanding claims refers to a provision for claims fixed but not settled, for claims not fixed and therefore not yet settled on the insurance policies and not reported (IBNR) where the cause of payment of claims, etc. has been incurred at the balance sheet date. The amounts recoverable in future by exercising compensation and other rights or through disposal of secured assets acquired in the resolution of accidents are directly deducted from the reserve for outstanding claims when the Company provides such reserve.   
(2) Unearned premium reserve - The Company is required to maintain an unearned premium reserve, which is the premium whose payment date belongs to the current year and whose applicable period has not yet arrived at the balance sheet date.   
(3) Reinsurance reserve -  In the event of ceding insurance, the Company maintains reinsurance reserves at amounts which are expected to be collected and notified from the ceded reinsurance companies pursuant to relevant laws.  

# Catastrophe reserve  

In order to prepare for and recover from exceptionally large claims which may be incurred in the future, the Company is required to maintain a catastrophe reserve as a liability with reserve rates determined by the IBA and the RIS. The Company provides a catastrophe reserve by multiplying predetermined ratios to net retained premiums received during a fiscal year by line of insurance, up to certain limit, as calculated by multiplying predetermined ratios to the total insurance premiums received during a fiscal year by line of insurance in accordance with the RIS requirements.  

This reserve can be reversed up to the limit of the net loss for the year in the event that the ratio of net insurance expenses claimed to net earned insurance premiums at risk, by line of insurance, for the year is in excess of the ratio by line of insurance which are regulated by the RIS.  

March 31, 2009 and 2008  

# Severance and retirement benefits _  

In accordance with the Korean Law on Guarantee of Employees’ Severance and Retirement Benefits and the Company’s regulations, employees and directors terminating their employment with at least one year of service are entitled to severance and retirement benefits, based on the rates of pay in effect at the time of termination, years of service and certain other factors. The provision for the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 is sufficient to state the liability at the estimated obligation arising from services performed to and at rates of pay in effect as of March 31, 2009 and 2008. Funding of this liability is not required by Korean law.  

In accordance with the Korean National Pension Law prior to revision, the Company had prepaid a portion of its severance and retirement benefits obligation to the National Pension Service (“NPS”) at the rate of $3\%$ of payroll expense up through March 31, 1999. Such prepayments have been offset against the Company’s liability for severance and retirement benefits. In accordance with a revision in the Korean National Pension Law, additions to these prepayments are no longer required effective from April 1, 1999.  

# Restructuring of debts _  

A debt, whose contractual terms are modified in a debt restructuring due to mutual agreements such as commencement of reorganization, court composition and workout program, is recorded at present value of expected future cash flows, if the book value of the debt differs from the present value. The difference between book value and present value is credited to gain on exemption of the debts. At the same time, such difference is directly deducted from the debt and amortized over the remaining maturity using the effective interest rate method. The amortization amount is recorded in interest expense.  

# Income taxes  

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the tax authorities, respectively. Deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. In addition, current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited directly to equity if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.  

# Per share amounts  

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  

# Derivative financial instruments  

The Company records its rights or obligations arising from derivative contracts such as put options as derivative assets or liabilities, respectively, which are stated at fair value.  

# Significant judgment and accounting estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Korean GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Lawsuits against Samsung Motors Co., Ltd. - In September 1999, the Company and other creditors of Samsung Motors Co., Ltd. (“SMCL”) entered into an agreement (“Agreement I”) with the chairman of the Samsung group of companies, Mr. Kun-Hee Lee, and the Samsung group affiliates in connection with collection of SMCL’s debts.

According to the Agreement I, such common shares shall be sold by December 31, 2000 for collection of SMCL’s debts. However, if the total proceeds from the sale of common shares by the Company and other creditors do not exceed ₩2,450 billion (or ₩700,000 per share in units), Mr. Kun-Hee Lee and the Samsung group affiliates shall purchase subordinated debt or new common shares issued by the Company and the other creditors for any shortfall amount.

On December 9, 2005, the Company and the other creditors filed a lawsuit against Mr. Kun-Hee Lee and the Samsung group affiliates to pay the principal and interest amount. On January 31, 2008, the Company and the other creditors won the lawsuit from the Seoul District Court who authorized an effectiveness of Agreement I.

However, if the ultimate sales price of the securitized SLI common shares is below ₩816.5 billion, the Company shall pay the SPC the shortfall amount and at the same time the Company shall be reimbursed by Mr. Kun-Hee Lee and Samsung group companies.

# 19. Deposits for security  

The Company received time deposits and government bonds from its policyholders to secure the legally incurred compensation receivables from third parties arising from the fulfillment of its obligations on the insurance policies and accounted for those deposits and bonds in suspense accounts, which are not recorded in the accompanying financial statements. However, it is no longer allowed for the Company to receive those time deposits and bonds in accordance with a revision in the related law effective from January 1, 2007 and therefore the Company started to let its policyholders provide their own name registered time deposits for the Company as collateral starting from January 1, 2007.

Those deposits and bonds may be debited to current operations in the event that the insurance claims benefits would be paid to the beneficiaries, if any, in the future.  

Cash deposits which the Company had received from its policyholders under the same purpose up to 1997 have been accounted for as other liabilities and the related interest to be paid to the policyholders has been calculated by applying the annual interest rate which is disclosed on a monthly basis by Korea Insurance Development Institute and charged to current operations. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, the remaining cash deposits which the Company holds as an off-balance sheet item amounted to ₩974 million and ₩1,038 million, respectively.

# The Representative Director Seoul Guarantee Insurance Company  

We have reviewed the accompanying management’s report on the operations of the internal accounting control system (“ICFR”) of Seoul Guarantee Insurance Company (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2009. The Company’s management is responsible for the design and operations of its ICFR, including the reporting of its operations. Our responsibility is to review management’s ICFR report and issue a report based on our review. Management’s report on the operations of the ICFR of the Company states that “based on its assessment of the operations of the ICFR as of March 31, 2009, the Company’s ICFR has been effectively designed and has operated as of March 31, 2009, in all material respects, in accordance with the ICFR standards established by the ICFR Operations Committee.”  

We conducted our review in accordance with the ICFR review standards established by the Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants. These standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain less assurance than an audit as to management’s report on the operations of the ICFR. A review includes the procedures of obtaining an understanding of the ICFR, inquiring as to management’s report on the operations of the ICFR and performing a review of related documentation within limited scope, if necessary.  

A company’s ICFR consists of an establishment of related policies and organization to ensure that it is designed to provide reasonable assurance on the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external financial reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Republic of Korea. However, because of its inherent limitations, the ICFR may not prevent or detect material misstatements of the financial statements. Also, projections of any assessment of the ICFR on future periods are subject to the risk that ICFR may become inadequate due to the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may be significantly reduced.  

Based on our review of the management’s report on the operations of the ICFR, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the management’ s report referred to above is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the ICFR standards.  

We conducted our review of the ICFR in existence as of March 31, 2009, and we did not review the ICFR subsequent to March 31, 2009. This report has been prepared for Korean regulatory purposes pursuant to the Act on External Audit for Joint-Stock Companies, and may not be appropriate for other purposes or for other users.
