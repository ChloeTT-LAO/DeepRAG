AMENDMENT TO BYLAWS (Section 128)  

The Owners, Strata Plan VIs 4810 certify that the following or attached amendments to the bylaws of the strata corporation were approved by a resolution passed in accordance with section 128 of the Strata Property Act at an annual general meeting held on March 3, 2004.

# SPECIAL RESOLUTION #2 -VOTING  

WHEREAS the Strata Property Act of B.C. under section S3 (2) provides that a Strata Corporation may, by By-Law, provide that the vote for a Strata Lot may not be exercised if the Strata Corporation is entitled to register a Lien against that Strata Lot under section 116;  

BE IT RESOLVED THAT a vote for a Strata Lot may not be exercised, except on matters requiring a unanimous vote, if the Strata Corporation is entitled to register a Lien against that Strata Lot under section 116 of the Strata Property Act.  

# SPECIAL RESOLUTION #3 - ELIGIBILITY FOR COUNCIL  

WHEREAS the Strata Property Act of B.C. under section 28 (3) provides that a Strata Corporation may, by By-Law, provide that no person may stand for Council or continue to be on Council if the Strata Corporation is entitled to register a Lien against that Strata Lot;  

BE IT RESOLVED THAT no person may stand for Council or continue to be on Council with respect to a Strata Lot if the Strata Corporation is entitled to register a Lien against that Strata Lot under section 116 (1) of the Strata Property Act.  

# Discussion  

In response to the question how the \$100 per square foot figure was achieved, the Chair explained that it was a figure, which seemed fair between the amount having been offered by the purchaser and the estimated replacement construction cost.   
In response to the question as to the size of the space, the Chair responded that it had been measured at approximately 7 feet by 11 feet.   
A suggestion was made that it should be sold to the purchaser for the market price of the adjacent Strata Lot 23, this being $\$154.00$ per square foot.  

Upon the vote being taken, one person abstained (the proposed purchaser), there were no opposing votes with the remaining 19.25 votes in favour of the Special Resolution #1.  

SPECIAL RESOLUTION #2 The Chair read the Resolution as follows:  

SPECIAL RESOLUTION #2 -VOTING  

WHEREAS the Strata Property Act of B.C. under section 53 (2) provides that a Strata Corporation may, by By-Law, provide that the vote for a Strata Lot may not be exercised if the Strata Corporation is entitled to register a Lien against that Strata Lot under section 116;  

BE IT RESOLVED THAT a vote for a Strata Lot may not be exercised, except on matters requiring a unanimous vote, if the Strata Corporation is entitled to register a Lien against that Strata Lot under section 116 of the Strata Property Act.  

A Motion was made by Karin Mclntosh and seconded by Jason Priestley that the Special Resolution #2 be approved as having been read.  

# Discussion  

The Chair explained that the Strata Property Act provides that a Strata Corporation can, by way of a By-Law, allow a Strata Lot vote not to be exercised, if the Strata Corporation is entitled to Register a Lien against a Strata Lot, a Lien can be Registered if the Strata Lot has failed to pay the Strata Corporation, Strata fees, Special Levies and other amounts as provided for under section 116 of the Act. The Condominium Home Owners Association recommends, and most Strata Corporations in B.C. have such a By-Law, as it would not be fair for those who have not contributed towards operating expenses, to have a vote as to how the Strata's funds may or may not be expended.   
There was counter argument from several of the Owners that there were extenuating circumstances, as it appeared that the square footages having been measured as "habitable area" for the purposes of the Strata Plan filed at the Land Titles Office may not agree with the actual as built amounts.  

The square footage is used for calculating the Unit Entitlements, which under the Strata Property Act, are used to calculate the Strata Fee contributions, attributes to each Strata Lot. These Owners felt very strongly that the Strata Plan needs to be re-surveyed, confirm accurate square footages and if found to be different to be used to recalculate the Unit Entitlements reflecting what the Owners felt were correct Strata Fees, not Strata Fees presently being charged.  

Upon the vote being calld, there was a miscount, as it did not add up to the 19.61 votes present. Upon the vote being taken again, there were 13.61 votes in favour and 6 votes opposed the Resolution, therefore Special Resolution #2 was passed.  

SPECLAL RESOLUTION #3 The Chair read the resolution as follows:  

# SPECIAL RESOLUTION #3 - ELIGIBILITY FOR COUNCIL  

WHEREAS the Strata Property Act of B.C. under section 28 (3) provides that a Strata Corporation may, by By-Law, provide that no person may stand for Council or continue to be on Council if the Strata Corporation is entitled to register a Lien against that Strata Lot;  

BE IT RESOLVED THAT no person may stand for Council or continue to be on Council with respect to a Strata Lot if the Strata Corporation is entitled to register a Lien against that Strata Lot under section 116 (1) of the Strata Property Act.  

A Motion was made by Jason Priestley and seconded by Karin McIntosh that Special Resolution #3 as having been read, be approved.  

# Discussion  

In response to a question as to when this Resolution would take effct if passed, it was responded that as per the Act when filed at the Land Titles Office. This must be done within 60 days from the vote having been taken place at a General Meeting.   
One of the Owners felt very strongly that, due to the extenuating circumstances where Strata Fees appeared to be based upon square footages which did not seem to match habitable area, it was not fair to disallow those Owners who are not making payment of Strata Fees from participating in the Strata Council.   
Counter arguments were expressed that if Owners were not making Strata Fee payments, in effect, not contributing towards any of the expenses of the Strata, it is not fair for those Owners to be making decisions on behalf of the Strata Corporation as to how the funds are spent, funds which are being paid by other Owners.  

Upon the vote being taken, there were 13.61 votes in favour and 6 votes opposed, therefore Special Resolution #3 was approved.

(9) For the period from the earlier of the date on which the first strata lot is occupied, or the date on which the first strata lot is conveyed to a purchaser until the first annual budget is approved by the first annual general meeting, the owners, including the ownerdeveloper, shall pay to the strata corporation their proportionate share of the estimated monthly common expenses in accordance with the budget prepared under subsection (7).  

(10) If the actual common expenses during the period referred to in subsection 98) exceed the estimated common expenses for that period, the owner-developer shall pay the excess.  

(11)  Common expenses attributable to a separate section shall be apportioned by the executive of that separate section in the following manner:  

(a) Common expenses except electricity shall be allocated to all strata lots in the separate section and shall be borne by the owners in that section in the proportion that the unit entitlement of each such strata lot bears to the aggregate unit entitlement of all strata lots in that section or as otherwise set out in the current budget of that separate section.  

(b) The cost of each owner of a strata lot of the electrical power supplied to it if not separately metered for that strata lot shall be borne by the owners in proportion that the unit entitlement of their strata lot bears to the aggregate unit entitlement of all strata lots in that section.  

(12)  At the first annual general meeting, the strata corporation shall cause to be prepared a budget for a period commencing on the date of the first annual general meeting and ending on the first anniversary of the last day of the month during which the first annual general meeting is held. Such annual budget shall allocate common expenses as between the separate sections of the strata corporation. After that, all owners, including the owner-developer, shall, subject to subsection (4), pay a monthly assessment based on that budget determined in accordance with their unit entitlements.  

(13)  Where, at the first annual general meeting, the budget shows that the estimated common expenses as shown on the interim budget exceeded the actual common expenses, the owners, including the owner-developer, shall receive from the strata corporation a rebate of their contribution to the common expenses, based on the unit entitlement of the strata lots for which their contribution was paid, and the period of time during which their contribution was paid.  

(14) At each annual general meeting subsequent to the first annual general meeting, the strata corporation shall prepare an annual budget for the following 12 month period and, after that, all owners shall, subject to this bylaw, pay a monthly assessment in accordance with their unit entitlement.

(2)  A notice given by post shall be deemed to have been given 48 hours after it is posted. (3)  An owner may at any time in writing advise the strata corporation of a change in address at which notice shall be given, and thereafter the address specified shall be deemed to be the address of the owner for the giving of notices. (4)  The word "notice" shall include any request, statement or other writing required or permitted to be given by the strata corporation or the executive of a separate section to the owner of the strata lot.
