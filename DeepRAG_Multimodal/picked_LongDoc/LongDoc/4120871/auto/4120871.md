# How the safety belt became a safety standard. The story of the SpanSet company.

# Fifty years ago the world was very different, cars had no seat belts. But the hour had come for a small Swedish ribbon weaving company.  

Today it is hard to imagine that a few decades ago, most cars were shipped without seat belts. In other respects, too, little attention was paid to accident prevention at that time, and so many collisions, from which today one would emerge unscathed, had fatal consequences.  

In order to counter this, the Swedish car company Volvo approached the ribbon weaving companies AB Textilkonst and Klippan at the end of the 1950s, with instructions to develop a safety belt for its vehicles.  

Volvo was already building very sturdy cars that withstood the harsh Swedish winters and other tests, but it wanted to continue to improve the safety of the occupants.  

Together with Volvo engineers, Klippan developed the first car safety belt in the world, made of high-strength fabric ribbon. It was installed in models Amazon and 544 for the first time in 1959 and caused a lot of astonishment in the public, but also ensured an enduring image of Swedish inventions as both pioneering and durable.  

# How we replaced ropes and chains  

The car safety belt was a great success, and soon other manufacturers had also installed it. Thanks to the great demand, Erik Ehnimb, co-owner of Klippan, was able to found the SpanSet company in Malmö in 1966.  

The ribbons produced by SpanSet were quickly and enthusiastically employed in many other areas, where up to that point chains and wire ropes had been used, as in the case of the transport of paper. The customers appreciated the enormous load-bearing capacity of the new lashing and lifting belts.  

In 1967, Mr. Ehnimb founded SpanSet AG in Hombrechtikon in the Zurich highlands, and additional companies in Germany, Italy, France and England. Later, companies in Asia, America and Australia were added, thus forming a global distribution network.  

SpanSet UK are based in a modern, purpose-built factory in Middlewich, Cheshire and has been in operation for over 40 years. The company’s vast experience in webbing based products provided the perfect background to develop over 20 years ago the innovative range of height safety equipment.  The range covers all applications from Fall Arrest and Work Positioning to Rope Access and the Gotcha Rescue Range.  

SpanSet continue to live up to their international heritage of innovations in design with new developments in products and services.  The new developments enable us to push beyond the basic European Standards for design in Height Safety equipment.  

# How our inventions became the norm ...  

The SpanSet products with their load capacity have gained such a good reputation around the world that interntional safety standards have been orientated to it.  

The development of standards for Height Safety equipment has been significantly influenced by SpanSet; for instance, in national working groups that determine what constitutes a standard and in which SpanSet is regularly included.  

SpanSet were part of the team who drafted the standard BS8454:2006 for the delivery of Training and Education for Working at Height and Rescue and the first company to be audited to this standard by the BSI.  

This is how something becomes the norm: by setting a standard. And doing so repeatedly for more than 40 years.  

# ... and our norm influenced new inventions  

This also means that we are often called on during the development of a new product (after all, it will eventually be transported by our belts) and also increasingly offer support as a partner for safety training and consultation.  

This is how SpanSet went from small ribbon weaving company to international forerunner when it comes to Height Safety, transportation and safety – through exceptional performance and recognition.  

# How we let one world first follow the next  

In 1997, SpanSet launched the “Power” sling series as well as the new generation of roundslings with textile wire reinforcement in the protective jacket for maximum tear resistance – even back then capable of bearing up to 50 tonnes.  

In 1992, the Horizontal Safety Line – the first temporary horizontal anchorage line to employ a webbing and ratchet system for pretension, and to give a predictable deflection during a fall.  

The ABS pressure ratchet, another world first, appeared in 1995.  This allows a gradual release of the tensioned ratchet, so that goods at risk of falling could be unloaded safely.  

2001, The Gotcha range of rescue equipment.  The first pre-assembled rescue kits offering remote attachment and recovery of a suspended worker.  Followed by the WRAPPA, the first anchorage sling tested for attachment to a vertical tube on a scaffold structure.  

In 2002, SpanSet launched the Tension Force Indicator (TFI) which is integrated in the tensioning ratchet and indicates the pre-tensioning force.  Thus, the use of lashing equipment became safer and more economical.  

The TFI is now incorporated into the Horizontal Safety Line above.  

Also in 2002 SpanSet established the Modular Height  Safety Training Courses. Moving training away from individually bespoke courses towards industry recognised standard qualifications. CAPCHA the overhead fall arrest system for curtain side vehicles and workshops was launched in 2004.  

Working closely with clients in the offshore Oil and Gas industry SpanSet developed their first “collective measure” for work at height – a temporary decking system in 2004. This design has been developed and improved to become the first product in the Walkabout range of collective measures.  

2005 the Proof Loader Kit was launched – the complete anchorage and testing system for workers to quickly establish and quantify their own anchor points in concrete or geological features.   
2008, another first for SpanSet.  The ATLAS 140 range – the first complete range of products developed specifically to meet the requirements of larger workers.  

# SpanSet – a way to success that always results from being one step ahead!  

We are quite proud of our achievements. After all, they have contributed to safer and easier working conditions around the world – and thus to fewer accidents and lower operating costs.  

We were especially glad to hear the story of a policeman, who during a truck check replaced his official severity with a friendly smile after seeing that the cargo was secured with our products.  

# Meeting standards is good. Setting standards is better.  

The SpanSet brand stands for something. Not only for meeting  international safety standards, but for raising them again and again. For example, the new EU lashing standard would not exist without our lashing belts.  

This is exactly what we stand for with our products, services and consultancy: for more security than is demanded today – namely, as much as is possible tomorrow.  

That is our goal, that is our job and that is our passion. So that those who work with SpanSet can also trust in it in the future – just like the police.

# SpanSet Products – Fit for Purpose  

# Why choose a SpanSet Harness  

SpanSet’s philosophy in product design is to ensure that every product not only complies to the European Standards, but is fit for purpose and also meets the workers expectations. In many cases these two things can be very different, for example our TITAN range of lanyards for extreme environments and our ATLAS 140 range for larger workers. Both designs meet the appropriate standards, but have additional features which enable them to meet the workers more demanding expectations.  

SpanSet harnesses have been designed with the worker in mind. Our design criteria, considers that a full body harness should be constructed from materials that conform to the shape of the worker with minimal restriction, for comfort. They should be easy to fit and adjust, for security. In the event of a fall they should support the user in the right places without undue stretch or distortion as this is when the worker needs it most.  

# SpanSet Products are supplied with:  

- Clear Instructions   
- Serial Number   
- Individual Certification and Inspection   
Record Card   
- Pocket Inspection Guide  

In addition to this all SpanSet Kits are supplied with a Dirt- and UV-protective carrying bag  

# All SpanSet Harnesses offer:  

High quality polyester webbing that is supple and conforms to the users shape  

Highly corrosion resistant fittings, polished for ease of adjustment and fitting.

# Why choose a SpanSet Lanyard  

SpanSet lanyards have been designed with the application in mind. Our design criteria considers, that the lanyard should be of suitable configuration, adequate length for the task without compromising the workers safety, with connectors that allow ease of attachment to other compatible elements. Careful selection will ensure that the worker can carry out their task safely and effectively.  

# General Features and Benefits of SP140 range  

SpanSet have manufactured high quality and performance fall arrest lanyard for over 25 years. The T-Pak shock absorber has been the foundation of our range and has exceeded the performance requirements of EN355 ensuring comfort and safety for workers. In 2008 SpanSet became a market leader by manufacturing the first fall arrest lanyards that were tested and certified to EN355 for 140kg workers – the ATLAS lanyard.  

Now SpanSet are proud to bring you the SP140 shock absorbing pack pushing our fall arrest lanyard performance even further forward.  

# The SP140 shock absorbing pack includes:  

1 Testing and certification to all the EN355 performance requirements using a 140kg test mass   
2	 More clearance height for workers improving on our T-PAK lanyard range   
3 Published clearance height data for 80kg, 100kg, 120kg and 140kg workers in the instruction manual Integrated ring allow the lanyard leg to be clipped back to the shock absorbing pack   
5	 More compact MAX-SPAN configuration giving the lanyard legs a greater effective working length between anchors   
6 A new cover giving better protection to the energy absorbing webbing and making the unit easier to inspect   
7	 The CE label and traceability data is protected inside the pack for increased longevity We also offer the option of Radio Frequency tracer tagging within the labels

Introducing The award-winning SpanSet Dynamic Self Retracting Lanyard  

The SpanSet DSL2 takes safety to a new level - Reducing Fall Clearances – improving Safety!  

The DSL2 keeps the potential fall to a minimum and arrests the fall quicker – The result is increased safety for workers  

-	 At low clearance heights   
-	 When working over structures, machinery or other hazards The DSL2 is a full 2m lanyard when required, but automatically retracts making it always as short as possible in use and keeping falls to the minimum. During a fall the retractor can continue to shorten the lanyard resulting in further reductions in the distance the worker falls.   
The DSL2’s unique features will arrest a falling worker more effectively compared to standard fall arrest lanyards.   
The benefits to a worker are a significant reduction in the safe clearance required below them, increasing their safety.   
SpanSet’s standard range of lanyards already exceed the minimum requirements set out in EN355 by more than $10\%$ .   
The DSL2 takes this to a new level beating the requirements by more than $50\%$ .

# The 3 Categories for the Use of Personal Fall Protection Equipment  

# Work Restraint  

This category of work covers techniques that restrict the movement of the user to prevent them approaching fall hazards. Careful assessment must be carried out first to identify all the relevant fall hazards. An effective technique will then provide an extremely high level of safety.  

# Work Position  

Techniques in this category utilise equipment to suspend the user in their ‘work position’. As the user is then suspended at height, careful selection of the equipment and adequate training are essential in order to provide an effective solution. Work positioning techniques generally require an additional safety or back-up system. This must also be selected using the hierarchy, but it is quite common for fall arrest techniques to be chosen.  

# Fall Arrest  

Fall arrest is the only category that actually allows a fall to take place. The fall arrest system then reacts by arresting the fall in a controlled manner. Careful consideration must be given to ensure that the system selected is suitable for use in the intended orientation and that there is adequate clearance height below the user to prevent contact with obstacles during a fall.  

For further information visit our website.  

# Risk Assessment  

Where your risk assessment shows a worker can fall, you must carefully plan how you will protect them. There are 3 basic levels of protection; Avoidance, prevention, or mitigation. If work at height can be avoided then the risk of falling is eliminated.  

If it is not possible to avoid working at height ways of preventing a fall should be addressed with preference placed on collective measure which protect all workers. Personal fall protection harnesses should only be used as a last resort.  

In some situations it is not possible to prevent the fall, for example when climbing between various working levels/platforms. In this situation the worker requires some form of protection from the effects of the fall. This  could be done by reducing the fall distance, or by limiting the impact force felt as the fall is arrested. Again collective systems are given preference to a personal fall protection harness.  

It may not always be possible to provide fall protection to eliminate the risk of injury, therefore in these situations then you must take steps to reduce the risk of falling as much as possible, for example through competence training when workers are left with a step ladder as the only method of work.  

If your risk assessment shows that it is acceptable to use personal fall protection your workers will have three ways in which their equipment can be used. It is therefore essential to properly identify environment constraints and the type of protection the workers require. The 3 techniques with which a harness can be used to protect workers are; Work Restraint, Work Position and Fall Arrest. The workers must properly understand the level of risk and function of their equipment in each technique.

# The Benefits of a Modular Training Scheme  

Based upon our commitment to quality and service , it is SpanSet’s aim to provide training and education that supports all of our height safety products and associated techniques. SpanSet’s training courses provide the necessary knowledge of equipment and techniques to allow managers or users to operate safety systems effectively in designated environments.  

The comprehensive, modular based range of training courses have been developed based on worker feedback. This clearly structured approach allows for planned progress to be made towards competency. Each module is a clearly defined block of theoretical information and practical training that can be combined with other modules to create a complete course tailored to your requirements.  

By breaking the courses down into smaller parts the modular approach provides many benefits. Careful selection of modules maximises the relevance of courses to the trainees. A high quality of delivery can be easily  monitored and maintained for consistency. Continual appraisal ensures trainees only progress once each section is successfully completed. Modules are valid for 3 years and additional modules can be added at a later date if required. The approach has made SpanSet height safety courses recognised as the bench mark for proof of competency across industry.  

The Modular approach is under pinned by the foundation module HS1 which must be completed by all trainees. This session which is predominantly education based, sets out the background information required by all those involved in work at height. With the basics covered it is then possible to train workers in different more practical aspects of work at height. The end result is a combination of background information and practical training biased to the needs of the worker.  

# Height Safety for Industry  

Having successfully completed the module HS1, the following practical based training modules can be added to enhance the overall course.

# Industry sectors that use Work Restraint techniques:  

# Work Restraint prevents falls before they happen  

Roof Work  

When a worker is required to approach an unprotected fall hazard, the safest method of access is a Work Restraint System. A Work Restraint System uses equipment to restrict movement, creating a safe working zone and preventing the worker from reaching the fall hazard. Care should be taken when setting up the system to ensure that the safe working zone is effective, as once in place the worker’s level of awareness will decrease. An effective Work Restraint System provides an extremely high level of safety.  

# Why choose SpanSet for Work Restraint equipment?  

As part of SpanSet’s commitment to Height Safety Training, developing the safest work methods and equipment is vital. SpanSet have been heavily involved in promoting work restraint techniques since we began delivering training 15 years ago.  

Facilities Management  

Vehicle Fall Protection  

Work Restraint Systems can be broken down into 4 key components. An Anchor Point, a Connecting Element, a Harness and the Knowledge to use them all safely.  

# Practical solutions for everyday work  

Powered Access  

SpanSet have developed a range of solutions for work on rooftops and near exposed edges. Our knowledge in this area has undergone a continual development in conjunction with a number of major clients and importantly from the experience received through our training department.  

It is essential to ensure that all the components of your system are compatible. The equipment you select may also be suitable for use in a Fall Arrest or Work Positioning System. If you have any doubts as to the suitability of height safety equipment please contact SpanSet for advice.  

![](images/05da93218d0d184bd4155e4239a6bd07e926df6fae28eb2e58abf20de2d0d318.jpg)  

Our products range from temporary solutions through to permanently installed systems. We can supply both ready made solutions for typical work at height environments in the form of kits and bespoke systems made up form a combination of our compatible components/elements.  

![](images/47e59d5bfe2b04cc81cdeb17cbbb58b035ee3e37ef69dac8ce596c55c7016540.jpg)  
Work Restraint prevents falls before they happen  

# 1. Anchor  

The anchor point is the key to a safe personal fall protection system. The type of work that you do and the location you are working in will determine what anchor points are available for you to use and what anchorage devices are suitable. Anchors for work restraint need to be able to withstand at least 3 times the users mass (BS8437), however work restraint systems will normally use anchorage devices approved to EN795. When selecting a suitable anchorage it must be located in a position that will allow the system to prevent a fall.  

# 2. Connector  

The connecting element of a work restraint system must be of a suitable length to limit the workers movement to within the safe working zone. A fixed length lanyard can provide an effective solution, but the lack of adjustment will limit the situations it can be used in. Providing a worker with an adjustable lanyard or adjustable line will enable them to create effective restraint systems to suit their environment.  

![](images/68377dd73bef6ec199a4a9e12f7801142b324f23f13269c771481c292d2e746b.jpg)  

# 3. Harness  

Work restraint systems can incorporate virtually any style of harness. The user of a work restraint system may find the use of a rear attachment beneficial as they can then approach the hazard or work area with the safety system outside their working zone. The use of Belts for restraint is not incorrect, however SpanSet recommend that for most situations a full body harness is preferable providing improved support and security.  

# Training  

Training is an essential part of your Work Restraint solution. To be confident that your employees will not be at risk of falling, they must understand the basic principles involved with planning, using and maintaining the equipment.  

Workers who have little or no experience of work restraint systems or equipment are unlikely to operate them effectively. Workers must understand that the type of equipment on its own will not create a work restraint system, it is the way it is used to prevent falls occurring that is important.  

By selecting the appropriate modules from our modular format you will be able to create a competent worker who is able to assess the task, select the right equipment, carry out pre-use checks and use the equipment safely.

When working in boom mounted mobile elevated work platforms it is recommended that users protect themselves using a Work Restraint System in addition to the safety rails that are built into the basket. It is also important that users of MEWPS are correctly trained in the safe use of the machine and the additional safety equipment. SpanSet recommends that you contact the International Powered Access Federation (IPAF) for details of courses and training providers www.ipaf.org. The Work Restraint System that SpanSet recommends comprises of a full body harness and an adjustable restraint lanyard. The adjustable lanyard allows the kit to be used with a variety of different sized baskets.

Most roof work is likely to take place in an environment where Work Restraint techniques are desirable. Therefore the Roof Kit shown here is designed to be set up to limit a users movement and prevent them falling. It has also been considered that work on a roof will include access and egress. During this time workers may have to use fall arrest techniques and therefore the kit incorporates features to protect the user throughout the entire work task and egress. Both the Lanyard and work position line are adjustable so that users can create effective restraint systems. In addition the lanyard is designed for fall arrest use and in this case the adjustment will also allow the user to reduce the potential fall to a minimum.

Telecoms  

If a worker is required to be in a location where there is no platform and they have to climb or be lowered into place to work, then the safest form of personal protection is Work Positioning. A Work Positioning system uses equipment to hold, or suspend the worker in place to carry out the task, therefore reducing the potential for a fall.  

Utilities  

If the worker is fully reliant upon a work positioning system for their primary support, then a secondary connection is recommended as a back-up. The secondary connection should be selected using the hierarchy to provide a combined solution offering the highest level of safety.  

It is common for an industrial climber to use a fall arrest system for protection during a climb, but once at their work site they add in a work position system to enable them to carry out the task using both hands.  

Work position systems when incorporated with a secondary system require staff with the correct aptitude and training in order to operate them effectively.  

Industrial Rope Access  

A basic Work Position system is comprised of 5 parts. An Anchor Point, a Connecting Device that Supports the worker, a Connecting Device for  

Confined Space  

# Why choose SpanSet for Work Positioning equipment?  

For over ten years SpanSet have been developing and presenting training and equipment solutions including rescue for the telecoms industry. SpanSet have a wide range of courses and equipment solutions specific to this field, for example the rigging and lifting at height courses for telecoms riggers. In addition to the range already in place SpanSet are working closely with customers to provide bespoke solutions where required.  

Access and Backup, a Harness and the Knowledge to use them all safely.  

SpanSet is a full member company of the Industrial Rope Access Trade Association as a manufacturer of equipment and a training organisation. As manufacturer SpanSet has worked with many IRATA operating companies to develop equipment solutions for a variety of applications. SpanSet also work with the Emergency Services and Military to provide bespoke solutions for their particular requirements in search and rescue.  

# 1. Anchor  

The anchor points chosen together with their position and their strength can have a substantial effect on the effectiveness of a work position system. The anchor should be unquestionably sound, possibly being a structural element or one tested / certified to EN795. The chosen location of the anchor point or the use of a mobile anchor is important to allow the worker to position adjacent to the work task. Both the primary and secondary systems will require an anchorage and the strength of the anchor point must therefore be sufficient for the primary system (positional) as well as the secondary (potentially fall arrest).  

# 2. Connector (Support)  

The primary connector for a work position system must be able to support the worker and hold them in the correct position to be able to work hands free. This means that the connector should be able to adjust easily to allow the worker to set the position effectively. The most common way to do this is with a work position lanyard. However many devices are available for work positioning that include different features suitable for specific applications.  

# 3. Connector (Access and Back-up)  

The Secondary Connector must be able to support the worker in the event of the primary system failing or when climbing the secondary connector must be capable of supporting the worker should they fall. As a result of this it is common for the secondary connector to be a fall arrest system. Suitable fall arrest systems include flexible line fall arresters, guided type fall arresters and fall arrest lanyards. The main considerations in selection being how it works in conjunction with the primary system.  

# 4. Harness  

The harness must be able to support the workers body in a comfortable position while they are working. The type of support offered by the harness depends whether it is being used to hold the worker in tension as they balance on a structure, or to suspend the worker freely from the structure. If the harness is used for climbing and working on a structure then it should be a full body harness with a suitable work-positioning belt. If the worker is suspended freely then the harness should support them in a seated position.

# Training  

Training is an important part of a work positioning system because the techniques used are varied and can be complex. The ability to thoroughly risk assess and plan the whole process is vital. There are many stages to the work, from safe access, secure positioning, equipment maintenance and finally emergency planning. If these are not properly addressed then workers will be left at risk. SpanSet training courses are designed to address all when implementing a work positioning technique as part of your safe method of work.  

The key to an efficient work positioning system is being able to adapt the available techniques and equipment to suit the environment you will be working in. The SpanSet training modules help you to select the most appropriate courses and combined with the wealth of experience held by our training team ensure you get the best support when planning work positioning projects.

# Confined Space Solution  

Confined space workers must consider rescue and retrieval as part of their planning. The incorporation of a harness can make rescue and retrieval simpler even where the task does not include exposure to work at height. Where the task includes work at height the harness becomes more integral to the overall solution for access, egress and recovery.  

If the primary means entry to a confined space is by ladder, or steps, it is acceptable for a worker to be connected to a Recovery Block. In the event of a fall, or incapacitation the worker can be raised or lowered. This ‘system’ is for emergency use only and must not be used for manriding i.e. suspension of a worker, unless it is a rescue situation.  

If the only means of entry into a confined space is by ‘man-riding’ the worker must be raised & lowered by a lifting system, such as the SpanHoist. This operation must then be protected by a back-up system, such as a Recovery Block. This arrangement ensures that whilst in ‘suspension’ a worker is always protected by two separate systems.  

# Tripod Bundle  

Tripod Bundle consists of a Tripod, Recovery Block and brackets to suit both tripod and block.  

-	 Tripod provides an EN795 class B rated anchorage   
- 	 For up to 2 workers   
- 	 Crown of Tripod includes two anchorage eyes   
The eyes can carry a pulley   
- 	 The pulley diverts the lifeline of the recovery block   
-	 A Spanhoist can be suspended from the tripod   
Spanhoist system is for lifting and lowering   
Recovery block is normally mounted onto the leg of the tripod   
-	 To mount the block a special bracket is used   
-	 Maximum height of tripod is 2.3m, diameter 1.55m   
-	 Tripod is easy to set up & dismantle  

# SpanHoist II  

This is a preassemble kit for personal, or assisted access into confined spaces. The kit is designed to allow a worker to be lowered, or lower themselves into a confined space. The worker can then raise themselves up out of the confined space, or the worker can be remotely raised. In the event of a recovery the kit can be operated by a rescuer remotely from the anchor point to lift the casualty out. The kit includes one way pulleys for efficient lifting and controlled descents as well as a footloop and locking mechanism for security.

# Industry sectors that use Fall Arrest techniques:  

# Fall Arrest limiting the distance and effects of a fall  

Scaffolding  

High Bay Pallet Racking  

Where a worker requires freedom of movement to climb between platforms, or move around on a structure, then it may not be possible to remove the risk of a fall completely. In these situations it is important to mitigate the consequences of the fall as far as possible. This is a common situation in areas where workers build, maintain or dismantle structures such as Scaffolding, steel frame buildings, tower cranes or racking systems.  

Wind Energy  

Tower crane erection and maintenance  

Fall arrest systems work by keeping the fall distance and impact forces to within known limits. Different items of equipment achieve this in different ways and understanding this enables users to select the most appropriate method for their application. The fact that this type of protection allows the worker to fall also means that consideration must be given to rescue or recovery of a suspended worker.  

The training required for the use of fall arrest equipment should include both theoretical and practical sessions so that users can match their understanding to real life applications. The theory side must look at all aspects from planning through to implementation and rescue.  

All fall arrest equipment will limit the impact forces applied to the user to below 6kN. Some equipment achieves this by limiting the potential fall thus preventing the user gathering momentum. Alternatively equipment can allow the fall to occur and slow the falling user down over a known distance by dissipating the energy generated.  

When considering clearance heights users should take into account obstacles such as plant, machinery, structural elements as well as platforms or floor levels. Items that limit the fall distance generally require anchorages above the user to be effective, but are better suited where clearance height is a problem. Where the only anchorages are at or below the users foot level then equipment that can dissipate energy are generally more appropriate, but they will require increased clearance height.  

Rescue planning may seem daunting, but SpanSet pioneered the provision of rescue solutions designed for one worker to rescue another. Rescue solutions range from improvised methods utilising available access equipment, to the complex and bespoke techniques of the emergency services and through to simple pre assembled kits. The key is selecting the right one for the user and their application.  

![](images/4eecce432300d1e2adb82b5d062915e7b555b3552ec91b1c45f0c4f23348d952.jpg)  

# 1. Anchor  

The anchor point for a Fall Arrest System must be able to withstand the shock load generated as the fall is arrested. Therefor e in every situation SpanSet recommends that the worker selects an anchor point that is unquestionably sound, or an anchor device which is tested to EN795.  

# 2. Connector  

The connector in a fall arrest system performs the critical function of arresting the workers fall. The aim is to have as little “slack” as possible, so that the connector will begin to arrest the fall as soon as possible. However some connectors also include energy absorbing elements that are able to reduce the impact force of the fall when there is significant “slack” in the system. The choice of connector may be influenced by the clearance height available below the user  

![](images/fce15f39642eb575f22984b8f5a2173c423ceb8c7030e8f4aacb0c1f0d8f7fe1.jpg)  

# 3. Harness  

The harness must be able to support the workers body in the correct position as the fall is arrested. The European standard ensures the harness will always be strong enough to do its job, however it is essential that the worker has the correct size of harness for it to function properly. It must also be practical and comfortable in use while the worker is moving and carrying out their normal tasks.  

# Training  

Training is the essential final element in a Fall Arrest System, because of the inherent risks of incorrect use. The worker must be certain that each of the components already described has been chosen correctly and that they are fully competent in there use. If the worker is not able to understand the correct use, or the potential consequences of misuse, then the employer has a legal responsibility to address this through training. There are no second chances when a worker falls. SpanSet has a range of modular training courses that are designed to be added together to achieve the appropriate level of training for your work force.

During the erection and dismantling of scaffold structures it is often necessary to use personal fall protection. The choice of equipment should take into account the demands of the scaffolder as he carries out his work.  

The Spanset Scaff kit comprises of a full body harness with a rear attachment and reinforced shoulder pads. This helps keep equipment out of their working area and adds comfort / durability when carrying scaffold tubes. The lanyard incorporates a steel scaffold hook and is $1.75\mathsf{m}$ in length plus connectors. Users can attach the lanyard directly onto tubes and have sufficient reach to carry out most activities.

# FALL ARREST  

For many workers carrying out routine tasks Work at Height can form a part of their role. Providing adequate protection for these workers can be difficult as the work often varies depending upon their task.  

The SpanSet Tradesman solution provides a variety of options in one compact kit. The harness has front and rear attachment points and is simple to fit. The lanyard supplied has coloured adjustment loops that allow workers to reduce falls or even prevent them altogether making it ideal for fall arrest or use in mobile platforms. To ensure the lanyard can be anchored securely it is supplied with an autolock karabiner and a sling for attaching to larger structures.

# Industry sectors that require Rescue & Evacuation:  

# Emergency Response – Why SpanSet can help you find a solution?  

Construction  

If you have selected a method of working that could result in a worker being suspended in a harness, for example fall arrest, or work positioning techniques, then you must consider the rescue implications.  

If the worker is able to move, or relieve the pressure points, then the side effects can be dramatically reduced. However in the case of an unconscious worker the side effects continue unchecked and rescue is the only option. The time it takes for this condition to affect a person can vary greatly, so having an effective solution at hand for a speedy resolution is essential.  

![](images/c6e3f76195fbb427d84796fcadc4d340acb020ba83ce08946eb2e6af349f0402.jpg)  

Telecoms  

Offshore Oil and Gas  

Rescue for personnel suspended at height is an issue that needs addressing for workers, whether they are at 2m or 200m. Traditionally a great deal of emphasis has been placed on this area by those working in extreme environments and quite rightly so. It also applies however to areas that appear more straightforward, but in these areas it is seldom addressed.  

There are several approaches to rescue provision, 1st Response Rescue, Emergency Response Teams and the Emergency Services, each approach having it’s own merits and disadvantages. The rescue equipment can also take many different forms all with different levels of risk, training requirements, aptitude and commitment.  

Emergency Services  

Unconsciousness or death can occur to a suspended casualty even though they may not be injured after their initial fall. This is due to a decrease in the effective circulation of oxygenated blood around the body caused by a combination of factors, such as body position, compression by the harness and a lack of muscle pumping of venous blood.  

It is therefore important to identify the solution that is right for your application. In order to do this you must consider all the variables such as the equipment they are using, where they are using it and the capability of the users. The GOTCHA™ Rescue Range has been designed to provide simple, pre-assembled solutions for a variety of applications.  

# Another aspect of emergency planning that can be confused with Rescue is Evacuation.  

A useful definition between Rescue and Evacuation is:

# Choosing the right rescue solution for your workers  

# 1st Response Rescue  

$^+$ Available as an on-site rescue solution   
$^+$ Immediate response   
$^+$ Often application specific   
$^+$ Can be carried out safely by a fellow worker or supported by the Emergency Services Requires a commitment from fellow workers   
-	 Workers require training and refresher opportunities for it to be effective  

This is a great solution for short term tasks or for contractors who need to provide a self contained solution for work at height.  

# Emergency Response Teams  

$^+$ Available as an on-site rescue solution   
$^+$ Fast response   
$^+$ Should cover all issues on the specific site   
$^+$ Carried out safely by staff selected and trained for the purposes identified   
$^+$ Able to work alongside the Emergency Services   
- 	 Requires a commitment from the site to set up a team and maintain its currency   
-	 Requires constant appraisal to ensure new work tasks can be covered  

This can be an expensive option, however larger sites may prefer this option as the team are able to cover many different work areas or tasks.  

# Emergency Services  

$^+$ Equipped to cope with a wide range of situations   
$^+$ Professional personnel   
$^+$ Skills and knowledge regularly refreshed   
-	 Should not be considered as a first response solution for work at height   
-	 Availability cannot be controlled by the site   
-	 Response times will vary depending upon external factors   
-	 Site specific issues may only be possible with consultation  

![](images/10229962c1dce6231232c18352141b67d346a511ec0cc0091455dbac1aaee82f.jpg)  

The Emergency Services provide an excellent service, but are only able to address issues that they are aware and trained to perform. This is an option that many workers rely upon without actually checking that the service is capable of meeting their expectations.  

# 1. Casualty  

What we know:  

-	 They are suspended from an anchor point -	 They are wearing a full body harness -	 They are at risk from the effects of suspension -	 Whilst suspended it is virtually impossible to provide even basic first aid  

# 2. Rescuer  

What is required:  

-	 They must address their own safety first -	 They must be able to act calmly and effectively -	 They must have regular practice in the techniques for rescue -	 They should reassure the casualty  

# 3. Equipment  

What is required:  

-	 It must recover the casualty to a point of safety with minimal risk to the casualty or rescuer   
-	 It must be simple to operate   
-	 It must be designed for the job it is being asked to perform

# Annual Inspection & Testing Service  

European Standards dictate that all items of PPE for work at height and all safety systems undergo a periodic examination by a competent person. In addition, in the UK, “BS 8437:2005  Code of practice for selection, use and maintenance of personal fall protection systems and equipment for use in the workplace.” Section 13.1.2 –States “Formal inspection procedures should be put in place by employers to ensure that personal fall protection equipment is given a detailed inspection (“thorough examination”) by a competent person before first use and at intervals not exceeding 6 months (or 3 months where the equipment is used in arduous conditions), and after circumstances liable to jeopardise safety have occurred.  

SpanSet can perform the thorough inspections required by legislation and/or equipment manufacturers. We can also provide training for Competent Persons and therefore the combination of your staff and our services can increase the safety and ensure compliance.

# Installations  

For some tasks the measures you employ may be temporary, providing safe working conditions for the duration of the works and removed upon completion. This approach has limitations in that installation and removal of a temporary system may include some risk and can be time consuming.  

In the case of tasks carried out regularly or repeatedly in locations where access is required more often a permanently installed safety system offers a better solution.  The advantages are that once installed a permanent system provides safe conditions for all users.  It is simple to use, easy to maintain and is unobtrusive having very little impact on the surrounding environment.
