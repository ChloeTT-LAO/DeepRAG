In order to compete effectively in the marketplace, independent financial advisors are increasingly relying on technology service providers to help them provide comparable services cost effectively and efficiently, according to Cerulli Associates. In addition, IBDs and RIA firms have been incented to enhance the sophistication of their technology platforms in order to attract financial advisors from larger financial institutions, according to Cerulli Associates. In addition, we believe, based on a report from Cerulli Associates, that financial advisors generally favor technology solutions that enable them to spend more time on asset allocation, fund and manager selection and client interaction, rather than on administrative or technology-related activities. Based on a report from Cerulli Associates, we believe that advanced technological support is a key driver for growth in an independent financial advisor s business. For example, an advanced technology platform with fully integrated tools helps reduce the need for the manual processing of data and the use of multiple incompatible technology applications, allowing financial advisors to spend more time interacting with their clients, while also potentially allowing the financial advisor to reduce technology-related costs.

If Rule 3a-4 were to cease to be available, or if the SEC were to modify the rule or its interpretation of how the rule is applied, it could have a substantial effect on our business. Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. serves as the investment adviser to four mutual funds. Mutual funds are registered as investment companies  under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, together with related regulations and interpretations of the SEC, impose numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including recordkeeping requirements, limitations on advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities, and detailed operating requirements, including restrictions on transactions between an adviser and its clients, and between a mutual fund and its advisers and affiliates. The fiduciary obligations of investment advisers to their clients require advisers to, among other things, consider the suitability of the investment products and advice they provide, seek  best execution  for their clients  securities transactions, conduct due diligence on third-party products offered to clients, consider the appropriateness of the adviser s fees, and provide extensive and ongoing disclosure to clients. The application of these requirements to wrap fee programs is particularly complex and the SEC has in the past scrutinized firms  compliance with these requirements. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose fines and sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and has the power to restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Though we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and the rules and interpretations promulgated thereunder, our failure to comply with such laws, rules and interpretations could have a material adverse effect on us.

First, a majority of our revenues are derived from fees charged as a percentage of the assets that are managed or administered on our technology platform by financial advisors. These revenues are recorded under revenues from assets under management or administration. Our asset-based fees vary based on the types of investment solutions and services that financial advisors utilize. Asset-based fees accounted for approximately $78\\%$ , $73\\%$ and $77\\%$ of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The percentage of our total revenues represented by asset-based fees declined in the year ended December 31, 2009 principally due to the significant decline in the market value of the assets on our technology platform resulting from fluctuations in the securities markets, particularly from September 2007 to March 2009, and also due to our entering into a significant license agreement in 2008. U.S.-based equities appreciated significantly during the remainder of 2009 and throughout 2010 and contributed to an increase in our assets under management or administration, and our resulting revenues from asset-based fees. In future periods, the percentage of our total revenues attributable to asset-based fees is expected to vary based on fluctuations in securities markets, whether we enter into significant license agreements, the mix of assets under management, or AUM, and assets under administration, or AUA, and other factors. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $\\$64$ billion of investment assets subject to asset-based fees were managed or administered utilizing our technology platform by approximately 13,800 financial advisors in approximately 307,000 investor accounts.

Licensing fees accounted for $19\\%$ , $24\\%$ and $20\\%$ of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Fees received in connection with professional services accounted for the remainder of our total revenues.

Our value allocation methodology applies the principles set forth in the AICPA Practice Aid Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The Practice Aid defines appropriate methods to allocate enterprise value to common shares when multiple share classes exist. Based on various factors, including the stage of a company s life and the timing and likelihood of various liquidity events, one method of allocation may be more appropriate than the others. We considered, but did not use, the probability-weighted expected return method due to the number of assumptions for each scenario that are difficult to estimate, and the fact that our most likely liquidation event was an initial public offering. Additionally, we did not apply the liquidation method because, as the Practice Aid indicates, it would be inappropriate for a later-stage company such as ours to use that method to allocate value to the various share classes. Furthermore, the more imminent a liquidity event becomes, the more aligned the liquidation model and option pricing model become in attributing value to each share class. Accordingly, we used the option pricing method, as defined in the Practice Aid, which treats each class of equity as having a  call option  o the enterprise value. The option pricing method considers the economic preferences and other rights attributable to each share class, resulting in a price for each of our share classes, including our common stock. Our valuations of our common stock also reflected a discount for lack of marketability, adjusted over time to reflect the expected likelihood and timing of a liquidity event subsequent to each valuation date. No other discounts were applied in determining the value of our common stock. ",

The revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue arrangement guidance. The first change relates to the determination of when individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. The second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables. This guidance also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple-element revenue arrangements. The guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, but early adoption is permitted.

Goodwill is evaluated for impairment each year using a two-step process that is performed at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The Company has concluded that it has a single reporting unit. The first step is a comparison of the fair value of an internal reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to a determination of the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The implied value of the goodwill is determined as of the test date by performing a purchase price allocation, as if the reporting unit had just been acquired, using currently estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, together with an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole. The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon information available regarding prices of similar groups of assets, or other valuation techniques including present value techniques based upon estimates of future cash flow.

The value allocation methodology applies the principles set forth in the AICPA Practice Aid Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The Practice Aid defines appropriate methods to allocate enterprise value to common shares when multiple share classes exist. Based on various factors, including the stage of a company s life and the timing and likelihood of various liquidity events, one method of allocation may be more appropriate than the others. The Company used the option pricing method, as defined in the Practice Aid, which treats each class of equity as having a  call option  on the enterprise value. The option pricing method considers the economic preferences and other rights attributable to each share class, resulting in a price for each of the share classes, including common stock. The valuations of common stock also reflected a discount for lack of marketability, adjusted over time to reflect the expected likelihood and timing of a liquidity event subsequent to each valuation date. No other discounts were applied in determining the value of the Company s common stock. There was inherent uncertainty in the estimates used in the valuations.

Under the two class method, net income is allocated between common stock and other participating securities based on their respective participating rights.

Therefore, the two class method of calculating net income per common share has been applied. Basic net income per common share excludes dilution for potential common stock issuances and is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, unless they are anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, convertible preferred securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as their inclusion on an as if converted basis would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, the convertible preferred securities are considered anti-dilutive as a result of such securities not having the contractual obligation to participate in losses of the Company. For the calculation of diluted net income per common share, the basic weighted average number of shares is increased by the dilutive effective of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method.
