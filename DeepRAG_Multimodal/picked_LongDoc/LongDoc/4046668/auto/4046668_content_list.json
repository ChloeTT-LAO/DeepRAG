There are no titles to that land, however, so tenure is insecure and the right to buy, improve and resell land is absent. This reduces the incentive for an individual to make long-term investments in improving the productivity of the land, including the initial investment of clearing forest land for agricultural purposes.Progress toward issuing formal titles for land has progressed extremely slowly, primarily because it is almost impossible to get the required consensus before land is alienated.Moreover, even the 2 or 3 per cent of land that has a freehold or leasehold title cannot be sold to non-nationals, and nationals do not value highly the certificate of title because they fear conflict with other groups who may claim customary right to that land.Hence, there is a major divergence between the private and social value of land, leading to gross underutilization of, and underinvestment in land.in addition, without land titles as collateral, famers have difficulty obtaining long-term credit for investment in agriculture.Clearly the government needs to make a much bigger investment in finding ways to improve the security of customary land tenure and to speed up the process of issuing new titles and transferring existing titles.

However, the corollary of this has been that increasing proportions of export tree crop production, urban commercial business activities and jobs in the bureaucracy previously owned or held by non-nationals are now in the hands of nationals and their real incomes have increased substantially. According to Garnaut and Baxter (1983:66) the increase in the share of market GDP accruing to nationals in the late 1970s is a reversal of the trend during the 1960s and early 1970s. This suggests that incomes of nationals grew less rapidly in the 1960s and early 1970s and more rapidly in the rest of the 1970s than the aggregate data in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 suggest. However, Garnaut and Baxter also note that, by the end of the 1970s, nationals' share of production was stabilizing at a high level. Lack of growth in aggregate GDP per capita in the 1980s thus reflects a loss in real income evenfor nationals. ",

However, if a country's terms of trade change over time the purchasing power of traded production also changes. A more accurate measure of the real value of production would adjust for the effects of changes in the terms of trade. Papua New Guinea's terms of trade deteriorated markedly in the 1970s and 1980s whereas for other developing countries, on average, the opposite occurred. Adjusting for this fact shows Papua New Guinea to have done even worse since 1973. Growth rates for real per capita GDP, after adjusting for the terms of trade change, are -2.3 per cent for 1973-80 and -1.5 per cent for 1980-86 (for 1965-73 the growth rate remains 4.2 per cent), well below the unadjusted rates shown in Table 1.2.

In the 1960s, coffee and cocoa were the key sources of export growth. Then, from 1974, palm oil exports began to grow (Figure 1.1). However, the growth in agricultural exports was eclipsed during the period 1972-75 by the export of massive volumes of copper and gold from Bougainville (Figure 1.2). Exports did not expand much in the latter half of the 1970s; indeed Papua New Guinea's export growth performance then was as poor as that of sub-Saharan Africa (see Table 1.3). But in the 1980s exports of some commodities expanded again. Between 1980 and 1984 the volumes of log and palm oil exports doubled and quadrupled, respectively, and the volume of gold exported in 1985 and 1986 was twice that of earlier years. Given the much greater export volume in the 1980s compared with the 1960s, one might expect to have seen substantial investments in place that were able to provide pemanently higher and growing incomes.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the country's tems of trade fluctuated around a flat trend. However, between 1979 and 1982 they deteriorated substantially and had recovered only a little by 1986. This contrasts with the experience of other developing countries which, on average, have enjoyed a substantial improvement in their terms of trade since 1970. Even industrial economies — hit by rising energy import prices in 1973-74 and 1979-80 - suffered only a modest worsening in their terms of trade compared with Papua New Guinea (Figure 1.3). The fluctuations in prices have varied considerably within the export commodity group, however, with peaks and troughs for individual commodities sometimes coinciding and sometimes offsetting each other (Figure 1.4). The net effect of changes in the country's terms of trade can be seen in Table 1.4. Despite the deterioration in the terms of trade between 1965 and 1986, it was nonetheless possible in 1986 to buy ten times as many imports as it was in 1965 or three times as many as in 1970, given the growth in export volume.

The total overseas debt outstanding in the latter half of the 1970s averaged about one-quarter of GDP, but by the mid 1980s it averaged more than three-quarters of GDP. The debt service ratio has worsened even more, rising from around 4 per cent of exports in the 1970s to an estimated 50 per cent in 1986 (Figure 1.5). As it happens, only part of the increased indebtedness is being channelled into investments.

This is due partly to inadequacies in the health care system, one indicator being the very small number of physicians in the country, and also to the low calorie and protein intake in some regions. School enrolments are also much lower than in other developing countries (especially for females) and, on a per capita basis, Papua New Guinea still ranks as one of the world's most aid-dependent economies. While most of these indicators represent a substantial improvement compared with a decade or so ago, they suggest that health, education and food intake are below the standards of other developing countries.

Close to 90 per cent of the population was involved in subsistence agriculture and was only just beginning to earn and use cash. The monetized part of the economy was closely linked with the Australian economy. A small enclave of large-scale plantations owned by foreign corporations or individuals provided most of the export eamings, budgetary grants from Australia funded most government services, Australian currency was used, and the majority of Papua New Guinea's external trade was with Australia. The average income per capita was in the mid-range for developing countries, but about three-quarters of estimated gross domestic product was spent by the small, affluent enclave. Thus it is not surprising that Papua New Guinea was more agrarian in terms of employment than other developing economies with the same average income per capita. In the early 1960s only one in ten workers in Papua New Guinea had jobs outside of agriculture, compared with one in three for other middle income countries. ",

The most obvious changes are the decline in relative importance of agriculture as mining activities have grown, increased dependence of the economy on foreign trade, and increasing monetization of rural activities. Agriculture's share of GDP was more than 40 per cent in the 1960s, but it fell to around 30 per cent in the mid 1970s. Exports of goods and services amounted to less than 20 per cent of GDP prior to the early 1970s but have accounted for about 45 per cent of GDP in recent years. Meanwhile, subsistence food production has fallen from more than one-quarter to less than one-seventh of total GDP and from nearly two-thirds to less than one-half of agricultural GDP. ",

First, while the agricultural sector of an economy is expected to decline in relative importance with economic growth at home and abroad, this decline is expected to be slower in slower growing economies. Yet in the slow growing economy of Papua New Guinea the agricultural sector's relative importance in GDP has, if anything, declined faster than in other developing countries (Table 1.7). Second, the rate of decline of agriculture, forestry and fishing's share of exports has been dramatic in Papua New Guinea. Until the early 1970s more than 90 per cent of the country's exports were from the primary sector (mainly agricultural) but, since the mid 1970s, that share has been only half as large (Table 1.8). It is true that similar rates of decline have occurred in other resource-rich developing countries, especially oil-exporting countries such as Indonesia. But what is remarkable about Papua New Guinea's export structure, compared with that of other middle income countries, is the extreme dominance of agriculture earlier and the continuing unimportance of manufacturing.

On the output side, villagers have shown a clear tendency to market an increasing proportion of their output for cash. They have devoted a larger share of their productive resources to cash-earning exotic enterprises (for example, export tree crops and broiler production) rather than expanding their marketabie surplus of traditional staple foods. There is also a significant production and consumption of betel nut for cash. Shaw (1984) estimates urban and rural sales of betel nut in the early 1980s to have been of the order of K15-20 million. In the 1960s little more than one-third of the assessed value of agricultural output (including forestry and fishing) was marketed for cash, whereas by 1980 that share had grown to about 60 per cent. In terms of total GDP the value of nonmarketed agricultural production declined from 26 per cent in the late 1960s to 14 per cent in the late 1970s. This is reflected in the share of subsistence food production in total private consumption which fell from 46per cent in the early 1960s to26 percent in the late 1970s (Table 1.10).

On the contrary, what happens in the product and factor markets of other sectors will soon feed back to the agricultural sector, and vice versa. Even the subsistence sector producing perishable (non-tradable) products is affected by changes in the market for tradable goods. It is therefore necessary to examine agriculture's changing role in the economy in an inter-sectoral, open economy framework. The purpose of the next chapter is to use such a framework and draw on standard economic theory to help understand the recent structural changes that have been summarized above.

Consider first a closed economy with only two sectors, agriculture and non-agriculture. If productivity growth is occurring equally rapidly in both sectors, supply curves would shift out at the same rate, as in Figure 2.1. Here we assume the two supply curves coincide initially, and hence they also coincide subsequent to the productivity growth. But because people typically spend a declining proportion of their income on food as their incomes increase, demand grows less for agricultural products than for other goods. Thus the demand curves are shown in Figure 2.1 to shift to the right at different rates in the two sectors. The net result of these two sets of changes is as follows: output of both sectors rises, but less so for agriculture, and the price of agricultural products falls relative to the price of nonagricultural products. Hence the share of agriculture in aggregate national product falls. ",

After the equi-proportional productivity growth has taken place in the two sectors, the increase in the quantities supplied would be the same if prices for the two sets of goods remained unchanged. However the growth in incomes that results from this productivity growth leads to the demand for agricultural goods shifting less than that for non-agricultural goods. Equilibrium in the two markets requires that agricultural output expands only 80 per cent and non-agricultural output 120 per cent, and that the price of agricultural goods falls to 85 while that of non-agricultural goods rises to 115 in the case illustrated.

That is, for developing countries any increase in income leads to a more than proportionate increase in the demand for services, which in turn means the demand for tradable goods grows less than proportionately. So, if productivity growth is equally rapid for non-tradables and tradables, but demand for non-tradabies expands more rapidly than productivity — while demand for tradables expands less rapidly than productivity - the price and quantity of non-tradables relative to tradables will both increase. In that case the share of tradables in GDP will decline. Since we have already demonstrated that within the tradables sector it is likely that agriculture's share of production will decline, it now seems even more likely that agriculture's share of total GDP (tradables plus non-tradables) will decline over time. For that not to happen in a small open economy, agricultural productivity growth has to be substantially greater than productivity growth not only in the non-agricultural tradables sector but also in the non-tradables sector, so as to offset the decline in the relative price of agricultural goods.

This decline was even steeper in terms of the yen or deutschmark. The volume of copper ore and concentrate exported from Papua New Guinea also declined after 1982-83 (Figure 1.2). Thus the real exchange rate has been under pressure to decline through the 1980s. The decline was delayed by the massive growth in overseas borrowings between 1980 and 1984 — in part to finance construction at the Ok Tedi mining site in the early 1980s. But between 1984 and 1986 the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 16 per cent (Table 2.1). A consequence of the depreciation was that other tradable sectors became more competitive. This, together with developments in international commodity markets, is reflected in the increases in kina prices of agricultural export products from 1981. As is evident from Table 2.2, only part of these increases is due to changes in the US dollar prices in intemational commodity markets; the rest is due to the US dollar-kina exchange rate depreciation.

Why have investments from the increased income associated with long-term expansion in export eamings in the mid 1970s, not delivered a permanently higher level of income per capita?Neighbouring Indonesia experienced a similar (though proportionately larger) export boom in the 197os 一 and a similar slump after the early 1980s — which also resulted in a major decline in the relative importance of its agricultural sector (Table 1.7), and for similar reasons (Warr 1985). However, Indonesia invested much of its expanded petroleum revenue in agricultural development and also reduced many of the disincentives which government policies had previously imposed on farmers. As a result, even though Indonesi2's agricultural sector has declined in relative importance, its food and agricultural production per capita has expanded enormously (Table 1.5).4 ",

On a per capita basis, the area used for these latter purposes is less than one-twentieth that of other developing countries (columns 1 and 2). Thus agricultural land (excluding forests) per farm worker is less than one-tenth that of other developing countries, and has been declining over time (column 7).

In both Papua New Guinea and Africa the use of fire as a land clearing mechanism is a common technology. In the African case, if there were no direct lineages from the original proprietor, pemission to use the land was obtained from the chief and the rights to use continued as long as the farmer continued to live in the village and recognized the jurisdiction of the chief. The residence requirement in Papua New Guinea is similar. With prolonged migration away from the village there is a fear that the rights to land may become eroded, so individuals typically wish to return to their plais from time to time in order to preserve such rights.

Moreover, the existence of a tribal system with hereditary chiefs provided a convenient vehicle for the colonial powers to make the chiefs, in effect, trustees for existing and future generations. Papua New Guinea does not have a system of hereditary chiefs so far as the tribal or clan groupings are concerned, so the use of tribal chiefs as trustees — which might simplify land use and transfer — is not available in Papua New Guinea.

The intention was that any plantations which were compulsorily acquired were to be reallocated to the descendants of the customary land owners. While there were some exemptions, the major tree crop industries of copra, cocoa and coffee were covered by the legislation. There is little doubt that the Plantation Redistribution Scheme seriously inhibited improvements in productivity in the plantation sector. In addition, leasehold land transfer is slowed down by the requirement that it be subjected to detailed step-by-step ministerial approval. This delay adds substantially to the cost of transferring a lease. Goldthorpe (1985) mentions the existence of some 200 derelict estates abandoned by their owners, and suggests that the lost cocoa and copra production from these abandoned estates would be worth between 65 and 90 million kina per year.

Such a guarantee required an assessment as to the capacity of the guarantors to meet the guarantee should it be necessary. In its early days the Bank relied heavily for this on the extension officer (didiman) from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock. This often required the detailed preparation of the project by the didiman who then became a de facto loans officer for the Bank. At the same time the didiman took on the responsibility to see that the loans were repaid on time and it is arguable that such a role was counter to the objectives of the didiman as a rural extension officer. Now the Agriculture Bank is developing its own trained extension staff to supervise lending and repayment, but the use of such specialist skills will necessarily add to the cost of lending since previously neither the didiman nor his employer was charging the Bank for his services.

There is therefore no market failure to be overcome here. Nor is there market failure with respect to the monopoly provision of loans in a village so long as there are no barriers to entry by other potential lenders. The fact is that many rural settings are too small in aggregate to attract more than one lender. Hence that lender has a natural, not a contrived, monopoly. Even though he may enjoy high profits, they are not high enough to attract a second lender and so are still the lowest one can expect. If a second lender did enter such a naturally monopolized market, by definition one or both would make losses unless subsidized. The interest rates charged in such isolated markets attract attention because of their large absolute size, particularly for small loans. But when the transaction costs are properly accounted for, it usually tums out that the net rate of interest received by the lender is close to the market rate. That is, the rates are not usurious at all. ",

Credit is like any other good in that the lower the interest rate, the larger the quantity demanded. If a bank is forced by the government to provide some loans at concessional rates to a target group, the bank would be rational to limit the funds available for such purposes — since. they need to be cross-subsidized by other customers — and to provide those loans to their least costly customers in the (often loosely defined) target group. Normally this means a small number of large loans will be made, rather than a large number of small loans, to reduce transactions (including risk) costs. That is, the concessions will tend to be enjoyed by the largest famers in the target group. To cover the cost of this concessional lending, depositors will receive less interest and/or other borrowers will have to pay higher interest rates. And the latter group will include all the smaller farmers who were unable to obtain a concessional loan: for them the subsidy scheme has had the effect of raising, rather than lowering, interest rates. 4 Even if the government used its scarce resources to subsidize the banks permanently in a bid to avoid this division into eligible receivers and less eligible nonreceivers of the concessional loans, the likely outcome is that more large loans would be provided to the eligibles (larger farmers) without many of the less eligibles necessarily graduating to become eligibles.

Other borrowers might even enjoy a drop in the effective interest rate at which they can borrow. Also, with an expansion in the number of commercial bank branches and agencies in rural areas (e.g. at post offices), together with their ability to offer depositors a higher interest rate in the absence of concessions on loans, there would be greater opportunities and incentives for rural people to deposit surplus funds in the banks, thereby expanding the total resources available for lending.

The key source of distortion is the minimum wage system, which was inherited from Australia and ensured, at least until 1983, that the minimum wage kept up with inflation.5 Urban minimum wages doubled in real terms between 1972 and 1976 and through indexation have remained close to the 1976 level ever since. Rural minimum wages, on the other hand, have changed litle in real terms during the past 15 years and have been less than 40 per cent of the urban minimum since Independence (Figure 3.2). The urban minimum wage in the late 1970s was double that in Malaysia and Western Samoa, four times that in the Philippines and Thailand and almost ten times that in Indonesia and Sri Lanka (McGavin 1986:152), even though average per capita incomes in those countries are not greatly different from those of nationals in Papua New Guinea. The fact that there are very high recorded unemployment rates in towns and villages (Table 3.5) suggests that there are many (especially young) people seeking those highly paid jobs. Not all of those job seekers would be idle, of course. In the village they would probably be partially employed at least, but in the cities many young people are idle and contribute to the‘rascal' or law-and-order problem there. ",

During the 1970s, meat consumption rose substantially as diets changed with increased urbanization and monetization, so that by 1979 total meat consumption in Papua New Guinea slightly exceeded the developing country average at about $16~\\mathsf{k g}$ per capita per year (Table 4.1). Much of that consumption growth was due to the increased availability and declining real prices of imported beef, canned meat and chicken. Then, around 1982, the import quotas introduced in 1975 were replaced by prohibitions on imports of high-quality beef, chicken and canned meat (but not mutton flaps). The reduction in available supplies combined with a fall in real GDP per capita in Papua New Guinea resulted in an overall fall in meat consumption from 16 to $13k g$ per capita. It would have fallen much more had it not been for the availability of imported mutton flaps, per capita consumption of which has quadrupled during the 1980s. But had chicken been freely importable, its price would have been almost half what it was in the mid 1980s, in which case consumers would have had a cheaper — and a less fatty — alternative to mutton flaps, and overall meat self-sufficiency would have been little different insofar as imported chicken is a substitute for imported mutton. Similarly, the banning of canned meat imports has done little to affect meat self-sufficiency as the new domestic canning industry still has to import most of its meat, not to mention its machinery and all the tin cans. From the viewpoint of consumers this trade policy has meant higher prices for canned meat and a reduction in the variety of brands available. ",

For example, the Ramu sugar project is providing the country's sugar needs, about 2oo0 tonnes of beef is marketed each year as a result of the government's cattle development projects, close to 10,ooo tonnes of chicken meat is now being produced domestically per year, and so on. But none of these projects looks close to becoming internationally competitive in the foreseeable future. The protected domestic price of the less-refined sugar produced by Ramu was about three times the world price in the mid 1980s; many smallholders in the beef industry have found their managerial skills are insufficient to allow them to compete with larger producers, even at highly protected prices, so an increasing proportion of output from this industry is being supplied by largeholders; and while the broiler industry in Papua New Guinea is becoming more technically efficient in terms of mortality rates and feed conversion ratios, it can continue to do so only by increasing shed sizes which means that production would be in the hands of fewer, but larger, suppliers. In short, the number of employment opportunities created by the government's food import restrictions is smaller than was originally envisaged, and may well be much less than the number of jobs lost through diverting resources away from more-efficient industries.

This lowers the price in kina terms that farmers receive for their tradable products, just as happens when the exchange rate strengthens because of foreign capital investment in and exports from the country's mines (as discussed in Chapter 2).

Processing costs are high by international standards, however, because of Papua New Guinea's high wage structure and because of the large number of species in the country's natural forests so that economies of scale in processing are difficult to obtain. In addition, many timber-importing countries have no tariffs on logs but tariffs on processed timber. These tend to be higher the greater the degree of processing. The effect of this structure of escalating tariffs in the international market for timber products is to depress the price exporters can receive for processed timber relative to that for logs. Together these factors made it extremely difficult for firms to process logs profitably in Papua New Guinea, and some firms who endeavoured to do so in the 1970s have since simply abandoned their plants to avoid further losses.

The policy held firm through the 1970s, but when the terms of trade and balance of payments situation deteriorated during 1980-82 the government's approach changed. In early 1983, it depreciated in step with the Australian dollar and since then the kina has been allowed to depreciate gradually against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, in nominal terms as well as in real terms after adjusting for differences in the inflation rates of Papua New Guinea and its trading partners (Table 2.1).

The average contribution for the 10 years to 1987 was 10 per cent. There has been some build up in the MRSF over this period, however, so receipts into the Fund are a more appropriate indicator of the mining sector's capacity to contribute. During the period 1974-75 to 1981 those receipts averaged over 20 per cent of what internal revenue would have been in the absence of MRSF drawdowns, ceteris paribus. But during 1982 to 1987 that contribution averaged only 7 per cent, amounting to only 1 or 2 per cent of GDP. This rather minor contribution of the mining sector in the 1980s has been a disappointment. The recovery in the price of copper concentrate at the end of the 1970s - which was necessary to cover the rapid rise in mining costs — tumed out to be short-lived (Table 2.4). As a result, profits and therefore taxes from Bougainville Copper Ltd have been low throughout the 1980s, and those from Ok Tedi have yet to begin. ",

This raises the question of what is an optimal trade policy regime for raising a given amount of tax revenue. It is not appropriate to analyse this issue in detail here as it needs to be considered as part of overall tax policy.d Even so, two points are worth making. First, many quantitative barriers and prohibitions on Papua New Guinea's trade could become a source of additional tax revenue simply by converting these non-tariff barriers into tariff barriers. Even if their trade-restricting effects remained unchanged, they would be likely to boost customs revenue substantially. If the protection levels on the most protected items were to be lowered somewhat, the revenue collected from the larger volume of imports could be even greater. In addition, there would be efficiency gains from reducing the average level of protection and the dispersion in the tariff structure. ",

Traditionally, economists have argued vigorously against high taxes on agricultural exports_of developing countries because of the efficiency losses involved, but in a situation where high barriers to imports are in place those efficiency losses are occurring anyway. A tax on imports is equivalent to a tax on exports, in that both forms of tax encourage import-competing production at the expense of production of exportables. There could be a numberof economic advantages tobe gained from a complete overhaul of the trade policy regime which involved removing all barriers to imports and replacing them with a flat rate of tax on exports. One obvious advantage would be the lower cost of collecting export taxes. Already the administrative machinery is in place to collect, say, a 10 per cent levy, while savings could be made from eliminating the customs service which collects import duties. Second, the wide dispersion of rates of protection to import-competing producers would disappear, so there would be additional efficiency gains from reallocating resources among the import-competing industries. Third, if the government made it clear that import restrictions were to be available no longer, fewer resources would be spent on lobbying for this costly form of intervention. Finally, it would be seen as a more equitable form of taxation not only because it would remove the unequal rates of import taxation but also because smallholder tree crops exporters, who currently pay no direct taxes other than the 2.5 per cent export levy, would be seen to be making a larger direct tax contribution, although in fact they are already currently being taxed implicitly, as mentioned earlier, by the policy of import restrictions.

Indeed it may well harm its agricultural sector much less than occurs in other developing countries. This does not alter the fact, however, that Papua New Guinea could enliven its agricultural sector — and indeed the economy as a whole —by reducing the distortions to producer and consumer incentives which its trade and exchange rate policies impose. Allowing the kina to move closer to its equilibrium level would encourage the production of tradables (including agriculture) relative to non-tradable goods and services. Replacing quantitative import restrictions and prohibitions with import tariffs would raise govemment revenue. If the tariffs on the most restricted items were set at levels that were less restrictive than current import barriers, there would be two additional beneficial effects. The efficiency of resource allocation within the import-competing sector of the economy would improve, and agricultural (and other) export sectors would be more able to exploit their comparative advantages because of fewer resources being attracted to uncompetitive import-replacement industries.

As more direct forms of taxation become less expensive to collect, so the need for trade taxes as a means of raising government revenue would diminish and hence the rate of export taxation could be lowered gradually over time. This fom of taxation, it should be reiterated, would need to be a substitute for, rather than an addition to, import restrictive policies if it were not to discriminate against agriculture. There are two major weaknesses in such a proposed policy change. One is that the source of its major economic benefit — the removal of differing rates of price distortion for different importables — is also the source of the main advantage of the present policy regime from the viewpoint of politicians, namely, that it can be used to disperse political favours to politically supportive vested interests. The second and related weakness is that, if import taxes were less than fully reduced to offset the resource reallocative effect of raising export taxes, the outcome would involve an even more inefficient use of resources, especially if the dispersion in import tax rates across industries were to increase. If there is a reasonable probability of the latter occurring, it would probably be better simply to stay with the existing trade policy and work towards reducing the average level and the dispersion of import duties and phasing out quantitative import restrictioris.

The spending of govemment tax revenues would also be difficult to manage.

During the past decade, their end-year deposits have averaged around 20 per cent of M3. What is relevant, however, is how much the money supply would have differed if the change in the end-year deposits of those funds had not taken place, assuming other things remained unchanged. The final column of Table 5.2 shows that this change since 1975 has been very small (no more than 5 per cent) except during the period of extraordinarily high coffee prices in the late 1970s.

This results partly because of lags in the change in the levies following an export price change, and partly because the quantity of exports is also varying with changes in seasonal conditions and, with a lag, in response to price changes. The data in Table 5.3 for coffee illustrate the point. The 1976 price for coffee was more than double that for 1975. Also the quantity of coffee exported rose by 30 per cent, partly in response to the price rise. As a result, the value of coffee exports in 1976 was three times, or K67 million more than in 1975. Yet only K3 million was added to the coffee stabilization fund. The 1977 changes in the export value and fund deposit were much more closely matched, but in 1978 when the price of coffee fell 40 per cent, the levy was still in place and fund deposits grew by a further 37 per cent. Deposits continued to grow in 1979 and 1980 when the coffee price remained fairly stable, and then they were drawn down by only K5 million when the price of coffee fell by one-third and coffee export receipts declined by K45 million in 1981. Export receipts recovered during the next three years, growing nearly 50 per cent in total, yet more money was paid out of the fund than was deposited over this period. ",

That capacity is further stressed by Vasey (1981) who traces the development of the major agricultural systems of Papua New Guinea. These were essentially woody fallow systems where the undergrowth is slashed, the trees cut down, the debris burnt and mixed vegetable gardens established. Traditionally, men carry out the heavy work of clearing, buming and breaking up the large soil clods but thereafter women take over. The gardens are usually based on the stable root crops (sweet potato, taro and yams) along with a wide variety of other crops.

Holdsworth and N'Drawi (1973) document the extensive use of plants for medicinal purposes in Manus Province. Bulmer (1982) lists some twenty-eight species of traditional cultivated food plants involving some 120 cultivars, including more than forty each for sweet potato and taro alone. In addition to the knowledge of plants, Papua New Guineans have developed an extensive knowledge of soil management — including fertility control, tillage practices, irrigation and drainage (Wood and Humphreys 1982). Kesavan and Aburu (1982) also suggest that Papua New Guineans were aware of the need to conserve the genetic diversity in their plants and were able to select cultivars for particular purposes, including the development of soft bananas for babies.

Firms supplying agricultural chemicals, veterinary medicines and farm equipment have become increasingly important sources of agricultural innovation. Pratt (1980) estimates that 50 per cent of agricultural research and development in the United States is carried out by private agencies with particular emphasis on proprietary technology where the gains from the innovation can be captured in the form of royalties and patents. Even in Papua New Guinea, where the farm supply industries have not developed to anywhere near the extent that they have in the industrial countries, the export tree crops sector at least relies on the innovations generated by private firms. The adoption in Papua New Guinea of chemicals such as the fungicide Ridomil and the weedicide Roundup are the result of privately funded research in overseas countries. While there is, as yet, relatively little use of fertilizer in the smallholder production of cocoa and coffee, there is significant usage on large holdings.

Largeholders, on the other hand, are aware of the potential role of agricultural research and development in developing innovations. This has conditioned their willingness to support research from industry funds to the point where, in Papua New Guinea, coffee, cocoa, copra and palm oil research is now being partially funded by means of a levy on all producers of these commodities. Also, in the case of some of the export tree crops which are subject to further processing, the processors of the raw material may support research. In Papua New Guinea the definitive epidemiology of vascular streak dieback in cocoa by Keane (1972) was the result of post-graduate work done at the University of Papua New Guinea, with funding support from the Confectionery Manufacturers of Australia.

In general, knowledge is often a free good. However, access to knowledge is not free because there are costs in searching for the knowledge and the success of any search is related to the capacity to identify the sources of information which are relevant for local agricultural practice. Many countries have benefited from direct transfer. In the United States agriculture had access to a stock of knowledge, as well as the proprietary artefacts, which the European settlers brought with them. Moreover, they benefited from the indigenous crops and practices which had already been developed by the American Indians. Australian agriculture, by contrast, because of different environments, benefited relatively less from such direct transfer and considerable local research and develop ment and adaptation had to take place before the innovation slotted successfully into the local environment. Agriculture in Papua New Guinea certainly has benefited from international technology transfers. Palm oil material from Malaysia and sugarcane varieties from Australia are examples. Another example is the modern broiler industry, which has adopted the technology used in industrial countries (Jarrett and Anderson 1988). In addition, new varieties of vegetables were introduced, evaluated for local performance, and eventually grown in village gardens. In a longer time frame, the original varieties of coconut, cocoa and coffee were all introduced to Papua New Guinea from overseas. ",

This is especially so in plant breeding. where a new high-yielding variety, once released, can be propagated easily. Capturing the gains from research is less difficult for chemical and mechanical innovations where private fims have access to the patent system with royalties to recover costs of research and development. Where the free-rider problem is significant, there is a role for the government in collecting levies from producers to fund research. This is a simple matter in the case of export crops which are channelled through a small number of processing/exporting points. It may be prohibitively expensive to collect a levy from either producers or consumers of many staple food crops, however, in which case the government may consider it worthwhile to fund such research from consolidated revenue rather than see little or none undertaken.

Since the factor prices faced by largeholders often differ markedly from those faced by smallholders (see Chapter 3), technologies could be generated which are much more appropriate for one group than for the other. For example, rubber research in Malaysia has been biased towards selecting for breeding those high-yielding trees which use fertilizer and growth stimulants but require less labour because they have low tapping intensities. The new technologies save land and labour but are intensive in their use of cash inputs and skilled management and so are more appropriate for largeholders than smallholders (Barlow and Peries 1977; Barlow and Jayasuriya 1984). If it were judged that such a bias is undesirable and is more likely to result from private rather than public research institutions, this may be a further reason for setting up public agricultural research stations.6 ",

About 35 per cent of research manpower, excluding extension and administration, is employed in private research centres. When extension and administration are included, the private share is 26 per cent.

Thus, for the country as a whole, the share of research and extension manpower in extension work is perhaps as much as one-fifth or more. This is higher than in Southeast Asia where, in 1974, only one-eighth of research and extension manpower was devoted to extension (Boyce and Evenson 1975). Moreover, in Southeast Asia, retums from further investments were much lower in extension than in research even at that low share of one-eighth (Evenson and Kislev 1975).

The central and provincial governments were unable to mobilize quickly and effectively the necessary resources for a research and extension program to counteract the likely serious consequences of the spread of coffee leaf rust.So the central government established the Coffee Development Agency which is a joint enterprise between the national government, the Coffee Industry Board and the five provinces where coffee production is concentrated. The funds for the agency were obtained by a levy of Ko.1 per kilogram of green coffee with an initial injection of K1.8 million from the national and provincial governments. The Coffee Development Agency realized the need to begin the campaign against coffee leaf rust at the local level, that is, to adopt a bottom-up approach in which the concemed villages are involved directly. The villages are to appoint coffee managers who are chosen from the village community and who will receive a payment to begin a leaf rust control program in their own coffee gardens and serve as a nucleus to advise neighbouring farmers. The village coffee managers will be supervised by 220 district managers covering the major coffee producing areas. These in turn will be supervised by five assistant general managers. Regional managers are to be chosen from the existing provincial extension services and by general recruitment allied with training courses run by the authority. ",

As it happens, the splitting of extension from research — transferring extension responsibilities to the provincial governments — has led to a marked deterioration in the quality of extension services, as well as to a reduced flow of information from farmers back to researchers. This problem, which is discussed in more detail in McKillop, Williamson and Associates (1982), Kern et al. (1984) and Jarrett (1986), is also highlighted in a major review by the World Bank (1981). This review concluded that 'The operation of the extension services in the field left much to be desired. Many staff were engaged in a range of activities only marginally related to extension work, there were only a limited number of extension programs, and there was little supervision of extension activity.' It recommended the re-establishment of an Extension Division within the national Department of Agriculture and Livestock to provide regional support units to assist provincial extension officers, as well as the withdrawal of provincial extension officers from non-extension activities.

The pertinent question is whether the government should fund research and extension on traditional staples out of consolidated revenue.Carrad and Bourke (1985) believe more research on sweet potato, taro and sago is warranted. On the other hand, empirical work based on a model developed by Davis, Oram and Ryan (1987) suggests the retums from such research is likely to be much lower than from research on major crops. ",

Moreover, villagers themselves have not sought such research. A study of eight highland villages concluded that villagers in this survey had a very strong desire for cash. There was very litle interest in new subsistence crops to supplement their diets (Harris 1975). The same conclusion is reached by Kern et al. (1984) in studies in the provinces of Milne Bay, East New Britain, Southern Highlands and West Sepik, which indicated the same emphasis on the cash economy, markets and infrastructure. The Food and Agriculture Organization/United Nations Development Program (1983) commented that there appeared to be little political pressure coming from rural areas for resources to be devoted to food production.

Adam Smith drew attention to education as a profitable investment activity two centuries ago in his Wealth of Nations. More recently, T.W. Schultz was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for his work in highlighting the contribution that investments in the health and skills of people could make to economic development and poverty alleviation. He stressed in particular the importance of investing in rural people in developing economies such as Papua New Guinea's. He and his students have demonstrated clearly that education in rural areas makes two key contributions. First, it makes farmers more adept as managers adjusting to changes such as fluctuations in prices or the introduction of new farm technologies. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it improves rural people's capacity to cope with moving out of agriculture (see, for example, Welch 1970; Huffman 1974; Schultz 1971, 1975, 1980; Jamison and Lau 1981). Farmers who are better educated earn higher incomes because they are quicker and better at making use of new technologies and adjusting their input and output mixes to take advantage of changes in relative prices. In addition, those (usually younger) members of rural households who choose to seek a non-farm job — for example, because of a lack of farm land — tend to find work faster and eam a higher income the better their education. The latter point is especially important in Papua New Guinea's case because most of tomorrow's non-agricultural workers are the children in rural areas today. In addition, education makes a number of more subtle contributions, perhaps the most important being that children tend to be healthier and do better at school — and subsequently in the workforce — the more educated their parents, especially their mother. So even if women spend less time in the workforce outside the home than men, they contribute very significantly to the country's development through the environment they provide for their children, and more so the better educated they are (Psacharopoulos 1988; Psacharopoulos and Woodhall 1985).

These results are summarized in the age/earnings profiles shown in Figure 7.1. The intercepts on the vertical axis, which represent starting incomes, are higher the more education people have, and so too are the average slopes of the lines shown, which represent the rates of increase in people's incomes as they gain work experience. while similar data are not available for Papua New Guinea's non-wage earners, who dominate the rural sector, the very extensive empirical evidence from many other developing countries suggests the same pattem is likely to exist among them, and is likely to become more pronounced the more subsistence farmers become integrated into the cash economy and exposed to new production technologies and changing marketing opportunities (see, for example, the literature cited in Jamison and Laua 1981).

This alone might suggest Papua New Guinea is underinvesting in formal education, except that one needs to keep in mind that mass education in the country is a recent phenomenon. At present, the central government is spending a relatively large share of its budget on education compared with other developing countries. In 1986 that share was 17 per cent, but in earlier years since Independence it has been as high as 20 per cent (compared with 13 per cent in 1975). Since Papua New Guinea's central government accounts for a larger share of GNP than governments in most other developing countries, this means public expenditure on education as a percentage of national income in Papua New Guinea is high, in fact more than double that for developing countries as a whole (Table 7.1). It is unlikely that private expenditure on education in other developing countries is so much larger than in Papua New Guinea that it would offset this difference in public spending. ",

The annual cost per student of providing education in Papua New Guinea in 1983 was K150 at the primary level, K360 at the provincial high level and K730 at the vocational high school level. However, at the upper secondary level it was K2000, and at the university level K7900 per student. Moreover, thesecost differences between elementary and advanced education have widened considerably since 1973 (Table 7.4). Presently, the expenditure per student at the university level in Papua New Guinea is more than double that in Australia. This reflects the fact that the staff/student ratio in Papua New Guinea is more than double Australia's and that a larger proportion of students in Papua New Guinea have to live away from home for their advanced education and the government subsidizes their living costs as well as travel to their home villages during vacations. Yet, despite this high level of government support for advanced education, the output of first-degree graduates is depressingly small and that of higher-degree graduates is almost non-existent. In the context of staffing agricultural research agencies in Papua New Guinea, the International Service for National Agricultural Research (1982) predicted that, by the end of 1987, there would be a need for nine national scientists with Master's degrees for the research staff of the Department of Agriculture and Livestock, as well as twenty-two undertaking Master's programs and three in Ph.D. programs. Yet, in 1988, there was not a single national with a Master's degree working in agricultural research, there were six candidates undertaking Master's programs overseas and there were no Ph.D. candidates in training.

Far too often the hierarchical structure of national and provincial governments means that extension information passes from secretary to deputy to assistant secretary to director to deputy director before it finally reaches the district officer who has to interact with the farmer in a way that makes sense to the farmer concerned. In such circumstances, the district officers often feel disenchanted in the perfomance of their extension duties since they are a long way removed from the source of the knowledge they are disseminating.

Almost half of the central government's health expenditure is on hospitals, which is about twice the share in neighbouring countries of East and Southeast Asia (Richardson 1986). Given that most observers believe the weakest link in the delivery of health services is at the interface between the aid post and the village population, some reallocation of funds away from hospitals may be warranted. Goodman et al. (1985:167) suggest this could be accommodated by expanding the number of urban health centres so that they can provide (at considerably lower cost) those services which are currently the responsibility of overcrowded outpatient departments of hospitals. They also suggest, incidentally, that the government consider contracting more of the primary health services and the training of orderlies to the churches, who are able to provide those services at lower cost than public authorities.

The exporter of cash crops bears the full burden of these costs, since he cannot pass them on to his customers overseas. As was discussed in Chapter 3 with respect to wage costs in marketing agricultural exports, the higher transportation and handling costs the lower the price received by producers and the smaller the quantity they will export (see Figure 3.5). That is, transport costs are just like an export tax, except that they do not generate revenue for the government. For staple food crops sold in the villages and towns, the consumer shares the burden of the transport cost with the producer, but the larger that cost the worse off they both are and the smaller the volume and proportion of staple food that is marketed. For these reasons, reducing the cost of transportation to and from rural areas can have a major impact not only on.rural development (Howe and Richards 1985) but also on the retail price and availability of indigenous food in urban areas and hence on overall food self-sufficiency. It might be argued also that easing the cost of transport between urban centres and rural areas would encourage more outmigration of people from agriculture and so exacerbate urban unemployment problems. The latter does not necessarily follow from the fomer, however, since lower fares would also make it easier for migrants to retum to their village should they have difficulty obtaining a joborotherwisebecomedisenchantedwithurban life.

At present, Papua New Guinea has only about 19,000 kilometres of trafficable roads over its land area of almost half a million square kilometres. Only 6 per cent of these roads are sealed. They tend to be fairly evenly distributed on a per capita basis across provinces (Table 7.8). Apart from the Highlands Highway connecting Lae with Mt Hagen, the road network has developed essentially as extensions from roads in the larger towns, such as Port Moresby, Lae, Rabaul and Kieta, or as a result of upgrading patrol roads which were established in rural areas during the period of the Australian Administration to facilitate access to the more remote villages.

Unlike investments in agricultural research and education, investments in new roads immediately provide clearly visible signs of government activity and for that reason are attractive to politicians. Goodman et al. (1985), however, are fairly sanguine about increased investments in extending the road system. They cite engineering studies which show that none of the proposed new roads or road sections, including the road linking Port Moresby to Lae and a road from the Highlands to Madang on the north coast, would provide a sufficiently high return to warrant the investment. On the other hand, further investment in maintaining and upgrading the existing network may well yield a high return. However, activity is much less glamorous than new road construction and so has less political appeal, even though it would do much to reduce the cost of transporting goods to and from rural areas. ",

Of major concern to coffee growers is the increasing incidence of robberies on the Highlands Highway during the harvest season when buyers carry large amounts of cash.

Facilitating the erosion in real tems of artificially high urban wages would expand employment opportunities in both urban and rural areas. And streamlining the issuing and transferring of land titles would encourage the development and better utilization of both existing and new agricultural land. That is to say, there is ample scope to improve output simply by allowing existing resources to be used more efficiently through policy changes aimed at reducing distortions in the capital and labour markets and enhancing the efficiency of the land market.

In practice this means restricting imports less and allowing the kina to move towards, and remain closer to, its equilibrium value vis-a-vis other currencies. Simply converting all quantitative trade restrictions to explicit trade taxes would be a useful beginning, as it would generate extra trade tax revenue for the govemment. Then lowering the highest of those taxes would not only boost trade tax revenue even further (because the volume of imports would expand) but also would discourage production in the most protected and least competitive enterprises. A much more radical proposal is to replace all import restrictions with a uniform export tax and to impose consumption taxes on imported luxuries. The latter would be no more disadvantageous than the former from the viewpoint of export industries, and yet it would have a number of advantages from society's viewpoint. The most important of these are lower costs of administering trade restrictions and fewer opportunities for potential import-replacing producer interest groups to seek favours from the government. ",

Public investments have a habit of crowding out private investments in many instances, so the government need become involved only when gaps appear, and even then it is sometimes possible to intervene only minimally. A case in point is agricultural research. Governments, arguably, are no better than the private sector in undertaking such research. However, the government does have an important role in ensuring all producers, including smallholders, contribute towards funding such research. The free-rider problem can easily be overcome by making use of the existing export tax collection service to levy funds from producers. It would appear that more expenditure on agricultural research would yield a very high return, although perhaps more so for some products (particularly coffee, coconuts and cocoa) than others. ",
