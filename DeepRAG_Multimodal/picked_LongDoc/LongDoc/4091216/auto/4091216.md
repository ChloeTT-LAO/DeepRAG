Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) can damage the highly sensitive circuits in the instrument. ESD is most likely to occur as test devices are being connected to, or disconnected from, the instrument’s front and rear panel ports and connectors. You can protect the instrument and test devices by wearing a static-discharge wristband. Alternatively, you can ground yourself to discharge any static charge by touching the outer chassis of the grounded instrument before touching the instrument’s front and rear panel ports and connectors. Avoid touching the test port center conductors unless you are properly grounded and have eliminated the possibility of static discharge.  

Repair of damage that is found to be caused by electrostatic discharge is not covered under warranty.

# 1-7 Instrument Description  

The Spectrum Master is a synthesizer-based handheld spectrum analyzer that provides quick and accurate measurement results. Measurements can be easily made by using the main instrument functions: frequency, span, amplitude, and bandwidth. Dedicated keys for common functions and a familiar calculator-type keypad are available for fast data entry.  

Time and date stamping of measurement data is automatic. The internal memory provides for the storage and recall of up to 1000 measurement setups and up to 1000 traces using Master Software Tools (MST). External storage can be used for bulk measurement storage. The bright daylight-viewable, high-resolution, color liquid crystal display (LCD) provides easy viewing in a variety of lighting conditions. The Spectrum Master is capable of up to 2.5 hours of continuous operation from a fully charged battery and can be operated from a 12 VDC source, which also simultaneously charges the battery.  

The Spectrum Master is designed for monitoring, measuring, and analyzing signal environments. Typical measurements include: in-band interference and transmit spectrum analysis, plus cell site and $802.11\mathrm{a}/\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{g}$ interference testing. Options are available for RF, advanced demodulation, and over-the-air (OTA) measurement. A full range of marker capabilities (such as peak, center, and delta functions) are provided for faster, more comprehensive analysis of displayed signals. Upper and lower multi-segmented limit lines are available to create quick, simple pass/fail measurements. A menu option provides for an audible alert when a limit value is exceeded.  

In transmitter analyzer mode, the Spectrum Master displays six markers and the marker table in Code Domain Power and Codogram displays. In Spectrum Analyzer mode, a full range of marker capabilities is provided. Markers are not available in GSM mode.  

Anritsu Master Software Tools, a PC-based software program, provides for storing measurement data. Master Software Tools can also convert the Spectrum Master display into several graphic formats.  

Measurements may be stored in the internal memory or a USB flash drive. Stored measurements can be downloaded to a PC by using the included USB and Ethernet cables. After being stored, the graphic trace can then be displayed, scaled, or enhanced with markers and limit lines. Historical graphs can be overlaid with current data by using the PC mouse in drag-and-drop fashion. The underlying data can be extracted and used in spreadsheets or for other analytical tasks.

# 1-8 Spectrum Master Specifications  

Refer to the Technical Data Sheet listed in Section 1-1 for general specifications, detailed measurement specifications for all available measurement modes, ordering information, power sensors, and available accessories. The data sheet is included with the instrument and also available on the Anritsu web site: http://www.anritsu.com.  

# 1-9 Calibration Requirements  

The Spectrum Master loads factory calibration data during start-up, eliminating the need for daily calibration checks. In WCDMA modes, an additional automatic calibration is performed as the internal temperature of the Spectrum Master changes (to insure the best possible measurement results).  

Although the Spectrum Master does not require daily field calibration, Anritsu Company recommends annual calibration and performance verification by local Anritsu service centers.  

# 1-10 Preventive Maintenance  

Spectrum Master preventive maintenance consists of cleaning the unit and inspecting and cleaning the RF connectors on the instrument and on all accessories. Clean the Spectrum Master with a soft, lint-free cloth that is dampened with water or with water and a mild cleaning solution.  

Caution To avoid damage to the display or case, do not use solvents or abrasive cleaners.  

Clean the RF connectors and center pins with a cotton swab dampened with denatured alcohol. Visually inspect the connectors. The fingers of N(f) connectors and the pins of $\mathrm{{N}}(\mathrm{{m})}$ connectors should be unbroken and uniform in appearance. If you are unsure whether the connectors are good, then gauge the connectors to confirm that their dimensions are correct.  

Visually inspect test port cables. Test port cables should be uniform in appearance, not stretched, kinked, dented, or broken.  

# 1-11 ESD Cautions  

The $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ , like other high performance instruments, is susceptible to ESD (electrostatic discharge) damage. Coaxial cables and antennas often build up a static charge, which may damage the $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ input circuitry (if allowed to discharge by connecting directly to the $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ without previously discharging the static charge). $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ operators must be aware of the potential for ESD damage and take all necessary precautions.  

Operators should exercise practices outlined within industry standards such as JEDEC-625 (EIA-625), MIL-HDBK-263, and MIL-STD-1686, which pertain to ESD and ESDS devices, equipment, and practices. Because these apply to the $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ , Anritsu Company recommends that any static charges that may be present be dissipated before connecting coaxial cables or antennas to the $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ . This may be as simple as temporarily attaching a short or load device to the cable or antenna prior to attaching to the $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ . Remember that the operator may also carry a static charge that can cause damage. Following the practices outlined in the above standards ensures a safe environment for both personnel and equipment.

# 1-17 Secure-Environment Workplace  

This section describes the Option 7 and Frequency Blanking, types of memory in the Spectrum Master, how to delete stored user files in internal memory, and recommended usage in a secure-environment workplace.  

# Option 7, Secure Data  

Option 7, Secure Data will set the instrument to allow saving information to only an external USB flash drive. Saving to the internal memory is disabled. When Option 7 is installed, itis always On. It can be disabled only if a Service Center or other repair facility removes Option 7 from the instrument.  

Note that even with Option 7 enabled, operating parameters (such as frequency Caution range and power level) that are set by the user are stored in the Spectrum Master EEPROM when the Spectrum Master is turned OFF. These parameters can be erased, however, via a Master Reset operation, as described later in this chapter.  

# Frequency Blanking  

Option 7 allows the user to hide the displayed frequency values. Frequency values displayed on the screen and menus are replaced with ##.####. To enable frequency blanking press the Shift key, then the System (8) key. Press the System Options submenu key, then the Reset submenu key. Press the Frequency Blanking submenu key so that On is underlined. Setting Frequency Blanking back to Off will preset the instrument to factory default settings.  

After frequency blanking is enabled the user is not able to restore the frequency readouts. Following is a list of the security measures that have been taken to protect the frequency information after Frequency Blanking is turned on.  

1. Turning off frequency blanking presets the instrument (and the frequencies) to the factory default settings.   
2. Turning off the instrument presets the instrument to the factory default settings and turns off frequency blanking.   
3. Presetting the instrument turns off frequency blanking and restores the factory default settings.   
4. Frequency blanking is available only with Option 7 to ensure that user files and calibration files are not stored in the internal memory of the instrument.  

# Warning  

Note that when Frequency Blanking is turned on user files can still be stored and saved to an external USB drive, and that frequency information is not blanked in those files. Also, frequency information is not blanked from the SCPI commands that are used to remotely control the instrument.  

# Spectrum Master Memory Types  

The instrument contains non-volatile disk-on-a-chip memory, EEPROM, and volatile DRAM memory. The instrument does not have a hard disk drive or any other type of volatile or non-volatile memory.  

# EEPROM  

This memory stores the model number, serial number, and calibration data for the instrument. Also stored here are the user-set operating parameters, such as frequency range. During the master reset process, all operating parameters that are stored in the EEPROM are set to standard factory default values.  

# RAM Memory  

This is volatile memory that is used to store parameters that are needed for the normal operation of the instrument along with current measurements. This memory is reset whenever the instrument is restarted.  

# External USB Flash Drive (not included with the instrument)  

This memory may be selected as the destination for saved measurements and setups for the instrument. You can also copy the contents of the internal disk-on-chip memory to the external flash memory for storage or data transfer. The external Flash USB can be reformatted or sanitized using software on a PC.  

Refer to the Chapter 4, “File Management” for additional information about saving and copying files to the USB flash drive.

# 2-10 Connector Care  

Visually inspect connectors for general wear, for cleanliness, and for damage such as bent pins or connector rings. Repair or replace damaged connectors immediately. Dirty connectors can limit the accuracy of your measurements. Damaged connectors can damage the instrument. Connection of cables carrying an electrostatic potential, excess power, or excess voltage can damage the connector or the instrument or both. Connection of cables with inadequate torque settings can affect measurement accuracy. Over torquing connectors can damage the cable, the connector, the instrument, or all of these items.  

# Connecting Procedure  

1. Carefully align the connectors.  

The male connector center pin must slip concentrically into the contact fingers of the female connector.  

2. Push connectors straight together. Do not twist or screw them together.  

3. To tighten, turn the connector nut, not the connector body. Major damage can occur to the center conductor and to the outer conductor if the connector body is twisted.  

4. If you use a torque wrench, then initially tighten by hand so that approximately 1/8 turn or 45 degrees of rotation remains for the final tightening with the torque wrench.  

Relieve any side pressure on the connection (such as from long or heavy cables) in order to assure consistent torque.  Use an open-end wrench to keep the connector body from turning while tightening with the torque wrench.  

Do not over torque the connector.  

# Disconnecting Procedure  

1. If a wrench is needed, then use an open-end wrench to keep the connector body from turning while loosening with a second wrench.  

2. Complete the disconnection by hand, turning only the connector nut.  

3. Pull the connectors straight apart without twisting or bending.

# Chapter 3 — Quick Start Guide  

# 3-1 Introduction  

This chapter provides a brief overview of the Anritsu $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ Spectrum Master. The intent of this chapter is to provide a starting point for making basic measurement setups. This chapter describes setup, configure frequency, bandwidth, and amplitude before configuring your measurement setups. After measurements are taken, refer to section “Managing Files” on page 4-1 for a description of saving, recalling, and deleting measurement files. For more detailed information about specific measurements, refer to the measurement descriptions in the measurement guides for the specific instrument mode and analyzer technology (such as Spectrum Analyzer, WiMAX, or 3GPP). Refer to Appendix A, “Measurement Guides”, for a list of these measurement guides and their Anritsu part numbers.  

The Spectrum Analyzer Measurement Guide includes sections that describe resolution bandwidth, video bandwidth, sweep, and attenuator functions. For example, in the Spectrum Master, Resolution Bandwidth is determined by the intermediate frequency (IF) filter bandwidth. The spectrum analyzer traces the shape of the IF filter as it tunes past a signal. If more than one IF filter is used in a spectrum analyzer, then the narrowest one dominates and is considered the resolution bandwidth. Figure 3-1 is an example of a spectrogram display.

Figure 6-2. GPS Icon, Green  

# Note  

As long as 3 minutes may be required for the Ref Freq status to change to GPS High Accuracy in the Status menu, which is displayed on the left side of the measurement display.   
To reset the GPS, press the Reset submenu key. The green GPS icon with a red cross appears when GPS satellite tracking is lost (refer to Figure 6-3). This occurs after being active (tracking three or more satellites).  

![](images/3a1c4ee63f8d43ab4b9db1d7f7e754a2c77d80c8c70c8213a7f5d991d75eebaa.jpg)  
Figure 6-3. GPS Icon, Green with Red Cross  

After GPS location Fix is attained, the internal reference oscillator begins to correct its frequency to match the GPS standard. After the internal frequency is adjusted to match the GPS standard, the status is indicated by “GPS High Accuracy” showing in the Status menu, which is displayed on the left side of the measurement display. When the GPS feature is not enabled, the reference source displays either “Internal Standard Accuracy” or a user-selected external reference frequency in the Status menu.  

Within three minutes of satellite acquisition, the reference oscillator will have an accuracy of better than 25 ppb (parts per billion). The OCXO internal standard accuracy is $\pm0.3$ PPM. The correction factor applied to the internal OCXO allows the instrument to maintain GPS frequency accuracy for three days at better than $50\mathrm{ppb}$ , even when the instrument is obstructed from receiving signals from the GPS satellites.  

In order to acquire data from the GPS satellites, you must have line-of-sight to the satellites, or the antenna must be placed outside with no obstructions.  

Option 31 requires a GPS antenna, Anritsu part number 2000-1528-R.  

# Chapter 7 — Master Software Tools  

# 7-1 Introduction  

This chapter provides a brief overview of Master Software Tools (MST), firmware update, and emergency repair procedures. For detailed information about Master Software Tools, refer to the MST Manual on the CD-ROM that was included with the Spectrum Master. The major sections of this chapter include:

Mixer Saturation:  Increase Attenuation  

or  

# Mixer Overdrive FAILED  

Too much power applied with too little Attenuation. Increase attenuation. Sometimes even out of band frequencies may be present that would cause a Mixer Overdrive Error. In highly rich RF environments it may be necessary to add an external band pass filter to reduce unwanted interference. See the accessories section for a list available band pass filters from Anritsu. Out of band frequencies can often be detected by increasing the SPAN to maximum in peak detect mode of operation. Another resolution may be to Reset to factory defaults with either Factory Defaults, $\mathrm{ESC+ON}$ , or MASTER RESET, System $+0\mathrm{N}$ . Caution: Use of MASTER RESET, System $+\mathrm{ON}$ , will erase all user saved setups and measurement traces and return the unit to a fully Factory Default condition. If the error persists, then contact your Anritsu Service Center.  

# B-3 Operation Error Messages  

ADC Over range: Increase Reference Level  

Input signal is too large for the Analog to Digital converter to process. Increase the internal or external attenuation or, if using Auto attenuation, then increasing the Reference Level should resolve the error. See also the “Mixer Overdrive FAILED” error (described previously) for information on Out of Band RF power.  

# Calibrator Reading Error  

Calibration reference source is not providing quality signal. Insure that the battery level is adequate for operation or that temperature is within acceptable limits. Reset to factory defaults with either Factory Defaults, $\mathrm{ESC+ON}$ , or MASTER RESET, System $+0\mathrm{N}$ .  

Caution: Use of MASTER RESET, System $+0\mathrm{N}$ , will erase all user saved setups and measurement traces and return the unit to a fully Factory Default condition. If the error persists, then contact your Anritsu Service Center.  

Fatal Error

Fan Failure  

The system has determined that the fan should be running due to the internal temperature of the unit, but cannot detect that the fan is actually running.  

It is important to keep the fan inlet and exhaust ports clear of obstructions. The cooling fan will vary the speed in relation to the internal temperature of the instrument. The fan will turn on at low speed when the internal temperature of the instrument reaches $44^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and will increase the fan speed to maximum at $54^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . As the internal temperature of the instrument decreases, the fan will reduce speed until the temperature reaches $39^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , at which point the fan will turn off.

Figure B-1. Fan Speed versus Temperature  

# High Temp Warning  

The internal temperature has reached an excessive level, $85^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Verify that the ventilation openings are unobstructed and that the fan is running. Internal temperatures may be manually verified by using the SELF TEST function. Turn off the unit and allow the temperature to cool down. If the fault is not resolved and if the internal temperature reaches $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , then a countdown of 10 seconds will begin to give the user a chance to save the current setup before it will turn itself off (before internal temperatures can cause any damage). If the error persists after removing any obstructions and allowing the unit to cool, then reset to the factory defaults with either Factory Defaults, $\mathrm{ESC+ON}$ . Caution: Use of MASTER RESET, System $+{\mathrm{ON}}$ , will erase all user saved setups and measurement traces and return the unit to a fully Factory Default condition. If the error persists, then contact your Anritsu Service Center.  

# Copy failed. Please check External USB Memory

Trace not saved. Please wait for complete sweep and try again.  

Attempted to save a measurement trace before the sweep had completed at least once. Wait for at least one complete sweep and try to save again.  

# Appendix C — LAN and DHCP  

# C-1 Introduction  

This appendix describes network connections for the MS272xC Spectrum Master.  

# C-2 Ethernet Configuration  

# LAN Connection  

The RJ-45 connector is used to connect the Spectrum Master to a local area network. Integrated into this connector are two LEDs. The amber LED shows the presence of a 10 Mbit/s LAN connection when on, and a 100 Mbit/s LAN connection when off. The green LED flashes to show that LAN traffic is present. The instrument IP address is set by pressing the Shift key, then the System (8) key followed by the System Options submenu key and the Ethernet Config submenu key. The instrument Ethernet address can be set automatically using DHCP, or manually by entering the desired IP address, gateway address, and subnet mask.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Note</td><td>An active Ethernet cable must be connected to the instrument before it is turned ON in order to enable the Ethernet port for DHCP or for a static IP address. Depending upon local conditions, the port may remain enabled when changing from DHCP to static IP address, when changing from static IP address to DHCP, or when temporarily disconnecting the Ethernet cable. If the port becomes disabled, then ensure that an active Ethernet cable is attached</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an Internet protocol that automates the process of setting IP addresses for devices that use TCP/IP, and is the most common method of configuring a device for network use. To determine if a network is set up for DHCP, connect the $\mathrm{MS272xC}$ to the network and select DHCP protocol in the Ethernet Config menu.  

Turn the Spectrum Master off, and then on. If the network is set up for DHCP, then the assigned IP address should be displayed briefly after the power up sequence.  

To display the IP address with the instrument on, press the Shift key, then the System (8) key, then the System Options submenu key and the Ethernet Config submenu key. The IP address will be displayed as shown in Figure C-1. The image on the display panel of your Spectrum Master may differ from the image shown here.

# C-3 DHCP  

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol that allows a server to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices that are connected to the network. Most networks include a DHCP server to manage IP addresses. When a DHCP server is available on the network, DHCP is the preferred IP address assignment mode.  

When using DHCP, no setup is required to lease and use a dynamic IP address. In a dynamic IP operation, the IP address in use may change from use to use. The DHCP server hands out IP addresses on a first come, first served basis. As soon as the device is disconnected from the network, the IP address that it was using becomes available to lease to the next unit that requests an IP address. Normally, some amount of lag time is present on the DHCP server end, so if the device is connected again reasonably soon, then it may end up with the same address.  

When a DHCP server is not available, a Static IP address can be used. A Static IP address is a fixed address. After being set, it will always remain the same, and care must be taken to not conflict with other equipment on the network.  

When using a static IP address on an established network, always request the Static IP address from the network administrator. Randomly choosing a Static IP address on an established network may result in duplicate IP addresses or other conflicts.  

Three parameters must be set prior to using a Static IP address:  

# IP Address  

This is the Static IP address on the network.  

# Default Gateway  

Often when a static IP address is assigned, a default gateway is also identified. If the default gateway is unknown, then type in the Static IP address so that the Static IP address and Default Gateway are the same number.  

# Subnet Mask  

This parameter is usually extracted from the Static IP address based on the class of the address and determines the destination of any broadcast messages that might be sent from the instrument. It can be customized if necessary. The subnet mask may also be provided with the Static IP address.  

# Example 1  

In this example, a Static IP address has been chosen because no network DHCP service is available. The instrument is connected to the network port on the PC with a crossover Ethernet cable (not included). This is also referred to as Direct Connect:  

IP Address: 10.0.0.2   
Default Gateway: 10.0.0.2   
Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0  

# Example 2  

In this example, the Static IP address has been assigned with an associated gateway and subnet mask:  

IP Address: 153.56.100.42   
Default Gateway: 153.56.100.1   
Subnet Mask: 255.255.252.0  

# C-4 ipconfig Tool  

A few tools that are built into the Microsoft Windows operating system can assist in making some determinations about the network to which the PC is connected. Typing ipconfig at a command prompt produces a display of information about the in-use parameters of the PC and its network connection. Following is an example of the typical results expected:  

The ipconfig display does not report whether the information is from a DHCP Note server or from a Static IP setup.

# C-5 Ping Tool  

Another tool that can find out if a selected IP address is already on the network is ping. Ping is a harmless way to determine if an address is found on the network, and (if it is found) to receive a reply. Basically, the ping function sends out a request to a specific address to determine if a computing device is connected to the network at that address. If a valid connection is found, then a copy of the signal (that was sent) is returned. If a connection is not found, then the response is “request timed out”, which means that no reply was received from that IP address.
