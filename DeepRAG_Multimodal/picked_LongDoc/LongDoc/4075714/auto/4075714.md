# From Here to There: Alec Soth’s America Edited by Siri Engberg. Interview by Bartholomew Ryan. Text by Geoff Dyer, Barry Schwabsky, Britt Salvesen, Siri Engberg, August Kleinzahler.  

Great pictures are all about luck, and anyone can take a great picture. But very, very few people can put together a great collection of pictures. It is incredibly difficult to put these fragments together in a meaningful way. But that is my goal.  

From Here to There: Alec Soth’s America is the first exhibition catalogue to feature the full spectrum of the work of Alec Soth, one of the most interesting voices in contemporary photography, whose compelling images of everyday America form powerful narrative vignettes. Featuring more than 100 of the artist’s photographs made over the past 15 years, the book includes new critical essays by exhibition curator Siri Engberg, curator and art historian Britt Salvesen and critic Barry Schwabsky, which offer context on the artist’s working process, the photo-historical tradition behind his practice and reflections on his latest series of works. Novelist Geoff Dyer’s “Riverrun”—a meditation on Soth’s series Sleeping by the Mississippi—and August Kleinzahler’s poem “Sleeping It Off in Rapid City” contribute to the thoughtful exploration of this body of work. Also included in the publication is a 48-page artist’s book by Soth titled The Loneliest Man in Missouri, a photographic essay with short, diaristic texts capturing the banality and ennui of middle America’s suburban fringes, with their corporate office parks, strip clubs and chain restaurants. This full-color publication includes a complete exhibition history, bibliography and interview with the artist by Bartholomew Ryan. Alec Soth was born in 1969 and raised in Minnesota, where he continues to live and work. He has received fellowships from the McKnight Foundation (1999, 2004) and Jerome Foundation (2001), was the recipient of the 2003 Santa Fe Prize for Photography and was short-listed for the highly prestigious Deutsche Börse Photography Prize. His first monograph, Sleeping by the Mississippi, was published by Steidl in 2004 to critical acclaim. Since then Soth has published Niagara (2006), Fashion Magazine (2007), Dog Days, Bogotá (2007) and The Last Days of W (2008). He is a member of Magnum Photos.

# William Christenberry: Kodachromes Text by Richard B. Woodward.  

Never-beforeseen   
Kodachromes from American master   
photographer William   
Christenberry.  

Although best known for his large-format color photographs made with vintage Kodak Brownie cameras, William Christenberry has also consistently produced work with $35~\mathsf{m m}$ Kodachrome slide film since he took up photography. William Christenberry: Kodachromes is the first publication to showcase this stunning and previously unknown body of work, spanning from 19 $64$ to 2007, of which only a small number of images have ever been published or exhibited. As in all of Christenberry’s photographs, the subject matter is the rural Deep South: the twisting back roads, open landscapes, rusted signage and ramshackle vernacular architecture found in Hale County, Alabama. Though many of the sites pictured in this rare collection are new, other subjects have grown iconic in Christenberry’s oeuvre as he has returned to photograph them over the decades—the red building in the forest, Sprott Church, the Palmist Sign and the Bar-B-Q Inn, among others. The photographs in William Christenberry: Kodachromes were made with a camera that allowed for greater mobility, revealing new ways of considering Christenberry’s perennial subjects and offering further insight into the working method of this venerable artist. William Christenberry (born 1936) has been a professor at the Corcoran College of Art and Design, Washington, D.C., since 1968. His work has been the subject of dozens of solo shows and exhibitions over the last 40 years, and can be found in numerous permanent collections, including those of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, $\mathsf{D.C.},$ The Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum of American Art, both in New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and Center for Creative Photography, Tucson. His work was the subject of a major year-long solo exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2006.

# Richard Misrach: Destroy This Memory  

The photographs in Richard Misrach’s Destroy This Memory are a stark, affecting reminder of the physical and psychological impact of Hurricane Katrina as told by those on the ground, and seen through the lens of a contemporary master. Rather than simply surveying the damage, Misrach—who has photographed the region regularly since the 1970s, most notably for his ongoing Cancer Alley project—found himself drawn to the hurricane-inspired graffiti: messages scrawled in spray paint, crayons, chalk or whatever materials residents and rescue workers happened to have on hand. At turns threatening, desperate, clinical and even darkly humorous, the phrases he captures—the only text that appears in the book—offer revealing and unique human perspectives on the devastation and shock left in the wake of this disaster. Destroy This Memory presents previously unpublished and starkly compelling material, all of which Misrach shot with his ${}_{4}M{\mathsf{P}}$ pocket camera while also working on a separate archive of over 1,000 photographs with his $^{8\times}$ 10 large-format camera. Created between October and December 2005, this series of images serves as a potent, unalloyed document of the raw experiences of those left to fend for themselves in the aftermath of Katrina. With no essay, titles or even page numbers in the way, the words on these homes, cars and trees offer a searing testament that continues to speak volumes, five years after their original inscription.  

The graffiti of the desperate and the dispossessed: Richard Misrach’s photo-portrait of the words written by the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  

Richard Misrach (born 1949) is credited with helping to pioneer the renaissance of color photography and largescale presentation in the 1970s. He has exhibited extensively, and his work is held in the permanent collections of prestigious institutions such as The Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, $\mathsf{D.C.},$ Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and Art Institute of Chicago.

# METROPOLIS BOOKS  

This book brings together the strongest contemporary graphic design currently promoting sustainability and the fight against climate change. Collectively, essays by Michael Beirut, Steven Heller, Edward Morris and Dmitri Siegel look back in time to posters and ideas that set the stage for the current movement (World War Two posters, images of international cooperation, posters from the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s) and address the “state of the poster”: what is the efficacy and mode of distribution for purposeful, message-oriented graphic images today? Thomas L. Friedman advocates for “a redefined, broader and more muscular green ideology that can be the basis of a new unifying political movement for the twenty-first century.” The bulk of the book is given over to a compilation of the best posters on the theme of sustainability by a variety of contemporary artists (both emerging and established), among them Shepard Fairey, Michael Beirut, DJ Spooky, James Victore and Geoff McFetridge. These posters, which have a strong graphic presence and which never rest on the tired slogans of the past (“Save the Earth,” etc.), show that graphic design does not passively respond to the zeitgeist—it helps shape it. The book, which is sustainably printed in the U.S., reproduces 50 of these posters as tear-outs. Also included is a section on action, with documentation of designs at work in the world: on buses, billboards, protesters’ placards, graffiti, t-shirts and so on. This movement is about a new form of patriotism, one that exhibits pride of place, but not fear of others.  

D.A.P. is pleased to welcome Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum to its list. Cooper-Hewitt is the only American museum whose collection is focused solely on contemporary and historic design. Its publications are noted for their scholarly rigor, curatorial adventurousness, design excellence and wealth of visual materials.

# Why Design Now? National Design Triennial Text by Ellen Lupton, Cara McCarty, Matilda McQuaid, Cynthia Smith  

Why design now? As issues of ecology and sustainable living continue to gain in urgency and topicality, design has come to the forefront of the arts as the discipline best equipped to meet today’s challenges. Designers around the world are rising to this clarion call by creating products, buildings, landscapes, messages and more that address important social and ecological problems. Why Design Now? National Design Triennial accompanies the fourth installation in Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum’s acclaimed National Design Triennial exhibition series. Designed by Michael Bierut, a partner in the award-winning design firm Pentagram, Why Design Now? is the first Triennial book to be truly international in reach, with 134 designers and projects in more than 44 countries. With eight essays by four Cooper-Hewitt curators, project profiles and more than 350 color illustrations, many of which have never been published before, Why Design Now? offers a glimpse into contemporary innovation, and an up-to-the-minute survey of what progressive designers, engineers, entrepreneurs and citizens are doing in diverse fields and at different scales. Many of the featured works have influenced other designers by proposing new methodologies or by pioneering new techniques; also included are practical solutions already being implemented as well as experimental ideas designed to inspire further research. Each of the selected works—from a soil-powered table lamp to a post-petroleum urban utopia—celebrates the transformative power of design.

# Small Scale, Big Change New Architectures of Social Engagement Introduction by Barry Bergdoll. Text by Andres Lepik.  

The role of the global architect in society is changing. Instead of waiting for commissions to come their way, architects are initiating and developing practical solutions in response to dramatically changing living conditions in many parts of the world today. Small Scale, Big Change focuses on a central chapter of this shift, presenting recently built or under-construction works in underserved communities around the globe by these 11 architects and firms: Elemental (Chilean); Anna Heringer (Austrian); Diébédo Francis Kéré (Burkinabé); Hashim Sarkis A.L.U.D. (Lebanese); Jorge Mario Jáuregui (Brazilian); Frédéric Druot, Anne Lacaton & Jean Philippe Vassal (French); Michael Maltzan Architecture (American); Noero Wolff Architects (South African); Rural Studio (American); Estudio Teddy Cruz (American, born Guatemala); and Urban Think Tank (American/Austrian/Venezuelan). Without sacrificing concern for aesthetics, these architects have developed projects that reveal a post-utopian specificity of place; their architectural solutions emerge from close collaboration with future users and sustained research into local conditions. The projects—which include schools, parks, housing and infrastructural interventions—reveal an exciting change in the longstanding dialogue between architecture and society, as the architect’s roles, methods, approaches and responsibilities are dramatically reevaluated. They also offer an expanded definition of sustainability that moves beyond experimentation with new materials and technologies to encompass larger concepts of social and economic sustainability. Small Scale, Big Change examines the evolving standards of responsibility and participation in architecture and the ways in which architects can engage critically with larger social, economic and political issues currently facing communities around the world.

# The Power of Pro Bono 40 Stories About Design for the Public Good by Architects and Their Clients Edited by John Cary, Public Architecture. Foreword by Majora Carter. Preface by John Peterson.  

A first-of-its-kind book, equally representing the voices of architects and their clients, The Power of Pro Bono presents 40 pro bono design projects across the country. The clients include grassroots community organizations like the Homeless Prenatal Program of San Francisco, as well as national and international nonprofits, among them Goodwill, Habitat for Humanity, KIPP Schools and Planned Parenthood. These public-interest projects were designed by a range of award-winning practices, from SHoP Architects in New York and Studio Gang in Chicago, to young studios including Stephen Dalton Architects in Southern California and Hathorne Architects in Detroit, to some of the largest firms in the country, such as Gensler, HOK and Perkins $^+$ Will. Scores of private donors, local community foundations and companies, and material and service donations made these projects possible. So have some of the most progressive funders in the country, ranging from Brad Pitt’s Make It Right Foundation in New Orleans to the Robin Hood Foundation in New York. Taken as a whole, the selected works represent six general categories: Arts, Civic, Community, Education, Health and Housing. This book is inspired and informed by the advocacy and design work of Public Architecture, a national nonprofit founded in 2002 by San Francisco-based architect John Peterson. The 1% program of Public Architecture challenges architecture and design firms nationwide to pledge a minimum of one percent of their time to pro bono service, leveraging in excess of \$25 million in donated services annually.

# Tools for Living A Sourcebook of Iconic Designs for the Home Edited and with text by Charlotte Fiell, Peter Fiell.  

Tools for Living is a book about excellence in domestic design—from chef knives and pots and pans, to door handles and bathroom taps, to home-office furniture and garden tools. Well-designed objects not only offer superior performance but also look better and last longer, which ultimately means that they are more sustainable and provide better value for money. They also give the user a satisfying sense of reliability—they are the household tools that we use on a daily basis, that we come to grow fond of, tools that enhance life. Among the design classics celebrated here are Tapio Wirkkala’s Kurve cutlery (1963), Enzo Mari’s Formosa perpetual wall and desk calendars $(1963,1967),$ Björn Dahlström’s Tools cookware (1998) and Ross Lovegrove’s Agaricon table light (2001) and Istanbul sanitary ware (2008). Many of the objects included in Tools for Living are famous design classics that remain in production today. This comprehensive sourcebook features these objects in full-color illustrations that are augmented with full descriptions of their historic relevance and design excellence. Manufacturers’ web addresses are shown for each product, so that readers can easily locate where to buy them.

# Landmarks of Chair Design An All-New Survey by Charlotte and Peter Fiell Edited and with text by Charlotte Fiell, Peter Fiell.

Is there any item of furniture more conducive to endless reinvention, more expressive of an infinite array of design sensibilities, than the chair? From Shaker and Mission styles to the innovations of Charles and Ray Eames, the chair has always represented the paramount incarnation of practical design in everyday life, and a distinctive chair design still has the power to entirely alter the feel and look of a space. This all-new survey of innovative seating designs, compiled by Charlotte and Peter Fiell, renowned authorities on the subject, showcases over 1,000 chairs by some of the world’s greatest designers, from Alvar Aalto to Marco Zanuso. Here you’ll find such outstanding furniture as a woven cane indoor/outdoor chair made by British designer Harry Peach circa 1913, the slats of its sides sloping gracefully as the frame of a harp; the red Baker sofa, designed by Finn Juhl in 1951, with the upper portion of its backrest seeming to hover in the air; and the NV-53 sofa and chairs, which showcased the marvelous flowing lines Danish craftsmen coaxed from teak. Each image in Landmarks of Chair Design is accompanied by a concise descriptive text outlining the item’s design and historical context and an introductory essay details the main styles and developments that have occurred in seating design over the past 200 years. Furniture collectors, design lovers, fans and proprietors of design and furniture shops, interior architects and anybody who appreciates a chair that stands out from the crowd will all find this volume an indispensable resource.

# HATJE CANTZ  

# Jean-Michel Basquiat Text by Dieter Buchhart, Glenn O’Brien, Jean-Louis Prat, Susanne Reichling.  

The first African-American artist to attain art superstardom, Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960–1988) created a huge oeuvre of drawings and paintings (Julian Schnabel recalls him once accidentally leaving a portfolio of “about 2,000 drawings” on a subway car) in the space of just eight years. Through his street roots in graffiti, Basquiat helped to establish new possibilities for figurative and expressionistic painting, breaking the white male stranglehold of Conceptual and Minimal art, and foreshadowing, among other tendencies, Germany’s Junge Wilde movement. It was not only Basquiat’s art but also the details of his biography that made his name legendary—his early years as “Samo” (his graffiti artist moniker), his friendships with Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Madonna and his tragically early death from a heroin overdose. This superbly produced retrospective publication assesses Basquiat’s luminous career with commentary by, among others, Glenn O’Brien, and 160 color reproductions of the work. Jean-Michel Basquiat was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Puerto Rican mother and a Haitian father—an ethnic mix that meant young Jean-Michel was fluent in French, Spanish and English by the age of 11. In 1977, at the age of 17, Basquiat took up graffiti, inscribing the landscape of downtown Manhattan with his signature “Samo.” In 1980 he was included in the landmark group exhibition The Times Square Show; the following year, at the age of 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist ever to be invited to Documenta. By 1982, Basquiat had befriended Andy Warhol, later collaborating with him; Basquiat was much affected by Warhol’s death in 1987. He died of a heroin overdose on August 22, 1988, at the age of 27.

Picasso arrived at primitive art in order to give of its nobility to western art. And I arrived at Picasso to give his nobility to the art called “primitive.” —Jean-Michel Basquiat

# HATJE CANTZ  

When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the artist Neo Rauch was 30 years old, living in his East German hometown of Leipzig and just beginning to exhibit his paintings. It was the perfect moment for a painter who had been reared on Social Realism to gain access to art outside East Germany, to receive its influences into his art and to emerge onto the stage of world art as a star. At first closely identified with the generation of painters known as the Leipzig School, in recent years Rauch’s wonderfully bizarre blend of Social Realism (not exactly a widelymined style in contemporary art) with de Chirico or Stanley Spencer has come to be seen as a painterly barometer of post-Communist Europe. “Post-Communist Surrealism” could therefore be one way to describe the look of his canvases, which convey narrative intent— men and women from various historical eras performing obscure tasks in uniform, or midway through some ominous occasion—shifting styles several times within the same picture, but always displaying a lush brushwork. Rauch has established a particularly strong audience in the U.S., having been championed by The New York Times’ Roberta Smith as the painter of the zeitgeist. Marking Rauch’s fiftieth birthday and a simultaneous retrospective in Leipzig and Munich featuring works dating from 1982 to early 2010, this monograph is the most substantial appraisal of his work published to date. In it, his friends and colleagues supply testimonies, among them Luc Tuymans, Jonathan Meese and Michaël Borremans. Alongside essays by critics and historians, Timm Rautert provides a photographic portrait of Rauch’s studio.

I approach the phenomena of this world by letting things go through me in a nonhierarchical order, and then putting together private, very personal mosaics from the filtered material. In the best case, this leads to patterns being created that point to something above and beyond what people generally attribute to things. —Neo Rauch

# On Line Drawing Through the Twentieth Century Edited by Catherine de Zegher, Cornelia H. Butler.  

On Line: Drawing Through the Twentieth Century explores the radical evolution of drawing that took place during the last century and through to the present day, as numerous artists subjected the traditional concepts of the medium to a critical examination. In a revolutionary departure from the institutional definition of drawing, and from reliance on paper as the fundamental support material, artists instead pushed the line across the plane and into real space, expanding the medium in relation to gesture and form and connecting it with painting, sculpture, photography, film and dance. Published to accompany an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, On Line presents a discursive history of mark-making through nearly 250 works by 100 artists, including Aleksandr Rodchenko, Alexander Calder, Karel Malich, Eva Hesse, Anna Maria Maiolino, Richard Tuttle, Mona Hatoum and Monika Grzymala among many others. Essays by the curators illuminate individual practices and offer focused examinations of broader themes, such as the exploration of line by the avant-garde, and the relationship between drawing and dance.

# The Original Copy: Photography of Sculpture, $1839$ to Today Edited by Roxana Marcoci. Text by Roxana Marcoci, Geoffrey Batchen, Tobia Bezzola.  

Since its birth in the first half of the nineteenth century, photography has offered extraordinary possibilities of documenting, redefining and disseminating works of art. Through crop, focus, angle of view, degree of close-up and lighting, as well as through expostfacto techniques of dark room manipulation, collage, montage and assemblage, artists not only interpret the works they record but create stunning reinventions of them. The Original Copy: Photography of Sculpture, 1839 to Today presents a critical examination of the intersections between photography and sculpture, exploring how the one medium has become implicated in the understanding of the other. Through a selection of nearly 300 outstanding pictures by more than 100 artists from the nineteenth century to the present, The Original Copy looks at how and why sculpture became a photographic subject and how photography at once informs and challenges our knowledge of sculpture. The images range in subject from inanimate objects to performing bodies, and include major works by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Eugène Atget, Herbert Bayer, Hans Bellmer, Constantin Brancusi, Brassaï, Claude Cahun, Ken Domon, Marcel Duchamp, Fischli/Weiss, Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, David Goldblatt, Rachel Harrison, Hannah Höch, André Kertész, Louise Lawler, Man Ray, Bruce Nauman, Charles Nègre, David Smith, Alina Szapocznikow, Gillian Wearing, Hannah Wilke and Iwao Yamawaki, among others.

Chaos and Classicism: Art in France, Italy, and Germany, 1918–1936 explores the classicizing aesthetic that followed the immense destruction of World War I. Accompanying the Guggenheim’s exhibition of the same name, it examines the interwar period in its key artistic manifestations and their interpretations of classical values and aesthetics: the poetic dream of antiquity in the Parisian avant garde of Fernand Léger and Pablo Picasso; the politicized revival of the Roman Empire under Benito Mussolini by artists such as Giorgio de Chirico and Mario Sironi; and the austere functionalist utopianism of the Bauhaus, as well as, more chillingly, the pseudo-biological classicism, or Aryanism, of nascent Nazi society. This presentation of the seismic transformations in interbellum French, Italian and German culture encompasses painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, film, fashion and the decorative arts. Among the other artists surveyed here are Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, André Derain, Gino Severini, Jean Cocteau, Le Corbusier, Amédée Ozenfant, Madeleine Vionnet, Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Carlo Carrà, Giorgio Morandi, Massimo Campigli, Achille Funi, Ubaldo Oppi, Felice Casorati, Giuseppe Terragni, Gio Ponti, Arturo Martini, Georg Kolbe, Oskar Schlemmer, Otto Dix, Georg Scholz, Georg Schrimpf, Wilhelm Schnarrenberger and August Sander.

# Kirchner Edited by Felix Krämer. Text by Javier Arnaldo, Max Hollein, Sandra Oppmann, et al.  

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner painted city life as a joyous, bustling pageant, a sophisticated swirl of desiring bodies and colorful urbanity, giving Germany an energetic iconography for the glory days of modernity. One of the four founders of Die Brücke (The Bridge), Kirchner drew on German Renaissance art to conjure expressive exaggerations of face and posture, and brought to landscape painting a citydweller’s zest, imbuing tranquil scenery with riotous energy. Coinciding with a Kirchner retrospective at the Städel Museum—the first to be seen in Germany in 30 years— this massive volume surveys the artist’s several creative phases and genres. It features the famous nudes made during the Die Brücke era, his classic scenes of frenetic Berlin city life and Swiss mountainscapes from Davos, along with lesser-known canvases, works on paper and sculpture. With essays by renowned art historians, this definitive monograph offers fresh perspective on the continued relevance of Kirchner.  

# Rudolf Steiner and Contemporary Art Edited by Markus Brüderlin, Ulrike Groos.  

Born in Bavaria, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880–1938) studied architecture in Dresden, where he met the young painter Fritz Beyl. With Beyl, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff and Erich Heckel, Kirchner founded the group known as Die Brücke. Casting aside the then-prevalent academic style of painting, Kirchner and his friends allied themselves with early Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Matthias Grünewald and Cranach the Elder, and revived older media such as woodcut printing. Kirchner briefly saw army service in the First World War, but suffered a nervous breakdown and was discharged. In the interbellum years Kirchner’s reputation grew enormously, until the Nazi regime branded his art degenerate: in 1937 over 600 of his works were sold or destroyed. In 1938, despairing of this destruction and the general political climate, Kirchner committed suicide.  

At once a philosopher, educational and medical reformist, mystic and artist, Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925) was the founder of a spiritual movement he dubbed Anthroposophy, and of the famous school system that bears his name. Anthroposophy combined elements of German philosophy with Theosophical theory, and also made use of architecture, dance (“Eurthymy”), painting and sculpture to illustrate his ideas. Steiner’s artworks occupy a fascinatingly ambiguous status as both pedagogical and aesthetic entities, and served as springboards for the early work of Mondrian and Kandinsky among others; they have continued to influence artists down the generations. In 1992, Steiner’s panel drawings were exhibited at the Galerie Monika Sprüth in Cologne, renewing their efficacy for contemporary artists. Published for the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg’s 2010 exhibition, this book is the first assessment of the influence of Anthroposophical thought on contemporary art.

# Caravaggio: The Complete Works  

# Edited and text by Rossella Vodret.  

Dramatic shifts from foreboding dark to probing light, with minimal gradation in between; a realism that exposes all the flaws and folds of human flesh, eschewing Michelangelo’s idealized bodies; a surgical explication of almost unbearably tense emotion; and the poised depiction of crucial moments at the very lip of their unfolding: these were among the innovations of Michelangelo Merisi, known as Caravaggio. Without them, as the great Italian art writer Roberto Longhi once noted,“Ribera, Vermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed... and the art of Delacroix, Courbet and Manet would have been utterly different.” It was Longhi who rescued Caravaggio’s painting for the twentieth century, prior to which it had lain dormant since the painter’s mysterious death in 1610. During Caravaggio’s lifetime, however, his work was enormously influential and controversial. Each of his innovations in some way upset the prevailing tendencies of the day—not least when his insistence on physical realism led him to paint Saint Matthew as a bald peasant with dirty legs (attended upon by an irreverently intimate boy angel). Nonetheless, Caravaggio was never short of commissions or patrons, and left to posterity around 80 masterpieces. This monograph is published on the fourth centenary of Caravaggio’s death, and documents his complete paintings in high-quality reproductions. Authored by renowned scholar Rossella Vodret, it is the must-have monograph on the artist. Michelangelo Merisi, known as Caravaggio, was born in 1571 and made his debut in 1600 with two public commissions on the theme of Saint Matthew. He soon became notorious for his temper, and killed a young man in 1606; two further contretemps in Malta and Naples are recorded—the latter, in 1609, involving an attempt on his life—and by 1610 he was dead, after a brief but extraordinary career.

# Michelangelo: The Drawings of a Genius Edited by Achim Gnann. Text by Klaus Albrecht Schröder.  

Michelangelo’s drawings endowed human physique with an expressive musculature that remains to be rivaled in its feeling for corporeal articulation. His drawings of male nudes in particular, fraught as they are with tempestuous longing, project both tension and pliancy, and a compelling sense of health in the exertions and torque of bodies; he was also readily able to bring contrary qualities of grace and swiftness to depictions of women and cherubim. With over $300$ color plates and extensive contextualizing scholarship, Michelangelo: The Drawings of a Genius is the most complete treatment of this work ever published, and thus constitutes a publication of great importance. Masterpieces from the world’s finest museums are gathered here, from the early studies for the “Battle of Cascina” and the studies for the Sistine Chapel frescoes, to the drawings for the tomb of Julius II, the Medici tombs, the drawings for Tommaso de’ Cavalieri and the later crucifixion scenes; also addressed are those works whose authenticity has been subject to debate. Works by other artists, done after the master’s sketches, further illuminate the enormous influence of Michelangelo’s art. Painter, sculptor, poet, architect and engineer, Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (1475–1564) was both dauntingly prolific and relentlessly innovative in output. He sculpted two of his greatest works, the “Pieta” and “David,” before he turned 30, and created two of the world’s best-known paintings on the ceiling and walls of the Sistine Chapel in Rome—the creation scenes from “Genesis” and “The Last Judgment.” Giorgio Vasari proposed that Michelangelo represented the pinnacle of all artistic achievement since the beginning of the Renaissance, a view that has survived to this day.

# Antonio López García: Drawings Text by Francisco Calvo Serraller, Antonio López García.  

The Spanish artist Antonio López García is revered worldwide not only for the extreme realism he brings to his paintings and drawings, but because he conveys through this extreme realism a wonderful sensitivity to light, color and space, enabling each to breathe with a tranquility that allows for the encroachments of everyday life. Interior scenes of dining tables, bathroom sinks, toilets, dressers are depicted in sober light that recall Chardin or the “intimisme” of Vuillard— though López García surpasses even these masters in his ability to make unforgivingly prosaic subject matter, such as a brick wall or a refrigerator, sparkle and throb with mood. The artist’s statement that “you work until the whole surface has an expressive intensity equivalent to what you have before you, converted into a pictorial reality” conveys something of the labor he brings to his works: López García is not a prolific artist, and as a result shows rarely (his 2008 exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, consolidated his already strong audience in the U.S.). His drawings and paintings are equally esteemed, but until now, the drawings have never been the subject of a monograph. All of the work in this superbly designed publication has been carefully selected by the artist’s daughter, Maria; much of it has never been reproduced until now. Including 200 color plates and a moving text by the artist himself, it stands as a powerful testimony to López García’s astounding achievement. Antonio López García (born 1936) studied at the School of Art in Madrid in the early 1950s, and quickly became part of a nucleus of realist painters, such as Francisco López Hernández, Amalia Avia and Isabel Quintanilla. López García was the subject of Víctor Erice’s 1992 film El Sol del Membrillo (The Quince Tree of the Sun), which closely chronicles the artist’s attempts to paint a quince tree.

# Lucian Freud: The Studio  

# Foreword by Alain Seban. Preface by Alfred Pacquement. Introduction by Cécile Debray. Text by Éric Darragon, Jean Clair, Laurence des Cars, Philippe Comar, Richard Shiff, Cécile Debray, Elsa Urtizverea.  

One of the greatest living painters and portraitists, Lucian Freud (born 1922) brings a powerfully obsessive scrutiny to bear upon his subjects. “I want the painting to be flesh,” Freud has avowed, and through this aspiration he achieves almost devastatingly unsentimental and revelatory portraits of his sitters, as he translates the act of scrutiny into strokes of paint. Like the studio of his friend Francis Bacon, Freud’s own studio has attained its own intensity as the site of his one-on-one encounters, and as a backdrop or stage in his paintings, and the atmosphere of his interiors, and in the light in them, are among his paintings’ most pungent qualities. (One of his earliest canvases, from 1944, is titled “The Painter’s Room.”) Accompanying the critically acclaimed spring 2010 Pompidou retrospective, this mammoth survey posits Freud’s studio as the decisive stage for his art, and tracks his career in over 200 color illustrations of paintings, graphic works and photographs. Included here are his large interiors, his nudes and variations on portraits by earlier masters, his famous series of selfportraits and imposing portraits of sitters such as Leigh Bowery and substantial photographic documentation of the studio. Lucian Freud: The Studio is the essential book on the artist. Grandson of Sigmund Freud, Lucian Freud was born in Germany in 1922, and permanently relocated to London in 1933 during the ascent of the Nazi regime. After seeing brief service during the Second World War, Freud had his first solo exhibition in 1944 at the Alex Reid & Lefevre Gallery in London. Despite exhibiting only occasionally over the course of his career, Freud’s 1995 portrait “Benefits Supervisor Sleeping” was sold at auction, at Christie’s New York in May 2008, for \$33.6 million—setting a world record for sale value of a painting by a living artist.

Paul Strand in Mexico tells the story of the photographer’s journeys through Mexico in the early 1930s. In search of a fresh start, Strand traveled to Mexico City in late 1932 at the invitation of Carlos Chavez, the eminent Mexican composer and conductor. The work he created during this key period reflects a time of intense productivity, creative renewal, and the evolution of Strand’s foundational idea of the “collective portrait,” in which he depicted a region through photographs of individuals, still lifes and studies of architecture and religious subjects. The first publication to chronicle this pivotal time in Strand’s career (1932–34), Paul Strand in Mexico demonstrates how, through his photographic studies and work in film, Strand deepened his involvement with Mexican art, society, and revolutionary politics. Shedding new light on this little-known chapter of Strand’s life, a scholarly analysis by James Krippner (Associate Professor of History at Haverford College, Pennsylvania) brings together primary research from distinguished archives and institutions in both Mexico and the United States, and Mexican photo-historian Alfonso Morales contributes an essay contextualizing this remarkable body of work within the canon of Mexican photography and film of the 1930s. Additionally, the appendix serves as the catalogue raisonné of Strand’s entire photographic output in Mexico. The culmination of Strand’s time in Mexico was his collaboration with Emilio Gomez Muriel and Academy Award–winning director Fred Zinnemann on the groundbreaking film, Redes (The Wave) (1936). A remastered DVD version of the film is included with this essential volume.  

Paul Strand (1890–1976) is one of the great photographers of the twentieth century. As a youth, he studied under Lewis Hine at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, going on to draw acclaim from such illustrious sources as Alfred Stieglitz. After World War II, Strand traveled around the world—from New England to Ghana to France to the Outer Hebrides— to photograph, and in the process created a dynamic and significant body of work.

# Sally Mann: The Flesh and The Spirit  

Sally Mann: The Flesh and The Spirit is the first in-depth exploration of this world-renowned artist’s approach to the body. Throughout her career, Mann has fearlessly pushed her exploration of the human form, tackling often difficult subject matter and making unapologetically sensual images that are simultaneously bold and lyrical. This beautifully produced publication includes Mann’s earliest platinum prints from the late 1970s, Polaroid still lifes, early color work of her children, haunting landscape images, recent self-portraits and nude studies of her husband. These series document Mann’s interest in the body as principal subject, with the associated issues of vulnerability and mortality lending an elegiac note to her images. In bringing them together, author and curator John Ravenal examines the varied ways in which Mann’s experimental approach, including ambrotypes and gelatin-silver prints made from collodian wet-plate negatives, moves her subjects from the corporeal to the ethereal. Ravenal also supplies a comprehensive introduction as well as individual entries on each series, and essays by David Levi Strauss (“Eros, Psyche, and the Mendacity of Photography”) and Anne Wilkes Tucker (“Living Memory”) add different, but equally illuminating perspectives to this work. Sally Mann: The Flesh and The Spirit is a must for any serious library of photographic literature, students, scholars, collectors and others interested in her work.  

Sally Mann (born 1951) is one of America’s most renowned photographers. She has received numerous awards, including NEA, NEH, and Guggenheim Foundation grants, and her work is held by major institutions internationally. Mann’s many books include What Remains (2003), Deep South (2005), and the Aperture titles At Twelve (1988), Immediate Family (1992), Still Time (1994) and Proud Flesh (2009). She lives in Lexington, Virginia.

# Hiroshi Sugimoto  

# Edited by Pia Müller-Tamm. Text by Hiroshi Sugimoto, Kerry Brougher.  

Genius of the large-format camera, the long exposure and the silverprint, New York-based photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto has made pictures that seem to contain whole aeons of time within themselves, and suggest an infinite palette of tonal wealth in blacks, grays and whites. Many of these images have now become a part of art culture’s popular image bank (as U2’s use of Sugimoto’s “Boden Sea” for the cover of their 2009 album, No Line on the Horizon, demonstrated), while simultaneously evoking photography’s earliest days:“I probably call myself a postmodernexperienced pre-postmodern modernist,” he once joked to an interviewer. This absolutely exquisite retrospective is an expanded edition of Hatje Cantz’s 2005 volume. It is the first to feature works from all of Sugimoto’s series to date: his celebrated portraits of wax figures, his incredible seascapes that seem to suggest a person’s first conscious view of the ocean, the extremely long exposures of theaters which elevate the white, luminescent cinema screen and transform it into a magical image of an altar and the fascinating dioramas of scientific display cases, which invite us to travel far into the past. Additions to the original edition are two new groups of works,“Lightning Fields” (2006) and “Photogenic Drawings” (2007).

# John Gossage: The Pond Text by Gerry Badger, Toby Jurovics.  

Considered a groundbreaking book when first published in 1985, John Gossage’s The Pond remains one of the most important photobooks of the medium. As Gerry Badger, coauthor of The Photobook: A History, Volumes I and II, asserts,“Adams, Shore, Baltz—all the New Topographics photographers made great books, but none are better than The Pond.” Consisting of photographs taken around and away from a pond situated in an unkempt wooded area at the edge of a city, the volume presents a considered foil to Henry Thoreau’s stay at Walden. The photographs in The Pond do not aspire to the “beauty” of classical landscapes in the tradition of Ansel Adams. Instead, they reveal a subtle vision of reality on the border between man and nature. Gossage depicts nature in full splendor, yet at odds with both itself and man, but his tone is ambiguous and evocative rather than didactic. Robert Adams described the work as “believable because it includes evidence of man’s darkness of spirit, memorable because of the intense fondness [Gossage] shows for the remains of the natural world.” Aperture now reissues this exquisitely produced and highly collectible classic monograph. With the addition of three images and two essays, this second edition offers new audiences the opportunity to celebrate this notable work by a master photographer and bookmaker.  

John Gossage (born 1946) is well known for his artist’s books and photographic publications, and has produced 17 books and boxes on specific bodies of work. In the 1960s, he studied briefly with Lisette Model and Alexey Brodovitch. Since then, his work has been exhibited worldwide. His photographs are held in numerous private and public collections, including those of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and The Museum of Modern Art, New York. Gossage lives in Washington, D.C.

Light has been a theme throughout: in early instances it appears as invasive, interrogational and blinding. In more recent images it is atmospheric and all-engulfing. My primary project has always been in finding ways to make the viewer aware of their own activity of looking at something.

# Uta Barth: The Long Now Text by Jonathan Crary, Russell Ferguson, Holly Myers.  

Often blurred or with only one element rendered sharply, clinging to the margin of the composition, Uta Barth’s deceptively simple photographs of ordinary, ambiguous places are both elegant and challenging. Walls, windows, patches of light on a rug, the glow of an out-of-focus glance toward the horizon: all these provoke phenomenological reflections on perception and subjectivity, often suspending a viewer in the midst of the customary attempt to make sense of what is being seen, to reduce it to an accessible package of associations and meaning. “Certain expectations are unfulfilled: expectations of what a photograph normally depicts, of how we are supposed to read the space in the image, of how a picture normally presents itself on the wall,” Barth has said. “This kind of questioning and reorientation is the point of entry and discovery, not only in a cognitive way, but in an almost visceral, physical and personal sense.”This comprehensive monographic volume presents a definitive overview of Barth’s works, fully illustrated with more than 300 full-color reproductions, spanning from her earliest photographs to her most recent. New texts by Russell Ferguson, former Chief Curator of the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; Holly Myers, art critic and writer; and renowned scholar Jonathan Crary provide critical perspectives on the work of this visionary artist.  

Born in Berlin in 1958, and now resident in Los Angeles, Uta Barth is represented in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, the Whitney, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the Tate in London. In 2007 Barth was named a Broad Art Foundation Fellow.

# László Moholy-Nagy: The Art of Light  

Edited by Hattula Moholy-Nagy. Text by Oliva María Rubio, Vicenzo Vitiello, Hubertus von Amenluxen, Hattula Moholy-Nagy, Frans Peterse, Oliver A.I. Botar, Jeanpaul Goergen.  

An artist and thinker of astounding energy and ability, László Moholy-Nagy was a true world citizen of the early twentieth century, an ambassador-at-large for Constructivism, Suprematism, Dada and the Bauhaus. He brought the same Constructivist optimism to every medium he tackled, from plexiglass and light sculpture to typography to his photographic experiments in color to his Suprematist canvases, his influential pedagogy at the Bauhaus and at the Institute of Design in Chicago. Moholy-Nagy’s concept of the arts as a totality, his pedagogy and his confidence in the new industrial culture that would level distinctions between art and craft led him into all fields of creative production. The ultimate “modernist Renaissance man,” Moholy-Nagy was prolific in so many realms that his detractors inevitably charged him with dilettantism. This accusation ignores his very real innovations in photography—for example his “photograms”—and light sculpture, as well as the fact that the artist’s aims possessed a conceptual unity in their common aspiration to make an “art of light.” László Moholy-Nagy: The Art of Light presents Moholy-Nagy’s work in all of its glorious unity and diversity. Including more than 200 works, from painting, photography (black and white and color) and photograms to collages, films and graphic design, it emphasizes his greatest years of productivity, from 1922 to the end of his life. The Art of Light is the new definitive volume on this hero of modernism.  

László Moholy-Nagy (1895–1946) was born in Hungary, and moved to Berlin in 1920, where he taught at the Bauhaus for five years. After a spell in the U.K., he moved to America, founding the School of Design in Chicago, which became the Illinois Institute of Technology, in 1939. He died in 1946.

# Weimar Cinema 1919–193 Daydreams and Nightmares  

Edited by Laurence Kardish. Text by Ulrich Döge, Thomas Elsaesser, Laurence Kardish, Claudia Lenssen, Eric Rentschler, Werner Sudendorff.  

Published in conjunction with The Museum of Modern Art’s presentation of 75 feature-length films from the Weimar era, many only recently restored, Weimar Cinema reconsiders the broad spectrum of influential films made in Germany between the World Wars. German and American films competed on the world market, and the stylistic accomplishments of the many German film artists who emigrated to Hollywood before Hitler took power deeply affected American cinema. Weimar Cinema is the first comprehensive survey of this period to include popular films—musicals, comedies, the “daydreams” of the working class—along with the “nightmarish” classics such as Fritz Lang’s Dr. Mabuse der Spieler and M; F.W. Murnau’s Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens; and G.W. Pabst’s Pandora’s Box. Richly illustrated with film stills, the book examines how and why our understanding of these films has changed in the last half century, and investigates important themes in films from this period, including the portrayal of women and the role of sound. Supplementing the essays is a detailed illustrated filmography of the 75 films featured in the exhibition; each film is accompanied by a brief description and excerpts from contemporaneous reviews.

The Weimar era saw the birth of Expressionism and the transition to sound cinema, and produced such masterpieces as Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, F.W. Murnau’s Nosferatu, Carl Boese and Paul Wegener’s The Golem, Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and Josef von Sternberg’s The Blue Angel.

Edited by Joshua Siegel, Marie-Christine de Navacelle. Text by Andrew Delbanco, David Denby, Pierre Legendre, Errol Morris, Jay Neugeboren, Marie-Christine de Navacelle, Geoffrey O’Brien, Christopher Ricks, Catherine Samie, Joshua Siegel, William T. Vollmann, Frederick Wiseman.  

For over four decades, from his landmark Titicut Follies (1967) to his recent La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet (2009) and forthcoming Boxing Gym (2010), Frederick Wiseman (born 1930) has used a lightweight 16mm camera and portable sound equipment to study human behavior in all its unpredictable manifestations, particularly as it responds to institutional or regimented settings or to democracy at work. Combining epic narrative with intimate portraiture, Wiseman’s films constitute a grand panorama of modern life, a kind of modern-day comédie humaine. While he manages to intrude only minimally on the lives of his subjects, his sensitive eye, lawyerly skepticism and storytelling impulses produce imaginative truth. Wiseman has also worked in the theater, directing acclaimed adaptations of Beckett and Pirandello. His stage and film productions La Dernière Lettre (The Last Letter), based on Vassily Grossman’s epic novel Life and Fate, starred Catherine Samie, doyenne of the Comédie-Française and a contributor to this book. Frederick Wiseman, the first publication in English to provide a comprehensive overview of Wiseman’s career to date, includes essays by eminent observers on both sides of the Atlantic, including writers, critics, filmmakers, actors and Wiseman himself. Illustrated with stills from his films, this volume offers a compelling portrait of Frederick Wiseman as one of the world’s most innovative, fearless and influential filmmakers, as well as an accomplished theater director. Frederick Wiseman has made $^{38}$ films that stand as a monumental chronicle of late-twentieth-century institutional and cultural life. His controversial 1967 debut feature Titicut Follies, a look at conditions inside the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, remains the only American film ever censored for reasons other than national security or obscenity. His 2009 film La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet has been a tremendous critical and popular success both in the United States and abroad. Wiseman’s latest documentary, about an amateur boxing gym in Austin, Texas, had its premiere at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, and he is currently editing a film about the Crazy Horse Saloon, the legendary cabaret in Paris.

# Tim Hetherington: Infidel Introduction by Sebastian Junger.  

Infidel is an intimate portrait of a single U.S. platoon, assigned to an outpost in the Korengal Valley—an area considered one of the most dangerous Afghan postings in the war against the Taliban—but it is as much about love and male vulnerability as it is about bravery and war. Embedded with writer Sebastian Junger, and shooting over the course of one year, photographer Tim Hetherington made a series of images that prove surprisingly tender in their depiction of camaraderie and vulnerability (among the most moving is a series of the platoon sleeping). Alongside revealing interviews with Hetherington’s subjects and an introduction by Junger (with whom Hetherington co-directed the award-winning film Restrepo, about the work of the battalion), the book is also illustrated with graphics of the tattoos the soldiers gave each other in the camp. The title Infidel is taken from the tattoo the men adopted as a badge of their comradeship. Warm, moving and full of humor, this book is a tribute to the “rough men ready to do violence on our behalf” and a provocative contribution to the documentation of war in our time. Tim Hetherington was born in Liverpool, U.K., and took up photojournalism after studying literature at Oxford University. Five years spent living in Liberia resulted in the book Long Story Bit By Bit: Liberia Retold (2009), and awards for his photojournalism include World Press Photo of the Year 2007 (for his dramatic war photography from Afghanistan). As a filmmaker, he has worked as both a cameraman and director/ producer. Restrepo won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. He is based in New York and is a contributing photographer for Vanity Fair magazine.

# Phyllis Galembo: Maske Introduction by Chika Okeke-Agulu.  

The clothes we wear invariably telegraph information about our identity, our place in society and the stories we wish to convey about ourselves. The fantastically colorful costumes specific to African and Caribbean rituals and celebrations go several steps further, transforming ordinary people into mythic figures and magicians, tricksters and gods, and symbolizing the roles their wearers play in the ancient dramas that form the cornerstones of their cultural heritage. Phyllis Galembo began photographing the characters and costumes of African masquerade in Nigeria in 1985, and since then she has continued developing her theme throughout Africa and the Caribbean. This volume collects 108 thrilling carnival photographs from Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Zambia and Haiti. In magnificent color shots, Galembo’s subjects pose in striped bodysuits that cover the entire body, including the face; or outfits made entirely of bunched greenery; or a lacquered wooden mask topped with a headdress featuring full-body models of other characters; or an oversize misshapen animal head and plywood wings. The carnival characters, rooted in African religion and spirituality, are presented in chapters organized by tribal or carnival tradition and are accompanied by Galembo’s personal commentary, shedding light on the characters and costumes portrayed, and on the events in which they play a pivotal role. Maske is a serious contribution to ethnographic study, a photo-essay about fashion and an assembly of superb images.

With a keen eye and strong political instincts, photographer Peter Bialobrzeski (born 1961) has made photobooks about new Asian metropolises, wastelands on the outskirts of global cities and a Filipino squatters’ camp. His latest project, Informal Arrangements, opens a window onto the interiors of a South African slum. In 2009, Bialobrzeski shot in Kliptown, a poverty-stricken suburb of Soweto less than ten miles away from a glistening new soccer stadium built for the 2010 World Cup. The area’s resonance as a symbol of the vast discrepancies of wealth and status that persist in present-day South Africa— representing, as the South African newspaper The Citizen put it, “the dashed hopes and broken dreams of so many”—is unmistakable, and Kliptown has a larger historical significance: it was here, in 1955, that members of the antiapartheid movement drew up the Freedom Charter, a guiding document for the ANC that today forms a foundation of the South African constitution. The lives of the inhabitants of these informal settlements have scarcely improved in the past 50 years, yet the Kliptownians arrange their homes as comfortably as they can, given what is available to them. With 70 color prints, this book cements Bialobrzeski’s reputation as a social documentarian of the highest order. “For me, the individual picture is not too important,” he has said. “I am advocating photography as a cultural practice.”

# James Mollison: Where Children Sleep  

Where Children Sleep presents English-born photographer James Mollison’s large-format photographs of children’s bedrooms around the world—from the U.S.A., Mexico, Brazil, England, Italy, Israel and the West Bank, Kenya, Senegal, Lesotho, Nepal, China and India—alongside portraits of the children themselves. Each pair of photographs is accompanied by an extended caption that tells the story of each child: Kaya in Tokyo, whose proud mother spends \$1,000 a month on her dresses; Bilal the Bedouin shepherd boy, who sleeps outdoors with his father’s herd of goats; the Nepali girl Indira, who has worked in a granite quarry since she was three; and Ankhohxet, the Kraho boy who sleeps on the floor of a hut deep in the Amazon jungle. Photographed over two years with the support of Save the Children (Italy), Where Children Sleep is both a serious photo-essay for an adult audience, and also an educational book that engages children themselves in the lives of other children around the world. Its cover features a child’s mobile printed in glow-in-the-dark ink.  

James Mollison was born in Kenya in 1973 and grew up in England. After studying art and design at Oxford Brookes, and later film and photography at Newport School of Art and Design, he moved to Italy to work at Benetton’s creative lab, Fabrica. His work has been widely published throughout the world in Colors, The New York Times Magazine, the Guardian magazine, The Paris Review, the New Yorker, Le Monde and elsewhere. His previous books published by Chris Boot include The Disciples (2008), The Memory of Pablo Escobar (2007) and James and Other Apes (2004). Mollison has lived in Venice since 2003.

More than half of supermarket multi-buy promotions are for high-fat or high-sugar foods, despite the fact that health advice dictates that these should not make up more than seven percent of our diet. More than ten million children die every year and the underlying cause for most of these deaths is starvation. Twenty-seven million tons of fish are discarded as waste every year. So how is it that malnutrition is so widespread in the developing world, while obesity is rife in the developed world? What exactly is the nutritional value of junk food versus the health benefits of fresh fruit and vegetables? Do you know what really goes into the production of the food on your plate? Gathering information culled from some of the most authoritative sources around the world, The Little Book of Shocking Food Facts is jam-packed with truths you need to know about global food politics, fast food culture and healthy nutrition. This startling but visually stunning book will alter the way you think about food production and change your eating habits for the better. Extended footnotes provide full citations for all information sources, as well as easy-to-understand texts that explain the facts in detail.

How is it that the developed world spends billions of dollars annually on weaponry, while the poor of the developing world have no access to education, medicines or even clean drinking water? What exactly is the relationship between cheap goods on the high street and the wage-slavery of sweatshops? How have large corporations branded the world? The Little Book of Shocking Global Facts is a powerful visual manifesto by one of today’s most respected graphic designers, Jonathan Barnbrook and his studio. This ethically driven book questions the status quo of world politics, highlights the inequalities and iniquities of rampant capitalism and demonstrates compellingly through words and pictures that unfettered $\mathrm{g}|$ obalization is a highly destructive force when used for profit or political power, and that a more compassionate world order needs to be instigated. This important manifesto for global change will undoubtedly transform its readers’ hearts and minds.

# Cult-ure By Rian Hughes.  

Culture is your local consensus reality; your clothing, cuisine and hairstyle, the music you listen to, the films you see; your values, ideas, beliefs and prejudices. Culture, unlike race, is not quite an inevitability of birth, but ultimately, in its choice of statements, an intellectual position. Today culture has a powerful new vector: the internet. Ideas—from a YouTube video to a viral marketing phenomenon or a fundamentalist religion—are traveling further and faster, and changing the cultural landscape like never before. In a new electronic democracy of ideas, cultural power is devolving to the creative individual. Amid our symbol-drenched existences, we desperately need a way of decoding the messages that bombard us. Written and designed by author and artist Rian Hughes, and sporting such design features as a faux-leather cover, die-cuts and tip-ins, Cult-ure is the culmination of a decade’s research into why and how we communicate. Revealing how ideas are transmitted through words, symbols and gestures, how such ideas gain cultural currency via the theory of the meme, this book provides a provocative exploration into media convergence within our digital age and an insider’s guide into the changing nature of communications, perceptions and identities; it is the twenty-first century’s answer to Marshall McLuhan and Quentin Fiore’s seminal graphic collaboration The Medium Is the Massage (which punned on McLuhan’s famous motto “the medium is the message” to suggest the ways in which media directly tweaks our sensorium). Cult-ure is a guide to surviving the new media revolution. Rian Hughes is an award-winning graphic designer, typographer and author. He studied graphic design at the London College of Printing before working for $j D$ magazine and a number of record sleeve design companies. In 1994 he founded his own studio, Device. Hughes is described by Roger Sabin of $E y e$ magazine as “one of the most successful and prolific British designer-illustrators of the past 20 years,” and by writer David Quantick as “a luminescent pop culture demon.”

# Sustainism Is the New Modernism A Cultural Manifesto for the Sustainist Era By Michiel Schwarz, Joost Elffers.  

Michiel Schwarz and Joost Elffers’ Sustainism Is the New Modernism declares the dawn of a new cultural era, as we transition from modernity to sustainity—towards a world that is more connected, more localist, more digital and more sustainable. As the authors of this clear-eyed manifesto argue, sustainism “marks a shift not only in thinking and doing but in collective perception—of how we live, do business, feed ourselves, design, travel and communicate, as much as how we deal with nature.” In the twentieth century, whether we knew it or not, our world was shaped by modernist values, from the design of our cities to our homes, technologies and our conceptions of progress. Sustainism recasts our relationship to all of these things, binding ecological issues to a larger picture of our world. Through a series of graphically dynamic aphorisms, quotes and symbols designed for worldwide use by businesses, individuals and institutions, to signal support for sustainism, Michiel Schwarz and Joost Elffers show how the movement is already reshaping global culture, technology, food and media. With this concise manifesto, they launch the term sustainism into the public consciousness. The sustainist era has begun. Michiel Schwarz is a Dutch independent cultural thinker, innovator and producer, now working from Berkeley, California. Originally trained as a sociologist of technology, he has initiated projects on global issues, the future of design, technology and media. His publications include The Technological Culture and Speed: Visions of an Accelerated Age. Joost Elffers is a designer, “symbol maker” and creative producer of awardwinning and innovative books such as 48 Laws of Power, Play With Your Food and Tangram: The Ancient Chinese Shapes Game.

Sustainism goes beyond modernism and postmodernism, moving from rationalist and mechanistic to humanist and organic.  

Where modernism shaped the environment of the “machine age,” Sustainism defines the new ecology of the digital age.  

Sustainism embraces cyclical modes rather than the linearity of modernism; flow rather than structure.  

If modernity favored the square and the grid, sustainism tends to the round.  

Sustainism looks for what can be sustained, rather than “the perishable, transitory and the expendable” (as celebrated, for example, by the Futurists).  

Sustainism is in the air; it is the decisive paradigm shift of our prodigious cultural moment. Sustainism articulates a new stance towards our reality and insists on the remaking of our globalized world against the very real prospect of ecological disaster.

# Lifestyle Illustration of the 50s Edited by Rian Hughes.  

The determinedly forward-looking optimism of postwar Europe and America was nowhere more evidenced than in the magazine art of the 1950s. In cheery scenes of domestic harmony, of strong-jawed men and winsome women, the illustration arts declared that the wartime years of austerity and uncertainty were at an end and a sunnier, more aspirational culture was taking shape. Featuring over 1,000 beautiful and stylistically diverse illustrations, Lifestyle Illustration of the 50s charts the decade’s progression as western economies started to recover and youth culture began to assert itself in the market place. From stylish and urbane young couples in romantic clinches to professional men and women exploring their new-found affluence and economic independence, this book provides expert insight into the evolving styles, fashions, dreams and social mores of the 1950s, through an extensive gallery of rediscovered and restored artwork by some of the decade’s finest illustrators. An informative introduction explores the history of this long overlooked art form and orients its impact within wider social trends. Lifestyle Illustration of the 50s provides a nostalgic trip into a world of midcentury modern living.

# Lifestyle Illustration of the 60s Edited by Rian Hughes.  

The 1960s was an optimistic era of unprecedented change, and its heady zeitgeist was captured in the amazing range of artwork that adorned the magazines of the time. Lifestyle Illustration of the 60s is a colossal survey of magazine artwork from the Swinging Sixties. It not only provides revelatory insight into the extraordinary artistic talents of the illustrators featured— such as Austin Briggs, Lynn Buckham, Antonio Lopez and Coby Whitmore—but also tellingly elucidates the social aspirations of this era of political optimism and sexual freedom. Featuring over 1,000 gloriously inventive and stylistically diverse illustrations, Lifestyle Illustration of the 60s traces the decade’s dizzyingly swift evolution from the homemaking ethos of romantic coupledom to the stylish liberation of mini-skirted Chelsea girls and the psychedelic palette that evolved towards the decade’s close, conjuring a fabulous and euphoric pageant of 1960s pop culture from rediscovered artworks by the very best illustrators of the day. An inspirational sourcebook for contemporary designers and fans of 1960s culture, Lifestyle Illustration of the 60s provides a wonderful, nostalgic adventure into an aspirational world of stylishly sophisticated living, revealing just how much life has changed in the intervening decades.

# Custom Lettering of the 40s & 50s Edited by Rian Hughes.  

Before the invention of Letraset, the sheets of dry-transfer letters that became popular with designers in the 1960s, custom headline lettering styles were frequently drawn by hand, creating a limitless field of innovative, creative, fanciful letters full of stylistic freedom and an energy unfettered by typographic traditions and templates. The covers of dime-store comic books, serials and pulp novels, in particular, practically sang out with these designs, which are collected—an astonishing 4,500 lively examples in all—in Custom Lettering of the 40s & 50s, compiled by the award-winning graphic designer, illustrator, comic artist, logo designer and typographer Rian Hughes. Here you’ll find “The Planet of Stone-Age Men” spelled out in heavy block letters riddled with cracks as if the letters were stone themselves; the headline of a war serial rendered in outlined letters that appear vibrant, as ready to take off into the air as the propellor plane depicted beneath them; elegant looped copperplate script that waltzes across the page sedately; bold Art Deco capital letters that overlap each other like tango dancers’ legs; the tipsy, effervescent letters of the word “Cocktail”; and many more. Certain to become an indispensable sourcebook for graphic designers, typographers, art directors, anybody who works in advertising and indeed everybody who cares not only about the words they read but how those words look, Custom Lettering of the 40s & 50s is an encyclopedic treasury.

# Custom Lettering of the 60s & 70s Edited by Rian Hughes.  

When personal computers became de rigueur for the design world, their font lists standardized the array of typefaces available to layout artists and typesetters. But in the decades before computer dominance, hand-drawn fonts were the highlight of television, comic book and promotional design. Rian Hughes, an award-winning graphic designer, illustrator, comic artist, logo designer and typographer who has designed record album sleeves and worked in advertising and for i-D magazine, has combed the archives of custom lettering to bring together literally thousands—4,500, to be exact— examples of inspiring and enlightening hand-lettered fonts from the 60s and 70s. Motion and activity were key components of design in this jet-powered era; letters frequently seem to be racing across the page, leaning eagerly into the future, bursting in concentric arcs from a distant sun, exploding from a single perspective point at the bottom of the page or the rear of the picture plane, plumping themselves up into dramatic three-dimensional space, or a combination of two or more of these activities. With a distinct air of retro cool, but old enough to be rarely seen in print today, these letters will fascinate and inspire anybody who works with letters or is interested in the way they look: graphic designers, typographers, art directors, anybody who works in advertising, students, illustrators and lovers of vintage design of all sorts.

# Arnold Scaasi: American Couturier Text by Pamela A. Parmal.  

Barbra Streisand, Natalie Wood, Arlene Francis, Diahann Carroll, Joan Rivers, Mamie Eisenhower, Barbara Bush, Louise Nevelson… What these women have in common is that all were dressed by Scaasi. From his meteoric rise on Seventh Avenue in the late 1950s through his heyday in the boom decade of the 1980s, Arnold Scaasi has remained one of the most distinctive and successful designers in American fashion. With his signature combination of elegance, flamboyance, surprising colors and fabrics, and finely honed craftsmanship, Scaasi is both a bold American original and a couturier in the grand European tradition. Arnold Scaasi: American Couturier presents the best of Scaasi’s fashions in a handsomely packaged, fluidly organized volume. Alongside sumptuous portraits of more than three dozen outfits, the book features numerous period photographs; sketches, notes and clippings from Scaasi’s personal archives, most of them never before published; and interviews with Scaasi’s famous clients, such as Joan Rivers, Mary Tyler Moore and Diahann Carroll, conducted specifically for this volume. A feast for fashion watchers and design aficionados alike, American Couturier contains all the glamour and thrill that for decades have been synonymous with the Scaasi label. Arnold Scaasi (born 1931) apprenticed at the House of Paquin in Paris, before moving to New York to work with Charles James. In 1956 he began a ready-to-wear line; in 1968, he caught the eye of a worldwide audience when Barbra Streisand wore his overblouse and pants ensemble to collect her Academy Award for Funny Girl, making Scaasi a household name overnight.

# Jewelry by Artists  

# In the Studio, 1940–2000  

Text by Kelly H. L’Ecuyer, Gerald W.R. Ward, Yvonne J. Markowitz, Michelle Finamore.  

Studio jewelry is defined not by an aesthetic or philosophy, but by its makers and their work process. Studio jewelers are independent artists in small workshops, directly handling their materials and producing one-of-a-kind pieces that are both decorative object and fine sculpture. As recognition of American studio jewelry has increased in recent years, so has the need for a comprehensive history— and this beautifully designed and lavishly illustrated volume is that book. Featuring over 150 bracelets, brooches, necklaces and rings from the world-renowned Daphne Farago Collection, Studio Jewelry presents the major events, ideas and individuals who shaped the field, and maps its evolution since it emerged within the modern studio craft movement. It also addresses the questions underlying the history of studio jewelry: jewelry as sculpture and personal adornment, the relationship between jewelry and the body, the use of non-traditional materials and the cultural meaning of the pieces. Finally, the book spans the variety of approaches in the field, while offering in-depth discussions of such key artistjewelers as Alexander Calder, Art Smith, Margaret De Patta, Robert Ebendorf and Gijs Bakker. Much more than the catalogue of an important individual collection, Studio Jewelry is an essential reference work for anyone creating, teaching or collecting in the field of studio jewelry today.

# Hairstyles: Ancient to Present Edited and with text by Charlotte Fiell.  

No part of the human body is as culturally determined, and as diverse in its possible expressions, as hair. The afro, beehive, bob, bouffant, bowl cut, dreadlocks, mullet, mohawk, perm, pompadour—from year to year, and from era to era, old and new hairstyles come and go, telling a new tale about their wearers each time around. Hairstyles: Ancient to Present is not only the most comprehensive survey of hairstyles ever published, it is also a visual celebration of this endlessly inventive cultural phenomenon that looks at the entire cultural spectrum of hairstyle, from ancient Greek tresses and eighteenthcentury powdered wigs to Art Deco bobs and Punk spikes, to the latest directions in the world of hairdressing today.

# Show Dogs: A Photographic Breed Guide Edited by Stacy Wakefield. Photographs by Kate Lacey.  

The American Kennel Club recognizes over 160 breeds of dogs in seven categories: Hound, Working, Sporting, Non-sporting, Terrier, Toy and Herding. Thousands of Americans own purebred show dogs, and year round, local kennel clubs host events at which judges evaluate how closely individual dogs conform to breed standard. Ribbons and trophies are bestowed and points are accumulated. The ultimate event in a show dog’s life is Westminster—held in New York every year since 1877—which attracts hordes of visitors and an international media bonanza. In 2005 Life magazine assigned photographer Kate Lacey to cover Westminster. She decided that instead of documenting the scene, she would rig up a seamless backdrop to make elegant portraits, much as Richard Avedon once captured glamorous celebrities. Though partial to poodle mutt mixes herself, on this assignment Kate became entranced by show dogs, and their exquisite grooming and acclimatization to attention made them ready subjects. After the assignment ended, she continued traveling to dog shows in a quest to photograph every one of the AKC-recognized breeds. Some of the dogs in Show Dogs are veterans of years of shows, some are champions and some are just puppies; but their achievements in the ring are not the point. With each portrait you’ll just see the nickname given by the people who love them, not their official championship names, which convey their titles and lineage. The dogs in this book are like supermodels off duty, showing us a personal side in a candid moment. What we love about these dogs is not their fancy parentage and titles, but exactly what we love about every dog in our lives; their quirky and wonderful dogginess.

# The Concise Dictionary of Dress By Judith Clark & Adam Phillips  

Photographs by Norbert Schoerner. Edited by Robert Violette.  

A brilliant amalgam of psychoanalysis, literature, art and couture, The Concise Dictionary of Dress is bestselling author and psychoanalyst Adam Phillips and fashion curator Judith Clark’s inventive recasting of dress in terms of anxiety and desire. The book is structured as a dictionary, but an unusual one: Each entry—for words including “armor,”“brash,”“comfortable,”“conformist,”“diaphanous,” “essential,”“fashionable,”“loose,”“measured,”“plain,”“provocative,” “revealing,”“sharp,”“tight” and so on—is elucidated by a litany of highly unconventional definitions. “Loose,” for example, is “defined” as “1. Never knowingly over-attached; a disappearing act. 2. A moveable feast; not conforming to contour or arrangement; subject to influence and gravity; seeking direction. 3. Of uncertain boundary.” Phillips’ entries in The Concise Dictionary of Dress are paired with photographs of installations that Clark created among the rolling racks, rambling corridors and high-security vaults of the Victoria & Albert Museum’s vast reserve collections at Blythe House in west London. Cast objects and photographs, tableaux of clothing and accessories and metaphors of repression and ceremony continue the conversation. Phillips said that viewing the works at Blythe House is “like looking up a word in a dictionary and finding a picture instead of more words; it is not clear whether the word and its definition are the caption, or vice versa.”

Judith Clark is Reader in the field of Fashion and Museology at London College of Fashion, where she is Director (with Amy de la Haye) of M.A. Fashion Curation. Clark opened the first independent gallery of dress (Judith Clark Costume Gallery) in 1998, and has since curated major exhibitions at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, ModeMuseum in Antwerp, the Palazzo Pitti in Florence and Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Psychoanalyst and writer Adam Phillips is the author of $^{14}$ acclaimed books, most recently Side Effects and On Kindness (written with the historian Barbara Taylor). He is the editor of the New Penguin Freud translations, and a regular reviewer for the London Review of Books. Norbert Schoener is a German photographer and filmmaker, and the author of The Order of Things. He has exhibited at White Cube, Comme des Garçons and Chapman Fine Arts.

When Madonna’s Like a Virgin came out in 1984, it wasn’t just the songs that made a splash, it was her look. That crucifix jewelry! Those earrings! Those black rubber bracelets! The accessories that gave Madonna her stylistic edge and sparked millions of prepubescent copycats across the globe were the brainchild of Maripol, a designer and stylist who was working at the time as the art director of the Fiorucci store. “I was attracted by objects and I liked to use them by taking away their original meaning,” Maripol has said. “I would see something I liked and I’d say, ‘That would be great as an earring.’” An habitué of the same New York dance clubs as the singer, Maripol styled Madonna at the outset of the Material Girl’s career, both casually and also officially, on the Like a Virgin album cover, ensuring the singer an eternal spot in the pantheon of pop style icons. “I was already making the rubber jewelry and I was already making the crosses because of my love for the punks,” she said. $^{\prime\prime}{\sf S}0$ it was perfect for her.” Now Maripol, who has just launched a new line of colorful, affordable accessories for Marc Jacobs, opens up her scrapbooks of drawings, designs, photography and writing to create a book that captures her personality as an artist, beginning with her childhood and her arrival in New York as a 19-year-old art school student.  

Maripol moved to New York from France in 1976, where she became a part of the New York clubbing and music scene, styling Madonna and working on films such as Downtown 81 (starring Jean-Michel Basquiat and Deborah Harry). In the mid-1980s, she opened her own boutique, Maripolitan, in the NoHo area of New York. Maripol has also been art director on music videos for Cher, D’Angelo and Elton John, among others.

# Hedi Slimane: Anthology of a Decade  

In a 2003 conversation with then-Interview magazine editor Ingrid Sischy, French designer Hedi Slimane (born 1968) described his beginnings as a photographer:“I started taking pictures before I even began in fashion. I didn’t start with clothes until I was 16, but I had my first camera when I was 11. I’ve always taken pictures, almost like some people take notes or write down their thoughts.” As Hedi Slimane: Anthology of a Decade reveals, Slimane’s photographs, which traverse the music scene, the New York art scene, street fashion and haute couture, are as fresh as his groundbreaking work in fashion. Drawing on photographs taken throughout the past decade, this volume records Slimane’s early years in the fashion industry, before, during and after his tenures at Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior. It was during this decade that Slimane brought to men’s fashion an androgynous, rock verve that influenced couture worldwide. This selection of 175 color photographs lays bare Slimane’s inspirations for this look, evidencing his attention to both youth culture and more historical groundings in photography; in their composition, these pictures also affirm that the designer’s major contribution to contemporary haute couture has been his continual refinement of line and silhouette. Anthology of a Decade is revelatory both as a hitherto little-known instance of Slimane’s many talents, and as an elucidation of his work in fashion. Hedi Slimane (born 1968) was educated in Paris as a political scientist, art historian and as a tailor. From 1992 to 1995 he worked for Jean-Jacques Picart, and in 1997 he was appointed Collections and Art Director at Yves SaintLaurent. Slimane moved to Dior in 2000, winning much acclaim for his Dior fragrances and skincare lines. In 2008 he moved to the U.S., and began to exhibit his art, and to collaborate with artists and musicians in New York.

California Condors, Boris Karloff as Frankenstein, Japanese horror films and Gordon Matta-Clark are among the many influences that make up the world of Rodarte. In just five short years, Rodarte has upended the fashion scene, bringing Kate and Laura Mulleavy, the designers behind the company, to the forefront of contemporary design and visual culture. Kate and Laura, who live and work between downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena, California, have consistently brought their love of nature, film, art and science to bear upon their unconventional and exquisitely crafted collections. Burning, sanding, dyeing, knitting, twisting, staining and weaving are some of the many complex techniques that have entered into the Rodarte textural vocabulary. Kate and Laura’s past collaborations have included artists, actors, musicians and writers such as Miranda July, Autumn de Wilde, Ryan McGinley, Ari Marcopoulos and Darren Aronofsky. Created in collaboration with two of the art world’s most sought-after and acclaimed photographers, Catherine Opie and Alec Soth, this is the first publication to examine the world of Rodarte. For the occasion, each photographer has developed an entirely new body of work in collaboration with Kate and Laura Mulleavy, examining the many facets of Rodarte’s creative spectrum. Without any formal training in fashion, California-raised sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy, working as Rodarte, have become the most celebrated American designers at work today. Celebrities such as Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman and Charlotte Gainsbourg have all expressed their admiration for the Mulleavys, and Michelle Obama wore Rodarte at the opening ceremony of the 121st IOC session at the Copenhagen Opera House.

# Mark Abrahams  

One of the foremost fashion and magazine-cover photographers of the past two decades, American photographer Mark Abrahams has straddled the gap between fashion and celebrity portraiture with guileless simplicity and exacting care. A self-taught photographer, Abrahams portrays his subjects with an introspective depth and candor. His subjects run the gamut of the A-list: Julianne Moore, George Clooney, James Franco, Dakota Fanning, Sean Diddy Combs, Beyoncé Knowles, Ashley Olsen, Dennis Hopper, Lindsay Lohan, Larry Clark, Michelle Obama, Ed Ruscha, Philip Roth, Roberto Bolle, Evander Holyfield, Kate Winslet, Justin Timberlake, Tom Hanks, Rachel Weisz, Wyclef Jean and countless others. This volume provides a dazzling parade of the glitterati under Abrahams’ lens, devoid of affectation or artifice. Abrahams is donating his portion of the proceeds from this book to benefit Hope For Haiti Now.  

Mark Abrahams was born in 1958 in Santa Ana, California. The gift of a Nikon FM from his mother ignited his passion for photography. Working as a truck driver by day, Abrahams transformed his tiny bathroom into a functioning darkroom to develop film, retouch negatives and manipulate surfaces at night. Against all odds, in the early 1990s Abrahams found himself shooting iconic musicians, jetting to Milan with supermodels and landing editorial shoots with L’Uomo Vogue, German Vogue and American GQ.

# Visionaire No. 58: Spirit A Tribute to Lee Alexander McQueen  

Visionaire first featured the provocative fashion designs of Lee Alexander McQueen in 1996, and he remained a continuous inspiration and presence for the magazine, providing some of its most treasured contributions. In 2003, McQueen visited the New York offices and gallery of Visionaire to discuss collaborating on an issue of the magazine—an issue that sadly was never to be. Visionaire No. 58: Spirit is a tribute to McQueen’s genius and legacy. It gathers images inspired by McQueen from such contributors as Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, Nick Knight, Steven Klein and David Sims; these images are printed on paper embedded with wildflower seeds, so that, when planted, watered and exposed to sunlight, the pages will blossom. Spirit is presented in a case that is wrapped in an Alexander McQueen metalized brocade, featured in the designer’s Spring/Summer show of 2010, and is limited to an edition of 1,500 numbered copies. One of Visionaire’s most brilliant and giftworthy concepts to date, Spirit offers up a unique opportunity for artist, nature and reader to collaborate with one another, and celebrates the greatness of one of fashion’s greatest and most iconoclastic talents.

From El Lissitzky, Kurt Schwitters and Bruno Munari to Paul Chan, Lawrence Weiner and Richard Prince, modern artists have found ingenious ways of reinventing and reimagining books for children. With its expanded possibilities for visual play and storytelling, the children’s book as a form in itself has been increasingly explored by contemporary artists. Now, Visionaire 59: Fairytale presents a mini-library of children’s stories by contemporary artists and photographers in collaboration with writers. Ranging in themes from the delightful to the philosophical, and packaged in a luxurious slipcase, Visionaire’s newest issue offer a meditation on innocence and childlike creativity, and makes an ideal gift for readers of all ages. Founded in 1991 as a collection of artwork and images hand-assembled by a group of friends in a one-room apartment in New York City, Visionaire has since grown into one of the most highly sought-after fashion and art publications in the world. The New Yorker has characterized Visionaire magazine as “a creative playground for leading designers, artists, photographers and thinkers,” adding “it’s a gallery in print. A cabinet of irresistible curiosities. A daring iconoclast dressed to thrill.”

# Bossa Nova The Rise of Brazilian Music in the 60s Edited by Stuart Baker, Gilles Peterson.  

Spawned in the upscale beachside neighborhoods of Rio De Janeiro in the late 1950s, the laid-back sound and culture of Bossa Nova (“New Wave”) rode on a brief wave of optimism in Brazil: the country had just elected a new president, a five-year plan for prosperity had been laid out and the great architect Oscar Niemeyer had proposed his plans for the new modern city of Brasilia. Reflecting this optimism in its gentle and sunny soundworld, Bossa Nova quickly became a worldwide musical phenomenon. (The first Bossa Nova single to achieve international popularity was of course the Astrud Gilberto and Stan Getz hit “The Girl from Ipanema.”) But by 1964, as Bossa Nova was taking America and the world by storm, tanks were thundering through Rio de Janeiro as the country fell under the rule of a violent military dictatorship that would affect the lives of musicians and ordinary Brazilians alike for the next 20 years. Retrieving the unique visual culture of this moment, Bossa Nova features hundreds of stunning full-size record cover designs of Bossa Nova and later Brazilian music from the 1960s, such as M.P.B. (Musica Popular Brasileira) and Tropicalia. The book also comes complete with full accompanying text, essays and interviews on the historical, political and social context of this Brazilian music as well as features on all the important artists and musicians of the era such as Sergio Mendes, Tom Jobim, Jorge Ben, Elis Regina, Caetano Veloso and many more. As the first visual treatment of this now popular music, Bossa Nova is both a pleasure and a revelation.

# Rock Paper Show: Flatstock Volume One Edited by Geoff Peveto. Introduction by Clay Hayes.  

The first decade of the twenty-first century marked a highpoint at the intersection of graphic design and music. Against the backdrop of the digital music revolution, the rock poster has suddenly reemerged as an art form, and as a memento or calling card of a remarkably talented group of artists and design studios. Rock Paper Show: Flatstock Volume One presents an editorial and visual history of Flatstock—the American Poster Institute’s ongoing, nomadic series of rock poster exhibitions. Since its inception in 2002, Flatstock has evolved into the definitive showcase for the most heralded and innovative poster artists working today, among them Yee-Haw studio and Jason Munn, for bands such as Modest Mouse, Wilco and Spoon. This deluxe volume chronicles the first 20 Flatstock exhibitions, which took place in some of the most exciting cities for music in America—from San Francisco and Austin to Chicago and Seattle. Featuring 566 color photographs of posters, as well as texts by important collectors, bands, critics and the artists themselves, among them Rock Paper Show: Flatstock Volume One takes the reader on a behind-the-scenes look at the places and personalities at the heart of this vibrant and varied community.

A Collection of $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{7}}$ -inch Records from the USA Edited by Brian Roettinger, Michael Treff, Diego Hadis. Introduction by Henry H. Owings. Text by Tom Hazelmyer, Sam McPheeters, Kristen Thompson.  

In an era that advocates streamlined product and music at the click of a mouse, Touchable Sound celebrates those independent-spirited bands and musicians who make their own records, relishing the opportunity to produce labor-intensive one-off artifacts with no prospect of remuneration. As Henry H. Owings puts it in his introduction, it is a book that honors “those that invest countless hours to further their art… It’s about having an attention to detail and a disinterest in the bottom line.” Curated by Brian Roettinger, Michael Treff and Diego Hadis, and organized by region across the U.S., Touchable Sound focuses on rare, labor-intensive, exquisite and unique examples of American seven-inch record design spanning nearly 25 years, lovingly documenting the obscure and the hardto-find with the help of musicians, artists and designers. Many of these records—by bands such as Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Chromatics, Fast Forward, Nuzzle, Gogogo Airheart, Young Ginns, Men’s Recovery Project, Angel Hair, Universal Order—have never previously been seen by a wide audience and were originally pressed in extremely limited runs. Editorial contributors include Henry Owings (Drug Racer Records, Chunklet magazine), Sam McPheeters (Vermiform Records), Tom Hazelmyer (Amphetamine Reptile Records), Kristin Thompson (Simple Machines Records) and more. Designed by Brian Roettinger, the book contains photographs of every record documented.

# The Beautiful & The Damned Punk Photographs by Ann Summa Edited by Kristine McKenna. Foreword by Exene Cervenka.  

When photographer Ann Summa arrived in Los Angeles in 1978, the city’s punk scene was still fresh, diverse, smart, utterly original—and fertile territory for a young photographer. The Beautiful & the Damned is a collection of her portraits of the musicians, artists and fans who made Los Angeles such a crucial part of the history of punk. Taken between 1978 and 1984, the images mostly revolve around L.A.’s first punk generation, and include portraits of the Germs, the Screamers, X, the Cramps and the Gun Club, among many others. From there, the book expands its scope to accommodate the cross-pollination that took place between L.A.’s punk scene and the fine art community, (at the time, the audience for avant-garde artists such as the Kipper Kids, Johanna Went and Laurie Anderson was primarily drawn from the underground music scene), and the two other cities—London and New York—that played a central role in the birthing of punk. Photographed during their first U.S. tours are U.K. groups the Clash, Magazine, the Fall, the Slits, Bow Wow Wow and the Pretenders, among others. Visiting dignitaries from New York include Television, James Chance, Lydia Lunch and Talking Heads. Also included are portraits of artists who served as an inspiration to L.A. punks—Captain Beefheart, Iggy Pop and David Bowie, among others—plus candid shots of unidentified audience members. Edited and with an introduction by Kristine McKenna, The Beautiful & The Damned includes 95 previously unpublished images.  

Ann Summa studied photography in Japan. Her work has been regularly published for the past 30 years in publications including Artnews, Rolling Stone and The Los Angeles Times.

# Party With Me Punker Early 80s Southern California Hardcore Scene Photographs and text by Dave Markey, Jordan Schwartz.  

Filmmaker Dave Markey has been well known since the 1980s for his films and videos that featured early appearances by alternative-rock music icons such as Mud Honey, Meat Puppets, Nirvana and Sonic Youth, but even as a teenager he was documenting the artists around him. In 1982, with his best friend Jordan Schwartz, Markey founded We Got Power, a fanzine dedicated to covering the hardcore and punk music communities in their native Los Angeles. Their text and photographs captured the early punk spirit of Black Flag, the Minutemen, Suicidal Tendencies and Hüsker Dü, at the height of their powers, when these bands were still playing in dilapidated houses and abandoned buildings. With a teenager’s candor and affection, Party with Me Punker presents an intimate view of one of the most fertile moments in the history of alternative music.

# James Hamilton: You Should Have Heard Just What I Seen The Music Photography Edited by Thurston Moore.  

Throughout the heady years of New York’s 1960s and 70s music scenes, James Hamilton was on hand to observe and photograph some of the most significant bands, musicians and performances of the twentieth century. Serving as staff photographer for the Village Voice and Crawdaddy!, Hamilton photographed such musicians as James Brown, Captain Beefheart, Ornette Coleman, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, the Grateful Dead, John Fahey, Mick Jagger, Jethro Tull, Elvin Jones, the Kinks, Madonna, Charlie Mingus, Joni Mitchell, the Ramones, Gil Scott-Heron, Patti Smith, Sun Ra, Tom Verlaine and Stevie Wonder. In You Should Have Heard Just What I Seen, Hamilton opens up his archives for the first time, revealing across 300 pages a trove of previously unpublished blackand-white photographs—portraits, snapshots, sketches, contact sheets—of some of the most recognizable faces in music. Influential for several generations of budding photographers raised on his photographs, the work of James Hamilton is at last collected in this revelatory volume. As a young man in the late 1960s, James Hamilton met the legendary photographers Diane Arbus and Eugene Smith, and was inspired by them to document the changing skyline of New York City. As staff photographer for Harper’s Bazaar and the Village Voice, Hamilton recorded the fashion shows, events, protests and riots, happenings, concerts, poetry readings and art openings of that era, and throughout the 1970s, his photographs of musicians and celebrities began to appear in the pages of Crawdaddy! magazine. Later Hamilton joined The New York Observer and began working with filmmakers George Romero, Francis Ford Coppola, Wes Anderson, Bill Paxton and Noah Baumbach as on-set photographer.

Sonic Youth: Sensational Fix Edited by Roland Groenenboom. Text by Thurston Moore, Kim Gordon, Lee Ranaldo, Vikki Alexander, Jutta Koether, Mike Kelley, John Miller, Richard Hell, et al.  

The iconic postpunk band Sonic Youth is famed for blurring musical genres, veering from thundering rock to dismantled experimentalism, and expanding the possibilities of the electric guitar. “What we’re doing is always inventing itself. I have no terminology for it,” guitarist Thurston Moore observes. Moore and his bandmates Kim Gordon, Lee Ranaldo and Steve Shelley have also, over the course of 27 years since they first started playing together, more quietly engaged in multidisciplinary solo efforts and collaborations with visual artists, filmmakers, designers and other musicians. Numerous artists, from Richard Prince and Raymond Pettibon to Gerhard Richter have contributed artwork for Sonic Youth album covers, and Moore, Ranaldo and Gordon in particular have collaborated with visual artists; but the group has also produced a large amount of great ephemera over the decades. This comprehensive 784-page volume—which includes two 7-inch records with unpublished songs by each member, album covers, band portraits and documentary photos, many of which have never been published before—is a must for fans and anyone wanting to connect the dots between New York’s various scenes. It features writings by band members and contributions by a host of other luminaries, including Richard Hell, Mike Kelley, Jutta Koether, Alan Licht, Lydia Lunch and John Miller.

# Thurston Moore: In Silver Rain With a Paper Key  

# Text by Werner Spies, Peter-Klaus Schuster, Dietmar Dath, Thomas W. Gaethgens.  

After releasing two acclaimed solo LPs—1995’s Psychic Hearts (DGC/Geffen Records) and 2007’s Trees Outside the Academy (Ecstatic Peace Records)—Sonic Youth chief songwriter, singer and guitarist Thurston Moore now presents In Silver Rain with a Paper Key, a hardcover monograph containing two seven-inch vinyl records, as well as art, photographs, lyrics, poetry and other texts from Moore’s personal notebooks and visual archives. The songs featured on the two seven-inch records include new compositions by Moore such as “You’ve Lost Your Lover,” “Circulation” and “Blood.” All of these songs were recorded in western Massachusetts on a 12-string acoustic guitar, and continue Moore’s investigation of radical and personalized acoustic guitar, first heard on Trees Outside the Academy. With In Silver Rain with a Paper Key, Moore’s well-known work as a poet, bookmaker, artist and editor is at last united with his legendary guitar virtuosity and songwriting skills. This highly collectible book-record constitutes a superb statement of Moore’s many abilities.

L.A. artist Raymond Pettibon (born 1957) is now so well known for his blackly humorous hand-drawn chronicles of the American unconscious and the darker realms of the counterculture, that it’s hard to believe his first solo exhibition—at the David Zwirner Gallery in New York—was as recently as 1994. In fact, it was amid the foment of the Los Angeles punk and hardcore scene of the late 1970s that Pettibon’s marvelous pen-and-ink drawings first found their audience: he was closely associated with Black Flag and the SST record label, designing album covers and logos for Black Flag (and later for The Minutemen and Sonic Youth) and releasing many books of drawings—now extremely sought after— through SST. Although Pettibon’s art preceded the birth of the L.A. punk scene by a few years, his conjunctions of blackly humorous text and image were well suited to the themes and the iconography of that movement. Raymond Pettibon: Front Row Center affirms the artist’s earliest audience and contexts by focusing on his use of music-related subject matter, his own music, his work with bands and record labels and his fascination with the utopian ideals and the sad demise of hippie and punk culture.

Parallel to the film career for which he is justly admired, David Lynch (born 1946) has always worked as an artist, having trained in painting at the Corcoran School of Art and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in the mid-1960s. Lynch’s photographs, paintings, prints, drawings, and more recently, musical compositions, are an indispensable part of his oeuvre and frequently a source of inspiration for his films. Fans of such classics as Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive will readily conjure the director’s keen eye for lush but menacing neo-Surrealist tableaux, for instance, which are directly nourished by his artworks. Other hallmarks of the Lynchian style, such as cryptic messages and inscriptions, foreboding atmospherics and a famously left-field sense of humor likewise appear in the paintings, drawings and photographs collected in David Lynch: Dark Splendor—a landmark publication that reveals the breadth and accomplishment of his work in this realm. It contains such marvels as his matchbook drawings—pen-and-ink images of shrouded dreamscapes and interiors, inscribed on the inside of matchbooks—his wonderfully foreboding lithographs, in which scrawled captions jostle among murky figures, his photographs of industrial wastelands and his sinister paintings that incorporate materials and objects to further advance their gothic appeal. Dark Splendor presents these works in excellent reproductions, and will seduce fans of contemporary film and art alike.

# David Lynch: Lithos Text by Patrice Forest, Dominique Paini.  

The workshop of Item Editions is sequestered in a back courtyard off the Rue du Montparnasse in Paris, where artists from all around the world have lithographs made on Solnhofener stones. Here, with the help of the historic presses that have printed masterworks by such artists as Picasso, Matisse and Miró, a durable artistic continues today. Filmmaker, photographer, painter and printmaker David Lynch (born 1946) was captivated by this place and its history, when he first chanced across it in 2007: “I fell in love,” he declared. Since his earliest experiments with zinc plates and prints in black and red, Lynch has continued to labor away at Item Editions, recently producing large black-and-white lithographs by drawing directly onto the stone (rather than using the medium to create multiples of pre-existing drawings), experimenting with textures to draw figurative imagery out of abstract patterns, and adding captions to further elucidate their themes. The content of these lithographs clusters around themes familiar to Lynch fans: love, eroticism, dreams and death. David Lynch: Lithos collects all of Lynch’s work in this genre. A conversation between Dominique Païni, former director of the French Cinematheque and Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and the artist, provides further insight into Lynch’s process.

# Wim Wenders: Once  

Wim Wenders ranks among the greatest artistic minds of contemporary film: over the past 30 years his films have consistently demonstrated such clarity and sensitivity that they have transcended boundaries of language and nationality, finding a devoted audience worldwide. Wenders brings to this collection of photographic essays the same literary and cinematic talents, the same command of the art of storytelling that we find in his films. In the tradition of Paris, Texas and Faraway, So Close, the texts and pictures in Once weave ambiguous and moving narratives in fits of rhythmic prose and inventive imagery. Prefaced by Wenders’ poetic meditations on the metaphysics of photography and film, Once consists of short, autobiographical sketches relating Wenders’ experiences—both meaningful and apparently trivial—on his trips across the world scouting locations for his films, as well as photographs taken during these excursions. The resulting book is at once travel diary, photo album, and a series of short films or short stories—revealing the views and sentiments of an auteur inspired by the poetry of the eye and the melody of speech. Fascinating and revelatory, Once gives us a unique look at the universe Wenders has created out of the hidden pieces of everyday life.

R.A. McBride & Julie Lindow: Left in the Dark Portraits of San Francisco Movie Theatres Text by Katherine Petrin, Melinda Stone, Chi-hui Yang, Rebecca Solnit, Eddie Muller, D. Scott Miller, Liz Keim, Laura Horak, Sergio de la Mora, Elisabeth Houseman, Joshua Grannell, Sam Sharkey. In our age of Netflix and streaming videos, movie attendance continues its long decline, and cinema-going is becoming ever less of the collective experience Walter Benjamin so memorably described. Throughout the city of San Francisco, however, many theaters built between 1910 and 1950 are still standing, and some even remain in operation, serving as poignant reminders of Hollywood’s Golden Age and the social interactions that once came with movie-going. R.A. McBride’s lush color photographs—made with film cameras, of course—showcase these temples to celluloid in all their threadbare grandeur. Photographed empty, the buildings’ architectural qualities, from rotunda chandeliers and warmly glowing walls to drab lobbies and worn armrests, come to the fore. Essays by scholars and film exhibitors including Rebecca Solnit, Julie Lindow, Eddie Muller, Chi-Hui Yang and Gary Meyer cast light from personal and scholarly perspectives, examining the movie houses’ roles as characters in the cultural drama of the city.

# Julian Schnabel: Art and Film Introduction by David Moos. Afterword by Julian Schnabel.  

Every day I make art, whether it is painting, writing or making a movie.  

—Julian Schnabel.  

American art megastar Julian Schnabel (born 1951) has made a métier of both painting and film, and while he is equally acclaimed for his achievements in each of these disciplines, the works have often been kept separate in the public eye. Yet Schnabel’s painting has drawn on cinematic imagery for years, often connecting otherwise disparate work via this theme, and his award-winning films have drawn on art both formally and as subject matter—most famously in the 1996 hit Basquiat. Schnabel himself resists categorization: “I make art,” he says, “whether it is painting, writing, photography or making a movie.” This survey of Schnabel’s career to date presents the artist’s painterly production, from the 1970s through to the present, juxtaposing his large-scale paintings with his numerous critically acclaimed movies—Basquiat (1996), Before Night Falls (2000), The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007) and his newest film Miral, which addresses the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The complete scripts of each of these movies are featured, punctuated with stills chosen by Schnabel. Published for the Art Gallery of Ontario’s 2010 survey, Julian Schnabel: Art and Film is the first appraisal of how Schnabel works across media, bridging painting, writing and cinema. Julian Schnabel was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. His first solo show was at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston in 1976, but it was with his 1979 exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York that Schnabel first asserted his presence as a figurehead for new possibilities in painting. Retrospectives of his work have been mounted by Tate Gallery, London $(1983)$ , the Whitney Museum of American Art (1987), and Museo Nacionale Centro de Arte Reina Sophia, Madrid (2004), among many others. He made his cinematic debut in 1996 with his account of the life of Jean-Michel Basquiat, which starred Jeffrey Wright, David Bowie, Gary Oldman and Dennis Hopper. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly earned him Best Director both at the Cannes Film Festival and the Golden Globes, and an Academy Award nomination in this same category.

# Barry McGee Edited by Aaron Rose.  

# Previously Announced  

# DAMIANI  

Barry McGee’s art buzzes with an infectious street vitality that celebrates the rich pageant of city living, while lambasting its “ills, overstimulations, frustrations, addictions.” His early years as a graffiti artist, tagging on the streets of San Francisco under such monikers as Ray Fong, Twist and Twisto, still nourish his drive to inscribe the blank face of modern life with the personal and the handmade. A part of the early 1990s art and graffiti boom associated with San Francisco’s Mission School (others include Clare Rojas, Chris Johanson and Aaron Noble) and with the Beautiful Loser generation, McGee synthesizes a wide range of resources, including the Mexican muralists, anonymous street art and San Francisco Beat poetry, all of which are notably characterized by a sense of public address that McGee never neglects to convey in his own work. His paintings, drawings and installations spill over with graphic energy and political anger, and direct exhortations to his audience to respond to the life around them. This hardcover artist’s book takes the form of a visual collage, incorporating photographs, drawings, paintings and documentation of past and present installations. It is the definitive volume on a much-loved artist.  

Barry McGee was born in San Francisco in 1968 and studied at the San Francisco Art Institute. He continues to live and work in that city. He has had solo exhibitions at Brandeis University’s Rose Art Museum in Waltham, Massachusetts, Deitch Projects in New York and the Watari Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo.

# Beautiful Losers: A Film by Aaron Rose  

The joy of making art with a community of friends, of building a scene purely out of passion and enthusiasm: this is the joy that suffuses Beautiful Losers, a heartening documentary about a loose-knit group of like-minded outsiders—young artists rooted in urban street cultures and underground scenes like skateboarding, graffiti, hip-hop and punk rock—who came together at a little storefront gallery in New York in the 1990s to make work that spoke to themselves and their friends, with little thought of the market. Companion to the now-classic book and show of the same name, Beautiful Losers features Shepard Fairey, Mark Gonzales, Spike Jonze, Margaret Kilgallen, Mike Mills, Barry McGee, Phil Frost, Chris Johanson, Harmony Korine and Ed Templeton; the film is directed by Aaron Rose, the artist, writer and curator who ran the storefront Alleged Gallery from 1992 to 2002, helping launch the careers of many of the artists in the film.

# Ed Templeton: The Cemetery of Reason Edited by Thomas Caron. Text by Jean-Francois Chevrier, Carlo McCormick, Philippe Van Cauteren, Arty Nelson, Thomas Caron.  

Californian artist Ed Templeton (born 1972) delivers up his diagnosis of the contemporary human condition in a whirlwind of present-tense imagery, filtered through photographs, paintings and drawings. Over the past decade and a half, Templeton has built an oeuvre that closely tracks his day-to-day reality, recording life in the Southern Californian suburbs, his flawed family background, his life as a professional skateboarder, his milieu, the relationship between the artist and his muse (his wife Deanna) and much else. Templeton has also drawn deeply on artists such as Egon Schiele, Balthus, David Hockney, Larry Clark and Nan Goldin; as with their work, what begins as a very personal chronicle ultimately opens out onto grander horizons—in Templeton’s case, a broad meditation on the chaos and the joy of being human. The Cemetery of Reason is the first large monographic museum publication devoted to Templeton’s work. Presented as a mid-career retrospective accompanying a spring 2010 exhibition at the S.M.A.K. (Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst) in Ghent, Belgium, it combines and juxtaposes works in various media from the past 15 years with new works and series, all reproduced in 260 color images, thus providing the most comprehensive overview of Templeton’s work available.  

Born in 1972 and raised in the Orange County suburb of Los Angeles, Ed Templeton is a professional skateboarder, co-editor of the arts magazine ANP Quarterly, photographer and artist. His work was featured in the hugely successful traveling show Beautiful Losers.

# Text by Dr. Lakra, Gabriel Orozco.  

A refined woman gazes elegantly from the cover of a mid-twentieth-century Mexican magazine—its title, Blanca Sol, lays bare the publication’s Eurocentric character—but the cover girl’s loveliness is compromised by the penciled-in skull that replaces the right side of her face. In another image, a sleek gentleman who might otherwise be debonair becomes fearsome and fierce with the addition of a pattern of contoured lines, like Aztec facial tattoos, over his entire face. This is the work of Mexican artist Dr. Lakra, who superimposes mystical, ancient or funerary symbolism—gang tattoos, bones and skulls, Aztec warrior heads, spider webs, serpents and demons—onto vintage advertisements, girlie pinups, Japanese prints, baby dolls, cast skulls and the like, attaining an effect that resembles a Dia de los Muertos altar slyly erected in place of a kitchen table in the home furnishings section of a Mexico City department store. “In one way or another, the noncivilized human, the nonrefined, the primitive, is always being repressed, in a way that’s almost criminal,” Dr. Lakra, who also works as a tattoo artist, has said. “I think that through these themes you can define the essence of culture.” This lavishly illustrated volume contains 120 color images of Lakra’s work, plus a contribution from renowned Mexican artist Gabriel Orozco. Born Jerónimo López Ramírez in 1972, Dr Lakra is an artist and tattooist based in Oaxaca, Mexico. Lakra has shown his work internationally, at Tate Modern in London, The Drawing Center and Andrew Kreps Gallery in New York, The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston and elsewhere.

For early devotees of leather, rubber and vinyl fetish wear, Atomage magazine was the underground bible of the 1970s. Founded, designed and published by the English designer John Sutcliffe as a platform for his extraordinary talents as “a manufacturer of weatherproofs for lady pillion riders,” it quickly became a rallying point for explorers of every kind of fledgling clothing scene, functioning as both an instruction manual and a mirror. The experimental clothing showcased in its pages, including items made by the readers themselves, transformed a passion for a sexual proclivity into a cult phenomenon. From motorbiking and mask-wearing, to mudlarking and wading worship, Atomage covered every conceivable variant on and use for fetish wear. The amateur photographs reproduced here reflect a golden age of DIY enthusiasm, before fetish became the industry it is today, and inadvertently depict a suburbia from which dressing for pleasure was a necessary escape. The outrageous costumes found in Atomage also served as inspiration to a then-new generation of fashion designers such as Vivienne Westwood, and many of these costumes have since been acquired by high-end collections. Compiling the most astonishing imagery from all $32$ issues of this now extremely rare and sought after cult magazine, Dressing for Pleasure illustrates not just Sutcliffe’s exceptional designs, but also, through their own photography and writings, the fantasies and desires of the Atomage followers.

# Danzig Baldaev: Drawings from the Gulag Edited by Damon Murray, Stephen Sorrell.  

Drawings from the Gulag consists of 130 drawings by Danzig Baldaev (author of the acclaimed Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia series), describing the history, horror and peculiarities of the Gulag system from its inception in 1918. Baldaev’s father, a respected ethnographer, taught him techniques to record the tattoos of criminals in St. Petersburg’s notorious Kresty prison, where Danzig worked as a guard. He was reported to the K.G.B. who unexpectedly offered support for his work, allowing him the opportunity to travel across the former U.S.S.R. Witnessing scenes of everyday life in the Gulag, he chronicled this previously closed world from both sides of the wire. With every vignette, Baldaev brings the characters he depicts to vivid life: from the lowest “zek” (inmate) to the most violent tattooed “vor” (thief), all the practices and inhabitants of the Gulag system are depicted here in incredible and often shocking detail. In documenting the attitude of the authorities to those imprisoned, and the transformation of these citizens into survivors or victims of the Gulag system, this graphic novel vividly depicts methods of torture and mass murder undertaken by the administration, as well as the atrocities committed by criminals upon their fellow inmates.  

Danzig Baldaev was born in 1925 in Ulan-Ude, Buryatiya, Russia. In 1948, after serving in the army in World War II, he was ordered by the N.K.V.D. to work as a warden in the infamous Leningrad prison, Kresty, where he started drawing the tattoos of criminals. His collection of drawings, which he made in different reformatory settlements for criminals all over the former U.S.S.R. over a period of more than 50 years, have been published by Fuel in three volumes, in the bestselling Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia series.

# Know Your Rodent  

# Text by Ziggy Hanaor. Illustrations by Thibaud Herem.  

Insects, fishes, birds: London-based French illustrator Thibaud Herem has made charming books devoted to these facets of the animal kingdom, depicting standout species in whimsical, personable drawings, rendered simply in black ink and watercolor. In his work, each animal displays its characteristic traits while also looking for all the world like it might turn and start speaking to the viewer at any moment. For his next book, it was only natural that Herem would move up another rung on the evolutionary ladder to those most lowly and mistrusted of mammals: rodents. Yet Know Your Rodent just may change a few people’s minds about the furry creatures. It turns out that there’s a lot more to rodents than subway rats, kitchen mice and the ubiquitous short-lived childhood gerbil. Out of the thousands of rodent species that scamper over nearly every habitat on earth, Herem has picked 20 distinctive varieties to depict here, from the giant Capybara of South America to the tiny Pygmy Jerboa of the Asian deserts. Factual texts describe the weird and wonderful habits of each creature, while Herem’s illustrations bring the animals alive on the page. At once fascinatingly informative and oddly humorous, this offbeat little book brings together the marvels of nature and the marvels of beautiful design in a way that will appeal to adults and children alike.

# Carlos Amorales: Caca Grande Jason Logan: Festus  

Poop in the air, poop in the trees, poop on your chin, poop on your knee: Mexican artist Carlos Amorales’ children’s book revels in the stuff, rendering these scenes in bold, scatological brown and black silhouette. Amorales (born 1970) has already established an impressive reputation as an artist working in a variety of media—animation, performance, video, sculpture, photography and works on paper—and here explores that singular niche within artists’ publications: the artist’s book sort of for children and definitely for adults. Caca Grande plays fast and loose with the brown stuff, dispatching it to places it had previously never been, with joyous abandon.

In Festus, Canadian artist and illustrator Jason Logan depicts the classic figure of the frontiersman in various incarnations. Logan made these works while traveling to the Klondike Institute in the outer reaches of Yukon, by the Alaska border, and they reflect the rugged landscape of the Canadian northwest; traces of Basquiat, too, are visible in the faces, sometimes seemingly rendered in finger paint. Thirty-five variations on the frontiersman—as hustler, magician, logger—make up this slender gem of a book.

The Man Who Refused to Die By Nicolas Ancion. Edited by Daniele Riviere. Illustrations by Patrice Killoffer. Afterword by Francois Taddei.  

Is death necessarily inevitable? The Man Who Refused to Die is the improbable tale of an intransigent character, heroic in his defiance, who refuses to cast aside mortal existence without knowing why he cannot prolong it indefinitely— who refuses to die just because the rest of humanity has thus far failed to avoid such a fate. The Belgianborn, French-based writer and comic-book critic Nicolas Ancion (author of L’homme qui valait 35 milliards) and the artist and illustrator Patrice Killofer (Futuropolis, Psikopat, 676 Apparitions of Killofer) draw on the researches of the molecular geneticist François Taddei for this latest installment in Dis Voir’s new series of “illustrated fairy tales for adults,” which asks “How do literature and science contaminate one another?”—seeking to mobilize scientific research to provoke dreams and meditations on the laws of the universe.

# Julie Doucet & Michel Gondry: My New New York Diary  

In 2008, the famed director Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Green Hornet, You’ll Like This Film Because You’re In It) wrote to legendary cartoonist Julie Doucet (of My New York Diary fame) to propose that they make a film together. Little did Gondry and Doucet know that the process itself would be the film, and they’d soon be starring in a “reality” comic and film of their own devising. They settled on a process that involved inserting the “real” Julie into a landscape of her own drawings. After meeting and filming with Gondry in Brooklyn, Doucet returned to her native Montreal and created dozens of drawings for the scenery, while Gondry, in New York, worked on editing the footage itself. Over time, these two elements were combined, and the result is a magical, funny and touching 20-minute film. My New New York Diary contains all of Doucet’s drawings for the film, as well as the DVD containing the film itself. Both the film and Doucet’s graphic novella are being released only in this deluxe, hardcover volume from PictureBox, which does full justice to the richness and warmth of Doucet and Gondry’s collaboration.

Renée French, an acclaimed graphic novelist and Inkpot Award winner at San Diego’s Comic-Con International, has entranced legions of fans with her twisted, highly inventive pencil drawings, whose agile lines and delicate shading open up strange imaginary vistas. She’s been called “an inimitable and masterful stylist, a kind of Edward Gorey who draws out the whimsical side of body-horror,” and indeed, the spirit of Gorey’s grotesques breathes through French’s creations. In H Day, her first graphic novel in four years, French explores, through metaphor and in pictures, her struggles with migraine headaches, marshaling troops of insects, beasts and humanoids to envision the processes that result in such hideous sensations. A sweeping, often tense narrative of invasion, repulsion and liberation, H Day can be read both as an oblique autobiography and as a suspenseful fantasy story. This volume makes clear the qualities that led Myla Goldberg, author of Bee Season, to call Renée French “that rare gift among artists—one whose work finds its way into the most guarded corners of our psyches and allows us to revel in all that is awkward, embarrassing or sticky about being alive.”

# Yuichi Yokoyama: Garden  

A group of friends is attempting to enter a garden just beyond a wall. When they succeed, the garden they finally enter is no Eden, but rather a massive landscape of machines, geometric forms and all manner of nonorganic objects. In Japanese comic-book artist Yuichi Yokoyama’s newest and longest (at 328 pages) work of graphic magic, his characters become enmeshed in a fantastic wonderland of distorted mirrors, photographic equipment, massive libraries and complex pathways. To his signature vivid visual style, Yokoyama has added more dialogue than in past works, fleshing out the characters and allowing them equal billing with his spectacular architectural creations, thus yielding a reflection on the myriad ways human interact with the complex mechanical world we have created. Douglas Wolk, writing in The New York Times Book Review, declared that “few cartoonists of the moment are weirder or more original than Yuichi Yokoyama.”

# Lament in the Night By Sh¯osun Nagahara.  

Lament in the Night collects two remarkable novellas by the author Sho¯sun Nagahara, translated from the Japanese for the first time. The title novella, originally published in $^{1925,}$ follows itinerant day laborer Ishikawa Sazuko as he prowls the back alleys and bathhouses of Los Angeles, looking for a meal, a job or just someone to hold onto. The second novella follows a young mother working her way through bars and nightclubs after being abandoned by her gambling-addicted husband. Written in a deadpan tone that is both evocative and precise, this dazzling exercise in 1920s naturalist noir promises to become a classic of American literature. This first-ever English language publication of Lament in the Night opens up a whole realm of American literature that has been woefully underpublished and unexplored—namely, the literary heritage of non-Englishspeaking immigrants in America. Nagahara was influenced by many Western writers—especially Knut Hamsun, whose work he translated into Japanese—and his novels combine the gritty sensibility of Los Angeles noir with elements of Japanese traditional storytelling and epistolary techniques.

# Migritude By Shailja Patel.  

The U.S. debut of internationally acclaimed poet and performance artist Shailja Patel, Migritude is a tour-de-force hybrid text that confounds categories and conventions. Part poetic memoir, part political history, Migritude weaves together family history, reportage and monologues to create an achingly beautiful portrait of women’s lives and migrant journeys undertaken under the boot print of Empire. Patel, who was born in Kenya and educated in England and the U.S., honed her poetic skills in performances of this work that have received standing ovations throughout Europe, Africa and North America. She has been described by the Gulf Times as “the poetic equivalent of Arundhati Roy” and by CNN as “the face of globalization as a people-centered phenomenon of migration and exchange.” Migritude includes interviews with the author, as well as performance notes and essays.

One overcast weekend in October 1974, Georges Perec set out in quest of the “infraordinary”: the humdrum, the non-event, the everyday—”what happens,” as he put it,“when nothing happens.” His choice of locale was Place Saint-Sulpice, where, ensconced behind first one café window, then another, he spent three days recording everything to pass through his field of vision: the people walking by; the buses and driving-school cars caught in their routes; the pigeons moving suddenly en masse; a wedding (and then a funeral) at the church in the center of the square; the signs, symbols and slogans littering everything; and the darkness that finally absorbs it all. In An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris, Perec compiled a melancholic, slightly eerie and oddly touching document in which existence boils down to rhythm, writing turns into time and the line between the empirical and the surreal grows surprisingly thin.

# Yves Klein by Himself His Life and Thought By Klaus Ottmann.  

Yves Klein (1928–1962) was an agitator of ideas, a “total artist” who used his considerable charisma to propagate social change through art. In his writings and talks, Klein drew on a vast repertoire of philosophical, scientific, political and occult materials, synthesizing them into a declamatory propaganda for his own art. Yves Klein by Himself is a composite biography of one of the most influential artists of the second half of the twentieth century. Neither an intellectual biography nor an art-historical analysis, Yves Klein by Himself is rather a kind of “Klein reader” that lets the artist speak through his ideas and philosophical conceptions, and in doing so attempts to reconstruct his “organized network of obsessions.” To this end, it intermixes biographical facts, a selection of texts by the writers and artists who influenced Klein, a glossary of keywords with Klein’s own definitions derived from published texts as well as previously unpublished manuscripts and a selection of critical writings with analyses of Klein’s philosophical ideas by the author and editor of this volume, Klein scholar Klaus Ottmann.

# Water Chasing Water New and Selected Poetry By Koon Woon  

Described by Bob Holman as “Li Po in drag, the voice of New America,” Koon Woon exploded onto the poetry scene in the late 1990s. Largely selftaught, and struggling with both mental illness and homelessness, Seattle-based Woon wrote about the back alleys and tenement rooms on the margins of immigrant culture. His first collection, The Truth in Rented Rooms (included in this volume), won a PEN poetry prize and earned praise from Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Garrison Keillor. Water Chasing Water is Woon’s second collection, and continues his exploration of loneliness and memory with poems and essays that seek out “This light / Without which existence is not detectable.”

# The Book of Disquiet By Fernando Pessoa. Translated and with an Introduction by Alfred Mac Adam.  

The eternal mystique of Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa (1888–1935) stems largely from his practice of writing under “heteronyms.” More than just nom de plumes, Pessoa’s heteronyms came with distinct biographies, careers, life spans, even horoscopes. In The Book of Disquiet, Pessoa came as close as he ever would to autobiography. Left on disordered scraps of paper in a trunk, the fragments that make up The Book of Disquiet record in disjunct entries a vast interior landscape and daily minutiae, making for a discontinuous, gently unhinged monologue in daybook form.

Few twentieth-century artists have been as quotable as the ever-pithy composer, writer, philosopher and artist John Cage, and his aphorisms have become the mantras of fans the world over.“I have nothing to say/and I am saying it/and that is poetry as I know it” is just one of his most famous observations, regularly cited by artists and thinkers across all disciplines. Celebrating Cage’s gift for playful, concise wisdom, and produced by the John Cage Trust under the guidance of Laura Kuhn, the John Cage Book of Days is a 2011 pocket calendar that brings together the composer’s words with noteworthy historical events in Cage’s life as well as tiny visual fragments drawn from his artworks. Bound in a soft cover graced with one of his essential Ryoanji drawings, this Book of Days gathers all aspects of Cage’s work into a volume that makes even the mundane task of managing a life pleasurable and fresh.

# A New World Imagined Text by Elliot B. Davis, Erica E. Hirshler, Gerald W.R. Ward.  

A New World Imagined proposes a bold new look at the art of the Americas by viewing it through its intersections and relationships with the world at large. Taking the vast geography and staggering cultural diversity of the North and South American continents as its starting point, the book introduces the ways in which American art, broadly defined, has been shaped both by its encounters with cultures around the globe and by its own past—from the ancient and native populations that first inhabited these territories to the European, Asian, Scandinavian and Latino émigrés who settled here. But beyond actual immigration, foreign cultures—especially the strikingly different cultures of Asia and the Islamic world—have also impacted our own in purely imaginary ways, as American artists projected their fantasies and preconceptions on these far-off lands and “imported” their motifs, infusing their work with a rich, wholly invented and thoroughly American vision of the “other.” Discussing over 200 artworks, from incense burners and painted drinking vessels to some of this country’s most celebrated paintings and sculptures, and coinciding with the opening of MFA Boston’s new Art of the Americas wing, A New World Imagined offers an alternate history of the Americas through the diverse inspirations and interactions through which its art has been fashioned.

December/Art  

Born of creative impulses dating back to the Ancient Americas, forged by necessity, and in many cases overlaying imported and appropriated traditions and motifs—whether familiar, misperceived, or fashioned from whole cloth—the art of the Americas showcases the combination of assimilation and invention that characterizes the rich fabric of our culture today. —Elliot Bostwick Davis, from the Introduction

# Memories of a Lost World Travels through the Magic Lantern Edited and with text by Charlotte Fiell.  

An early version of the slide projector and an immediate predecessor of narrative cinema, the magic lantern provided the lens through which late-nineteenth century Europe viewed and imagined the world. Magic lantern slide shows were a popular, entertaining and educational way for people to learn about the world beyond their own horizons, and from Cairo and Delhi to Adelaide and Cape Town, intrepid European photographers traveled to all corners of the world to document its peoples and customs. Now, for the first time, images of original magic lantern slides have been brought together in a single publication. Memories of a Lost World: Travels through the Magic Lantern takes the reader back to a pre-globalized world in which regional customs and national cultures were as distinctive as they were diverse. From the bustling streets of Victorian London and the ruins of ancient Egypt to the temples of Japan and the tribesmen of New Guinea, Memories of a Lost World explores the world through a captivating collection of over 800 magic lantern slide images. This volume is not only an important source of primary historical information, but also conveys something of what the world was like before the advent of television and mass travel.

Around the turn of the century, Magic Lantern slideshows were a popular entertainment in which Europeans learnt about the diverse landscapes, cultures and peoples of the world. Often accompanied by readings and music, magic lantern slides offered audiences tantalizing glimpses of the world beyond their shores.

# FRAENKEL GALLERY  

# Furthermore Edited by Jeffrey Fraenkel.  

Every five years or thereabouts, the renowned Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco finds itself with a number of unrelated works of photography that stand out as special, and which ultimately get collected in one of the gallery’s award-winning and soughtafter quintannual publications. These publications, every one of which has been a masterpiece of photography publishing, and swiftly becomes a rarity, constitute a kind of ultimate connoisseur’s survey of photographic gems. As with previous anniversary publications, the present trove, collected in Furthermore, includes a fantastic collection of images by photographers unknown, such as “an X-ray of a change purse, a Polaroid from a prison yard, a collage of the moon’s surface radioed to earth from an unmanned spacecraft”—all of which appear, as usual, alongside “several dozen photographs made by serious artists with complicated intentions.” Among those serious artists are Diane Arbus, Andy Warhol, Robert Adams, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Sol LeWitt, Lee Friedlander, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Richard Misrach and Irving Penn. Marking the Fraenkel Gallery’s thirtieth anniversary, Furthermore is designed by Katy Homans and printed with extraordinary fidelity by Meridian Printing. The cover reproduces the only known print of Morton Schamberg’s 1918 Dada masterpiece,“God.” Furthermore is a meditation on the inexplicable essence of the medium, and an essential new publication for anyone who cares seriously about art and photography. Jeffrey Fraenkel opened Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco in 1979. Since that time the gallery has presented almost 300 exhibitions spanning the history of photography. Fraenkel has authored or edited more than a dozen books investigating aspects of the medium, including The Eye Club, Edward Hopper & Company and The Book of Shadows.

# Praha, Paris, Barcelona Photographic Modernity 1918–1948 Edited by David Balsells. Text by Maite Ocaña, David Balsells, Jan Mlcoch, Quentin Bajac, Juan Naranjo, Salvador Dalí.  

Examining the revolution in photography that took place across Europe between 1918 and 1945, this enormous and bold survey orients its examination of the era around three cities, each of which served as a nexus for major developments in the medium: París, Prague and Barcelona. Until the First World War, photography had largely followed the aesthetics of painting; during and after the war, such movements as Constructivism, Moholy-Nagy’s New Vision and Surrealism led photography to new frontiers, developing techniques and styles that took the medium strictly on its own terms. Demonstrating the interconnectedness of these tendencies, this volume assesses the contributions of each of these cities. Photographers based in Paris during these years include Man Ray, Brassai, Emmanuel Sougez, Hans Bellmer, Jacques-André Boiffard, Germaine Krull, André Kertész, François Collar, Claude Cahun, Florence Henri, Andreas Feininger, Eli Lotar, Dora Maar, Roger Parry and Raul Ubac; in Prague, Josef Sudek, Frantisek Drtikol, Jaroslav Rössler, Eugen Wiskovsk, Jaromír Funke, Karel Teige, Ladislav Berka, Jan Lauschmann, Josef Bartuska, Jindrich Styrsky and Karel Kasparik; and in Barcelona, Pere Català Pic, Josep Masana, Josep Sala, Josep Lladó, Emili Godes, Antoni Arissa, Gabriel Casas, Salvador Dalí and Joaquim Gomis.

# Frantisˇek Drtikol Edited by Annette Kicken, Rudolf Kicken. Text by Anna Fárová, Vladimir Birgus.  

Czech photographer Frantiˇsek Drtikol (1883–1961) reinvented the genre of nude photography for the early twentieth century. Drtikol opened his Prague studio in 1907, and his nudes from this early period convey the dreamy eroticism of Art Nouveau and the foreboding accents of Prague Symbolism that he was to return to throughout his somewhat brief career (Drtikol abandoned photography for painting in 1935, and it was not until curator Anna Fárová’s now legendary 1972 Prague exhibition that this work was rediscovered by a broader public). But Drtikol quickly absorbed into his photography the myriad new idioms of the interbellum years, and freighted his nudes with the dramatic lighting of silent film and the more austere geometric effects and dynamic poses of Futurism, Cubism and Bauhaus. Surveying his daring and expressive nudes of the 1920s and 1930s, this important publication charts Drtikol’s adventurous treatments of the nude as they evolved in their quirky conversation with modernist innovations—from the early nymphs and femme fatales to more abstracted studies that dramatize light and kinetic qualities.This smartly conceived volume confirms Drtikol’s place as one of the greatest photographers of the early twentieth century.

# Heinrich Kühn: Perfect Photography Text by Monika Faber, Astrid Mahler.  

German scientist and photographer Heinrich Kühn ( $1866-1944)$ was one of the central figures in the establishment of international art photography at the turn of the twentieth century. Having studied botany and medicine, Kühn made his first photograph in the late $18705,$ dedicating himself solely to the medium within a decade. He achieved this dedication through the support of American photographers Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen and others. After a meeting in 1904, Stieglitz and Kühn initiated an almost 30-year-long correspondence, ushering in an era of pioneering experimentation with autochrome and other photographic processes. Critical to Kühn’s success was an offset process he perfected, which allowed him to deliberately dissolve the sharpness of the image and alter its brightness. The results are gorgeous, dreamy images full of rich, delicate color. Around 1910, Kühn reduced the romantic cosmos of Pictorialism to the point where his compositions became almost abstract, so that only the study of light and the rendering of tonal values mattered. He later returned to exploring the photograph as objective record, concentrating mainly on writing and to experiments in photographic technology. This landmark volume surveys the works of a revelatory photographer.

# Nadav Kander: Yangtze, The Long River Text by Jean Paul Tchary.  

The Yangtze river flows 4,100 miles across China, traveling from its furthest westerly point in the Qinghai province to Shanghai in the east. The river is embedded in the consciousness of the Chinese, and plays a significant role in both the spiritual and physical life of the people. Using the river as a metaphor for constant change, Nadav Kander (born 1961) has photographed the landscape and people along its banks from mouth to source. “After several trips to different parts of the river, it became clear that what I was responding to and how I felt whilst being in China was permeating into my pictures,” he records; “a formalness and unease, a country that feels both at the beginning of a new era and at odds with itself.”

# Ruhr Views  

# New German Photography Text by Thomas Weski.  

Ruhr Views presents portraits of the Ruhr valley region in West Germany by 11 internationally renowned cross-generation photographers: Bernd and Hilla Becher, Laurenz Berges, Joachim Brohm, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Andreas Gursky, Jitka Hanzlová, Candida Höfer, Matthias Koch, Elisabeth Neudörfl, Jörg Sasse and Thomas Struth. All of these photographers had made work in the Ruhr previously, and selected their own subjects to photograph for this volume (some of which related to previous projects); all of the photography (save that of Bernd and Hilla Becher) is published here for the first time, and offers new perspectives on today’s Ruhr metropolis. Sigrid Schneider’s essay “Retrospectives: The Ruhr in Photographs” offers insights into the myths and character of the Ruhr, and Thomas Weski provides a detailed introduction to the participating artists and their work and describes their various working methods.

# David T. Hanson: Colstrip, Montana Introduction by Rick Bass. Essay by David T. Hanson.  

Over the past 30 years, American photographer David T. Hanson has scoured the American landscape for telltale signs of the way we live now— what we do with our land and how we live on it. Colstrip, Montana, is the site of one of the largest coal strip-mines in North America. Between 1982 and 1985, Hanson undertook a photographic investigation of the mine, power plant and industrial site. The Colstrip, Montana sequence was first exhibited by John Szarkowski at The Museum of Modern Art in 1986. This book publishes the entire series for the first time.

A European analogue to Mitch Epstein’s stirring project American Power, Jürgen Nefzger’s (born 1968) photographic series Fluffy Clouds likewise depicts tranquil landscapes with the apparatus of atomic power looming just behind. In Nefzger’s idyllic views of Europe, sheep graze on hilly meadows, bathers sun themselves at the beach and a lone fisherman contemplates a riverbank— but cooling towers and nuclear reactors are never far away, sometimes overtly visible, sometimes only hinted at. Fluffy Clouds critiques the atomic energy PR image of a halcyon world in harmony with the use of nuclear energy.

# Ralf Peters: Until Today Edited by Bernhard Knaus. Text by Klau  

Götz Diergarten (born 1972) developed his rigorous, typological approach to photography under the tutelage of Bernd and Hilla Becher. Diergarten documents European vernacular architecture: storefront façades, beach cabanas, spas and metro stations in Germany, France, England and Belgium. His instinct for color and texture adds a dimension of play to an otherwise austere conception, recalling the deadpan beauty of William Eggleston and Stephen Shore. In the absence of the human form, commonplace details like a door, window or street sign take on expressive personality—a testament to Diergarten’s ability to illuminate the commonplace.

# Philippe Chancel: Desert Spirit Text by Quentin Bajac.  

Between 2007 and 2009, photographer Philippe Chancel (born 1959) made several visits to the United Arab Emirates, and was astounded by the ubiquitous presence of bizarre artifice: the desert grows green, seawater is desalinated and new islands rise out of the sea. Moving from one air-conditioned space to another, from apartment to limousine, from limousine to shopping mall, from shopping mall to theme park, Chancel found irresistible images at every turn; in this volume he expounds the United Arab Emirates as the supreme expression of totalized consumerism.

# Renate Aller: Oceanscapes One View. Ten Years.  

Text by Richard B. Woodward, Petra Roettig, Jasmin Seck.  

German-born photographer Renate Aller has been photographing the Atlantic Ocean for over a decade, from a single point on the Long Island coastline. Her images capture the shifting colors and textures of the sky and water, and the grandeur of the ocean, and connect the sublime beauty of this Atlantic view to the nineteenth-century German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich, her static viewpoint likewise allowing for images that provoke infinite reverie.

# Laura Letinsky: After All Text by Mark Strand  

The setup is classic and familiar: a table draped with a white cloth, a dish of fruit, a sugar bowl. Yet instead of the meal awaiting an unseen viewer’s consumption, as in a classic still life, Laura Letinsky photographs what remains on the table after the food has been eaten, leaving only crumbs, melon rinds, a cantaloupe pocked with rot and a half-finished lollipop. Letinsky explores the inextricable relationship between ripeness and decay, delicacy and clumsiness, waste and plenitude, pleasure and sustenance. The influence of Dutch-Flemish and Italian still-life paintings— whose exacting beauty documented shifting social attitudes resulting from exploration, colonization, economics and ideas about seeing as a kind of truth—can be seen here as well. In After All, Letinsky explores photography’s transformative quality, changing what is typically overlooked into something splendid in its resilience. Poet Mark Strand contributes an essay to this marvelous volume.

# Dayanita Singh: House of Love Text by Aveek Sen.  

Dayanita Singh’s House of Love is a work of photographic fiction that takes the form of 13 short stories. The “House of Love” itself is the Taj Mahal, but the Taj Mahal as a recurring motif that stands for the truths and lies of night and day, love and illusion, attachment and detachment, humor and treachery. Through images of her native India, Singh creates her own mysterious and ineffable, strange yet familiar language, using her trademark black-and-white photography and her newer investigations of nocturnal color. Working closely with writer Aveek Sen, whose prose pursues its own parallel journey, Singh explores the relationship between photography and writing.

# John Gossage & Alec Soth: The Auckland Project  

In the spring of 2009, John Gossage and Alec Soth were invited to photograph in Auckland, New Zealand. For both, it was a trip of departures. Gossage has been working in black and white for over 40 years, and this trip yielded some of his first work in color. Soth’s work with the 8x10 view camera has inspired a more recent generation, and leaving it behind was key to attaining a fresh visual perspective. This publication presents the results of that trip. Essentially two books in one, The Auckland Project evinces the attention to book form that characterizes the publications of both photographers.

Perhaps America’s largest human creation, it has been vilified and celebrated in equal measure since its inception. With LA Day/LA Night, photographer Michael Light continues his aerial examination of the arid American West by bringing together two opposing views of the city in a double-volume set. LA Day stares directly into the sun, blasting the metropolis in a relentless blaze. LA Night drifts over the city as it grows darker, then begins to resemble the starry sky vaulted above.

# Jason Fulford: The Mushroom Collector  

# Edited by Lorenzo de Rita.  

As photographer Jason Fulford recently learned firsthand, mushrooms have a way of growing and spreading wherever they touch ground. It all started when a friend of Fulford’s gave him a box, bought at a flea market, full of photos of mushrooms—modest snaps taken by an unknown but almost certainly amateur photographer, apparently as notes for mycological studies. These mushroom images stuck in Fulford’s mind, and started to grow in his own work. The Mushroom Collector combines some of the original flea-market mushroom pictures with his own images and text by the artist about the project.

# Stephen Gill: Coming up for Air  

Dubbed by Martin Parr “the new whiz kid of British documentary,” Stephen Gill (born 1971) records the immediacies of city sights with airy specificity and lightness of touch. Gill’s latest volume, Coming Up for Air, collects work made in Japan in 2008 and 2009. Unlike previous volumes such as Hackney Flowers, these images minimize local information in favor of achieving what Gill calls “a kind of fictional aquatic world…. muffled chaos seen through squinted eyes.” A superb work of bookmaking, this volume consists of 100 color photographs that linger and pivot upon the lightest of effects.

# Stephen Gill: B Sides  

Just as a collection of a musician’s B-side cuts and outtakes, or the scenes that didn’t quite make it into a movie, speak volumes about the project as a whole, and offer their own kind of magic by their very excision, so too does B Sides, the companion volume to British photographer Stephen Gill’s latest book of photos Coming Up for Air, likewise illuminate the fringes of his latest project. In B Sides, Gill records minute effects of texture and trace. Please note that only a limited number of copies are available.

# Malerie Marder: Carnal Knowledge Edited by Robert Violette. Preface by Gregory Crewdson. Text by James Ellroy, Neville Wakefield, A.M. Homes, James Frey, Bruce Wagner. Interview with Philip-Lorca diCorcia.  

A seminal experience for American photographer Malerie Marder (born 1971) was a family friend’s request for Marder to photograph her with her lover, naked and in the anonymous setting of a motel room. This set the tone for Marder’s work for the next decade. Her photographs of nudes are composed simply, much like portrait painting, her subjects sitting plainly near the center of the frame, often set against the bleak anonymity of motel rooms, their impassive gazes almost daring the viewer to interpret their bodies. “Marder has explored the psychosexual undertow of her own intimate relationships,” Siobhan McDevitt wrote in Artforum, “frequently shooting herself along with family and friends in close quarters (including pay-by-the-hour motels) and, usually, undressed. She flirts with prurience, with ideas of privacy and surveillance, eroticism and pornography, but seems more satisfied when approaching the complications of love or being in love.” Beautifully illustrated, Carnal Knowledge contains $77$ color reproductions of these photographs, as well as new texts from James Ellroy and Neville Wakefield, a preface by Gregory Crewdson, short stories inspired by Marder’s work by A. M. Homes, James Frey and Bruce Wagner, and a Q & A for Marder devised by Philip-Lorca diCorcia. It is the first volume to collect these works and to bring Marder’s work to a wider audience.

# Sam Shaw  

# Text by Lorie Karnath.  

The image of Marilyn Monroe standing on a subway grate as her dress is blown above her knees—from The Seven-Year Itch is so deeply embedded in popular consciousness that it’s easy to forget a single stills photographer was responsible for it. The photographer’s name was Sam Shaw (1912–1999), and he portrayed virtually every major Hollywood star of his day—Marlon Brando (Shaw created the photograph of Brando in a ripped t-shirt for A Streetcar Named Desire), Paul Newman, Audrey Hepburn, Sidney Poitier, Monroe and countless others. Born and raised on New York’s Lower East Side, and closely identified with the city’s visual iconography, Shaw shot countless cover pictures for Life and Look in the 1950s and $6\infty5,$ and later also took the still photographs for movies that he produced himself, initially for Paul Newman on Paris Blues, but most notably for movies directed by John Cassavetes, including Husbands, A Woman Under the Influence, Opening Night, Gloria and Love Streams. This fantastic survey of Shaw’s work has been assembled and edited by Lorie Karnath, who contributes to the volume a personal remembrance of her longtime friend.

Just Loomis’ first photographs were made in the mid-1970s, recording the railway lines and the casinos of his birthplace in Reno, Nevada; they tell of the highs and lows of everyday life in the American West. A former assistant and friend of Helmut Newton’s, Loomis (born 1957) worked in the 1980s as a fashion photographer for magazines such as Harper’s Bazaar and The New York Times Magazine. Turning to portraiture and documentary photography in 1990, Loomis began to make portrait photographs, in both black and white and in color, that show a raw and affectionate view of everyday life in America: a waitress behind a counter in a Hollywood diner, a young couple exuding the bliss of early romance, or children caught in moments of play. From his earliest work through to this latest collection, the photographer’s first monograph, Loomis’ method has been to insist on the value and beauty of what lies immediately to hand, and to locate the moments that illuminate that fact for the viewer. As June Newton states,“He understands these people, as he comes from the same place. These pictures are without artifice of any kind… I call them a perfect example of Americana today.”

# The Portrait Unbound: Photographs by Robert Weingarten Text by Julian Cox.  

Traditional portraiture proceeds from the assumption that we can learn about a person by looking at their face. But crucial biographical truths are rarely visible on the surface. Robert Weingarten (born 1941) addresses this with The Portrait Unbound, in which his “portraits” of 21 eminent Americans— among them playwrights, musicians, scientists, architects and actors—show not physical appearances but the subjects’ memories and associations. Thus Stephen Sondheim is represented by musical staff paper and is superimposed on Seurat’s “La Grande Jatte,” and Colin Powell is figured in a somber composition based on the mausoleumesque slabs of the Vietnam War Memorial. Other subjects include Hank Aaron, Edward Albee, Buzz Aldrin, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Chuck Close, Frank Gehry, Jane Goodall, Billy Graham, Dennis Hopper, Quincy Jones, Carl Lewis, Sandra Day O’Connor, Alice Waters and James Watson. Includes a bonus DVD.

# Jeffrey Silverthorne: Directions for Leaving Photographs 1971–2006 Text by Annie Proulx, Cary Loren, Robert Frank.  

”Over the past 35 years,” writes Annie Proulx (author of Brokeback Mountain and The Shipping News) in her introduction to this retrospective look at the photographic oeuvre of Jeffrey Silverthorne (born 1946),“Silverthorne has photographed authority figures, nudes, prostitutes, prisoners, illegal immigrants, border bars and cheap hotel rooms, carnival denizens, people in the fringe worlds of American society, moribund animals, himself and the dead. He is internationally known for the postmortem genre he pioneered, photographs of the dead that shocked and repelled even as they fascinated.” Framed in stark and uncompromising compositions, Silverthorne’s subjects often regard the viewer with a defiant indifference; his work melds portraiture with a kind of detached photodocumentary impulse à la Diane Arbus. In exploring marginal characters and milieux, he confronts us with our own sense of disgust and the grotesque. This volume also includes a contribution by Robert Frank and an interview by Detroit rocker Cary Loren.

In Nuevo Laredo, just south of the U.S.–Mexico border, complexes of sex clubs called Boystowns cater to American men, and a few Mexicans, who wish to watch women take off their clothes and perhaps to pay for sex with one of them. Photographer Jeffrey Silverthorne (born 1946), who has in the past made photographs of landscapes, still lifes, portraits of transvestites and of dead bodies in a morgue, photographed the women who sell their bodies nightly in the Mexican establishments for wages that far exceed what they could earn in the local maquiladoras. Lurid and unsettling, Boystown: The Perfume of Desire presents $56$ color and $34$ black-andwhite images. “On a simplistic and juvenile level,” Silverthorne writes, “a Boystown is a celebration of life, a candy store of flesh, with any psychological or medical consequences deferred. On an adult level, Boystown is a direct observation of a spiritual poverty and economic failure that both countries and cultures share.”

# Stefan Ruiz: San Francisco Berlin  

# Introduction by Chris Boot.  

In photographer Stefan Ruiz’s San Francisco Berlin series, large-format portraits depict gay men dressed up for fetish-themed events in two cities that have played pivotal roles in defining gay male aesthetics. Shot in an improvised street studio, Ruiz’s pictures are documentary in feel, their subjects captured against blank backgrounds, leveling steady, implacable gazes at the viewer. Some pictures fulfill expectations of fetish sexuality, as in the shot of a dour-faced, tattooed man who is nude except for a thick metal chain sashing his torso and a black leather strap fastened around his genitals. Other subjects’ accoutrements are more playful—sleek black leather wrist cuffs abound, and one man sports a Batman face mask, complete with bat ears. With texts drawn from interviews with some of the subjects, and an introduction by Chris Boot (who curated the “Gay Men Play” exhibition for the New York Photo Festival in 2009), San Francisco Berlin is both a document of extreme fashion and a serious consideration of contemporary gay sexual identity.

# Christopher Makos: Lady Warhol  

This is not Andy Warhol as we are accustomed to seeing him: in dramatic eyeliner and mascara, an asymmetrical blond bob worthy of a Vogue cover circa 1987, his hands clutched girlishly at his upper thigh; or with a glisteningly lipsticked cupid’s bow, shadowed eyes downcast; or draped, from the armpits down, in a white sheet, his upper chest startlingly pale. In these portraits, made by Christopher Makos (born 1948), the gender-transgressive themes of the 1980s collide with the spirit of Man Ray’s famous “Rrose Sélavy” pictures of Marcel Duchamp as a coy Parisian lady. The project entailed, Makos recalls, “eight wigs, two days of posing, 16 contact sheets, 349 shots”; this volume includes Makos’ original contact sheets, an essay by the photographer about his friendship with Warhol, and full-page prints of the most striking images to emerge from one of Pop’s most singular photo shoots.

# Jim Naughten: Re-enactors Text by Bill Kouwenhoven, Mark Rappolt.  

Every summer thousands of people from all over the world gather in a Kentish field and leave the present firmly behind. They step out of their routine daily lives and transform into historical characters from the First and Second World Wars, often embracing their roles with such vigor and obsessive attention to detail that it is hard to imagine them outside of this fictitious combat zone. Taking on a different name, identity and sometimes even a different tongue, these roleplayers re-enact battles and drills from an imagined past to a degree that becomes something more than acting, a collective fantasy played out on a massive scale. London photographer Jim Naughten’s portraits of these re-enactors are shot formally, in three-quarter profile, usually from the legs up, against white backdrops—an effect that heightens the sense of artifice and anachronism. Beautifully bound and printed, this volume records a world apart from both past and present.

# Ron Jude: Emmett  

Jude’s latest book project, Emmett, brings new life to a selection of his own early photographs, made in the early 1980s in central Idaho. Enhanced by special-effects filters and cheap telephoto lenses, the pictures include hazy scenes of a summertime drag race, a forest across changing seasons, midnight horror films on TV and a Nordiclooking teenager who appears as a specter from the artist’s past. Edited here nearly 30 years after its making, this experimental body of work acquires unexpected nuance and humor, and has the serendipitous qualities of a dream—memories reorganized into a fictionalized narrative, imagery suffused with both an unsettling melancholy and the glow of youthful reverie. Related conceptually to and residing thematically between his two previous books—Alpine Star and Other Nature—Emmett achieves an aesthetic inspired by equal parts Motörhead and Jean-Paul Sartre.

Harmony Korine shocked a nation with his first movie script, 1995’s Kids, about drug-addled adolescents wallowing in ennui and sex. Arbiters of culture and morality wrung their hands, but two firsttime actors in Kids—Chloë Sevigny and Rosario Dawson—found longtime fame in the ensuing years. Korine himself went on to direct several audaciously polarizing feature films. This book, The Trash Humpers, is based on the photographic research for Korine’s latest directorial project of the same name. Released on lo-fi VHS and edited in part while blindfolded—or so Korine attests—the 78-minute movie follows a gang of miscreants who roam the streets of Nashville, molesting garbage bins and causing random mayhem. “It’s an ode to vandalism and the creativity of the destructive force,” Korine has said. “Sometimes there’s a real beauty to blowing things up, to smashing and burning. It could be almost as enlightening as the building of an object.”

# Trevor Paglen: Invisible Covert Operations and Classified Landscapes Text by Rebecca Solnit.  

Invisible: Covert Operations and Classified Landscapes is Trevor Paglen’s long-awaited first photographic monograph. Social scientist, artist, writer and provocateur, Paglen has been exploring the secret activities of the U.S. military and intelligence agencies—the “black world”—for the last eight years, publishing, speaking and making astonishing photographs. As an artist, Paglen is interested in the idea of photography as truth-telling, but his pictures often stop short of traditional ideas of documentation. In the series Limit Telephotography, for example, he employs high-end optical systems to photograph top-secret governmental sites; and in The Other Night Sky, he uses the data of amateur “satellite watchers” to track and photograph classified spacecraft in Earth’s orbit. In other works Paglen transforms documents such as passports, flight data and aliases of CIA operatives into art objects. Rebecca Solnit contributes a searing essay that traces this history of clandestine military activity on the American landscape.

# Malick Sidibé: La Vie en Rose  

Edited and text by Laura Incardona, Laura Serani.  

Acclaimed for his black-and-white photographs of 1960s youth culture in Bamako, Mali, Malick Sidibé (born 1936) is today the African continent’s best-known photographer. Sidibé was recently awarded the Venice Biennale Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement (2007)— the first time this award was presented to a photographer—and the Infinity Award for Lifetime Achievement (2008), in recognition of his contribution to documentary photography and the historical record. Malick Sidibé: La Vie en Rose provides a survey of this work, focusing primarily on Sidibé’s images of Mali’s buzzing youth culture and family life in Bamako in the 1960s and 70s. Laura Serani’s foreword contextualizes Sidibé’s work in a wider survey of African photography; the book also includes an interview with the photographer by Laura Incardona and an appendix with Sidibé’s famous “chemises” (photographic dossiers), which documents his working methods.

# A Useful Dream: African Photography 1960–2010 Edited and with an introduction by Simon Njami. Text by Frank Vanhaecke  

Photography has proved a particularly essential art in the African continent’s postcolonial era, both for recording the numerous seismic moments in its recent history, and for reclaiming the imagery of Africa from its colonial portrayers. As Africa has begun to step beyond its colonial subjugation, photography has also assumed a leading role in providing African countries with individual identities. Tracking the blossoming of postcolonial photography in Africa from 1960 to the present, and accompanying an exhibition at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, A Useful Dream: African Photography 1960–2010 celebrates 50 years of African photography. Among the 34 photographers gathered in its pages are Rui Assubuji, Nabil Boutros, Loulou Cherinet, James Depara, Samuel Fosso, David Goldblatt, Bob Gosani, Pierrot Men, Zwelethu Mtethwa, Eileen Perrier, Ricardo Rangel, Malick Sidibé and Patrice-Félix Tchikaya.

# In Our Own Image By Fred Ritchin.  

Twenty years ago, before the era of digital cameras, cell phones and the internet, Fred Ritchin outlined many of the ways in which the digital age would transform society. In Our Own Image was the first book to address “the coming revolution in photography,” and asked pointed questions that are increasingly relevant today, including whether democracy can survive the media’s facile use of digital means. By the time a second edition was published in 1999, many of Ritchin’s predictions had come true. Computer embellishment of imagery had become a staple in the media and had significantly diminished photography’s role as a credible witness: Newsday had published the first “future” news photograph of two feuding ice skaters as they would meet the next day, and on its cover, Time magazine darkened and blurred an image of O.J. Simpson in order to lift “a common police mug shot to the level of art, with no sacrifice to truth.” Now Aperture reissues this seminal text, which has continued to shape the debate about digital imaging since its initial publication. This twentieth-anniversary edition features a preface by the author that contextualizes the book for a contemporary audience. Fred Ritchin is Professor of Photography and Imaging at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. He was picture editor of The New York Times Magazine (1978–82) and the founding director of the Photojournalism and Documentary Photography Program at the International Center of Photography (1983–86). Ritchin is the author of After Photography (2009), as well as numerous essays and the blog afterphotography.org.

# Light Matters By Vicki Goldberg.  

Vicki Goldberg, one of the leading voices in the field of photography criticism, is well known for her cogent and perceptive writing, which is regularly featured in such national publications as The New York Times. First published in 2005, Light Matters gathers a selection of this remarkable author’s essays and criticism, culled from her writings published over the previous 25 years. Goldberg’s take on photography is both insightful and encompassing: her subjects range from pop imagery to war journalism, from photo-booth portraits to manipulated digital imagery, from the “boredom” of voyeurism to the great preponderance of tragic photographs in the news. She brings new light to the work of the medium’s “old masters,” among them Walker Evans, Lotte Jacobi and Lartigue, writing with equal acuity about contemporary trailblazers such as Bill Viola, Daido Moriyama and Bastienne Schmidt. Goldberg also tackles provocative larger issues facing the medium, such as the potentially transgressive nature of photographs, and the camera’s powerful role in a culture of commodification. Dismissing clichés and deftly negotiating the many diverging paths photography now follows, Goldberg demonstrates how to consider not just photographic images themselves, but their impact, and the meaning of that impact. Light Matters showcases a writer of great intelligence, wit and insight, whose understanding of this multifarious and evolving medium is unsurpassed.  

Vicki Goldberg is the author of numerous books, including The Power of Photography: How Photographs Changed Our Lives (1991). In 1997, she received the International Center of Photography’s prestigious Infinity Award.

# Plastic Dreams: Synthetic Visions in Design Text by Peter Fiell, Charlotte Fiell.  

Over the past 150 years, the role of plastics within the field of design has been fundamental to the development of the manmade environment. Synthetic polymers have quite literally molded the modern world, transforming utopian dreams into three-dimensional realities. Indeed, the impact of plastics has been felt in every area of human life, from healthcare and food distribution to communications, transportation and financial transactions. Plastic Dreams: Synthetic Visions in Design tells the fascinating story of these truly wondrous materials, charting their evolution from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, across a huge range of landmark product types, from Wells Coates’ iconic $\mathsf{A D65}$ radio to Konstantin Grcic’s MYTO stacking chair, and from Bakelite in the 1920s to today’s latest techno-polymers. A fully illustrated reference resource, this volume raises our aesthetic perception of plastics and celebrates their nobility as materials. An introductory essay traces the fascinating history of plastics and assesses their decisive role in industrial design, while an extensive glossary of materials and processes will help the plastics neophyte distinguish their Jaxonite and Xylonite from their polyethylene and ABS. As a final design flourish, Plastic Dreams comes with a specially designed orange plastic slipcase by Edson Matsuo of Melissa.

# Scott King Edited by Lionel Bovier. Text by Jon Savage.  

Scott King moves fluidly back and forth between art and design. As Art Director of i-D and Creative Director of Sleazenation magazines (for which he was awarded “Best Cover” and “Best Designed Feature of the Year” prizes), King’s design work is already well-known around the world. As an artist, King plays fast and loose with twentiethcentury icons: in “Brian,” for example, a viewer recognizes at a glance Lenin’s familiar visage, with the face turned sternly to the side, the moustache plumping his marblesque upper lip, but the face on this white bust bears eye makeup and a hint of blush, and feathers sprout from the neck on either side. (“Lenin as Brian Eno in his early Roxy Music days,” King explains.) Often, King’s art seems virtually indistinguishable from his design work, as in his maps whose cheerfully colored Marimekko-ish dots represent domestic murders. This monograph is dedicated to the many hats of Scott King, whose work has been exhibited widely in London, New York and European galleries including KW Berlin, Portikus, White Columns, Kunstverein Munich and The Museum of Modern Art, New York.

Graffiti artist Steve Powers started painting his “ESPO” alias across the walls and rooftops of Philadelphia in ${\displaystyle1984},$ just as the city’s Anti-Graffiti Network was launched. Twenty-five years later, in the summer of 2009, he returned to Philly, armed with 1,200 cans of spray paint, 800 gallons of bucket paint and 20 of the finest spray-painters in America, to inscribe an epic love letter on the rooftops facing the Market-Frankfurt line, as a public art project. Powers consulted the community in West Philly and collaborated with The Mural Arts Program and the Pew Center, and with their help transformed this 20-block stretch of buildings into visual and architectural Valentine poems, with lines such as: “This love is real so dinner is on me” and “Knocked on your door/ legs tired back sore/ migraine for sure/ no more I swore you smile I’m cured.” A Love Letter for You: Brick Valentines on the Philly Skyline documents in full color the art and the neighborhood that inspired Powers’ work, and is designed as an open Valentine love letter for all to use. Steve Powers was born and raised in Philadelphia, and then moved to New York City in 1994. After stints as publisher of $O n$ the Go magazine, author of the book The Art Of Getting Over and full-time graffiti writer, Powers opened a studio in January 1998.

# How Many Billboards? Edited by Peter Noever. Text by Kimberli Meyer, Gloria Sutton, Lisa Henry, Nizan Shaked.  

In an urban zone crisscrossed by multilane freeways and gridded with broad boulevards, the roadside billboards of Los Angeles may well be the city’s most visible platform for art. How Many Billboards? documents a 2010 project in which billboards in Los Angeles were turned over to 23 artists to do with as they wished, asserting the ongoing legacy of California Conceptualism and its combination of language-based strategies with Pop-inflected aesthetics. “Astonish!” declares Kenneth Anger’s billboard, in commanding upper-case orange lettering, recapitulating Diaghilev’s famous advice to Cocteau.“I Look Good, I Know,” says Yvonne Rainer’s billboard;“I Can’t Hear, I Can’t See, But I Look Good.” Martha Rosler’s collaboration with Josh Neufeld makes a plea for spending on higher education in California, and Renée Green’s image of a darkened shore with silhouetted figures gathered near a tourist ferry is accompanied by the two-line commentary “Strangers begin again/Native strangers hosting.” Other artists participating in this occasion are Michael Asher, Jennifer Bornstein, Eileen Cowin, Christina Fernandez, Ken Gonzales Day, Kira Lynn Harris, Larry Johnson, John Knight, David Lamelas, Brandon Lattu, Daniel Joseph Martinez, Kori Newkirk, Allen Ruppersberg, Allan Sekula, Susan Silton, Kerry Tribe, Jim Welling and Lauren Woods. Essays by Kimberli Meyer, Gloria Sutton and Nizan Shaked, who co-curated the project, contextualize the works in relation to Conceptual and $\mathsf{P o p}$ art idioms, provide background material on the artists and outline the MAK Center’s plans to enliven public space.

# Jon Burgerman: Pens Are My Friends  

Text by Harlan Levey, Peter Thaler, Lars Denicke. For the first time, British artist and illustrator Jon Burgerman’s commercial, personal and collaborative works are collected together in this lavish and fun publication. Burgerman’s brightly colored parades of monster faces and abstract glyphs have found their way onto a huge range of merchandise—toys, clothing (for Ripcurl), snowboards, exhibitions, murals, customizations, sketchbooks, even a sick bag—as well as galleries around the world (he is especially popular in China and Japan, whose graphic arts traditions his work draws on). Burgerman’s personal pantheon of like minds includes Phil Frost, Mr. Jago of the Scrawl Collective, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Barry McGee—all of whom make sense as inspirations, and none of whom quite resemble his maniacal, over-the-top style. Accompanying the hundreds of pages of brainmelting doodles, drawings, characters and colors are essays by the Pictoplasma team and editors of Modart magazine, insights into Burgerman’s working process and, of course, photos of salads. The included DVD is packed with animated goodies, documentary stuff and things to beautify your computer. Enter the world of Jon Burgerman’s art, where no surface is safe from his meandering lines!

# DGPH: The Ark Project An Illustrated Animal Bible By Artists From All Over The World  

After the example of Noah, who saved the animal species in his ark for posterity, this volume, an “Illustrated Animal Bible by Artists from all over the World,” aspires to rescue and house the animals among us today. Recruiting over 200 artists, illustrators and designers from every corner of the globe, each of whom was invited to select a creature (animal or species) to represent their birthplace, and add it to the Ark, the project has resulted in an amazing illustration bible that mixes styles and techniques, showing how astonishing nature is and why we should take better care of the planet and the species on it. At once fun, graphically charming and ecologically intelligent, Ark wil immediately appeal to children and design audiences. The final parade of animals is astonishing: the burrowing owl for Canada, the capybara for Uruguay, the Carey turtle for Colombia, the Caribean manatee for Puerto Rico, the nene goose for Maui, the spectacled bear for Peru... Ark also supplies a section of “Nature Facts,” an illustrated tale of Noah and a list of all the artists involved—among them Allan Deas, Gustav Dejert, Drew Funk, Chris Garbutt, Kronk, Cecy Meade, Meomi, Noper, Shen Plum and Roland Tamayo.

# Richard Rogers $\mathbf{+}$ Architects: From the House to the City Introduction by Deyan Sudjic. Foreword by Sir Nicholas Serota.

SANAA: New Museum Museum Building Guides Text by Lisa Phillips. Interview with Kazuyo Sejima, Ryue Nishizawa. Photographs by Iwan Baan.  

British architect Richard Rogers has been described as the last humanist, a recognition of his ambition to create public spaces that allow for the diversity and complexity of the contemporary world. This weighty monograph takes a look at the work of Rogers and his partners, from his early career in the 1960s and 1970s, to his famous collaboration with Renzo Piano on the design of the Pompidou Centre (1971–77), to numerous projects up to the present day, through his architectural practice, Richard Rogers Partnership (now Rogers Stirk Harbour $^+$ Partners). Rogers and his team often deploy new materials and innovative techniques to build structures that are lightweight, environmentally friendly and transparent; a signature strategy has been to expose those parts of a structure that have traditionally been concealed, such as water, heating and ventilation ducts, situating them instead on the outside of the building, leaving the internal spaces uncluttered and open. In this book, projects executed by Richard Rogers and his partners are presented in sections devoted to each of the architectural keywords that define his work: legible; transparent; lightweight; systems; green; urban; public; together with sections on both early work and work in progress.  

When the New Museum, long a champion of downtown New York culture and unconventional art, announced that it would build itself a new home on the Bowery—a mostly bleak strip of flophouses and restaurant-supply storefronts— the art world wondered what this move would mean for the museum, and, just as important, how the museum would look. Tokyo-based architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa of SANAA (winners of the 2010 Pritzker Prize) received the commission in 2002; their new New Museum, which opened in December 2007, looks like a dramatic tower of seven rectangular boxes, stacked irregularly atop one another with edges protruding to the sides and front, and clad in a seamless anodized-aluminum mesh that dresses the whole of the building in a delicate, filmy, softly shimmering skin. With windows just visible behind this porous scrimlike surface, the building appears as a single, coherent and even heroic form that is nevertheless mutable, dynamic and animated by the changing light of day—an appropriate visual metaphor for the openness of the New Museum and the ever-changing nature of contemporary art. This monograph treats the institution’s design and construction in depth, through images, writings and an interview with the architects.

# Josep Lluís Sert: Joan Miró Foundation Museum Buliding Guides  

Introduction by Bruno Zevi. Interview with Jaume Freixa. Photographs by Joan Morejón.  

The Joan Miró Foundation opened in 1975, becoming Barcelona’s first public institution to focus entirely on contemporary art. The architect Josep Lluís Sert designed the Foundation’s building with clean, airy white shapes of curves and corners and multiple skylights, creating a decidedly Mediterranean-flavored complex arranged around a central patio, with expansive roof terraces above. (Two subsequent expansions to the building were designed by Jaume Freixa, a pupil and longtime colleague of Sert’s.) After the first major retrospective of Miró’s work occurred in Barcelona in 1968, the artist decided to set up a building to make his work and the work of other contemporary artists permanently accessible to the public. To design the foundation’s home, he tapped his old friend Sert, a pioneer in the introduction of modern architecture in Catalonia, who had first met Miró in 1932 and worked with him on the Spanish (Republican) Pavilion at the Paris World Fair in 1937. This volume, one of a series of monographs on new museum architecture, provides a careful look at the design of one of Europe’s premier art institutions, and includes an interview with the architects responsible for the recent expansions.

# Bernard Tschumi: New Acropolis Museum Museum Building Guides Introduction by Dimitrios Pandermalis. Photographs by Peter Mauss.  

The New Acropolis Museum in Athens is a boldly designed landmark of contemporary architecture, that boasts brilliant natural light, glass floors that afford views onto the archaeological excavation sites below and a top level that is rotated several degrees in relation to the building’s lower floors in order to orient the famous ancient Parthenon Frieze, displayed on the top story, in exactly the same direction that it was in ancient times. Opened to the public in 2009, this museum is the work of Bernard Tschumi, who won a design competition in 2001 with an entry that outlined, the architect said, “a simple and precise museum with the mathematical and conceptual clarity of ancient Greece.” Located in Athens’ historic area of Makryianni, the museum stands less than 1,000 feet southeast of the Parthenon, at the entrance of a network of pedestrian walkways that provide access to the Acropolis. Professor Dimitrios Pandermalis, President of the Organization for the Construction of the New Acropolis Museum, has hailed the design for its “simple, clear, and beautiful solution that is in accord with the beauty and classical simplicity of the Museum’s unique exhibits”; Pandermalis contributes the preface to this volume, one in Poligrafa’s new series of monographs on new museum architecture.

Richard Rogers (born 1933) attended the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, and obtained his MA from the Yale School of Architecture in 1962. From early on in his career, Rogers pursued and thrived on collaboration, working with colleagues such as Norman Foster and Renzo Piano. It was with the latter that Rogers designed the building for which he is perhaps best known today, the Pompidou Center in Paris.

# Robert van ‘t Hoff: Architect of a New Society  

Text by Dolf Broekhuizen, Herman van Bergeijk, Evert van Straaten.  

A principal member of the De Stijl group, the Dutch architect and theorist Robert van ‘t Hoff (1887–1979) designed buildings, composed essays and provided financial support for the movement, making him an animating presence in the Dutch avant garde. Van ‘t Hoff’s view of the architect’s role exemplified the movement’s utopian ideals, and his hands-on approach meant that during the construction of his renowned Villa Henny, for example, the architect was often to be seen on the scaffolding alongside the manual workers (an unusual sight at the time). Villa Henny was one of the earliest houses to be built out of reinforced concrete, and one of the first buildings in Europe to utilize the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright; today it is an icon of modernist architecture and a forerunner of the Nieuwe Bouwen movement. This first monograph on van ‘t Hoff gathers his critical writings alongside unpublished materials and descriptions of his best known projects.

Designed by architects Jan Duiker and Bernard Bijvoet in 1925, the former Zonnestraal Sanatorium is an icon of the Nieuwe Bouwen style, the Dutch branch of the “International Style” of modernism: as one of the genuine highlights of twentieth-century architecture, it has been considered for the UNESCO World Heritage List. The complex, whose name means “ray of sunshine,” was originally created as a treatment center for tuberculosis patients. By the early 1960s, the buildings, which had been constructed for limited use in concrete, steel and glass, were in ruin. After four decades of research and planning, its restoration is nearing completion under the supervision of the architects Hubert-Jan Henket and Wessel de Jonge. This publication traces the former sanatorium’s past, emphasizing the battle for recognition of the Zonnestraal site’s importance, its complex restoration process and providing a critical dossier on the general management of modern monuments.

Located in the Czech Republic, the city of Zlín is a curious example of civic planning in which domestic living, education and recreation were all geared towards a single goal: the profitability of the Bata shoe company, one of the first footwear manufacturers to operate globally. In spring 2009, a symposium initiated by Zipp/German-Czech Cultural Projects, in cooperation with The Brno House of Arts, the Regional Gallery of Fine Arts in Zlín and the National Gallery in Prague, and attended by internationally renowned scholars and local experts, addressed the example of Zlín as a potential model for the future of urban planning and architecture. This anthology presents articles by architects, sociologists and urban theorists on the phenomenon that is Zlín. Plans, photographs, and film stills highlight the unique aesthetic qualities of this model city that complies with no architectural paradigm of the past century.

# Healthcare Architecture in the Netherlands Text by Noor Mens, Cor Wagenaar.  

Over the years, hospitals, psychiatric institutions and hospice facilities for the elderly have been subject to radical change. To a great extent, these buildings—their amenities and accommodations—have been shaped by developments in medicine and government, shifts in societal and patient perceptions, as well as evolution in architectural ideologies and theories. Healthcare Architecture in the Netherlands describes the historical evolution of industry-specific design in the healthcare arena, providing a detailed chronological overview from the emergence of healthcare architecture as its own genre within architectural practice to the most recent innovative complexes. It also features approximately 50 buildings from the last 150 years, with illustrations and detailed descriptions, plus a series of texts that addresses aspects of national and international architecture of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in relation to the health care sector.

# The Green Dream Building Green, Great and Gorgeous Cities Text by Winy Maas, John Thackara.  

The Green Dream investigates what “green” means in practical terms for design, architecture and urbanism. Led by The Why Factory, the global urbanist thinktank headed by Winy Maas, experts in the field debate what is currently considered green and how the term ought to be defined going forward, challenging architectural conventions and looking into the potential of new green architecture. Recognizing that green buildings alone do not make a green city, The Green Dream also looks at broader green solutions for cities and how they might be implemented. Most importantly of all, the book dares to ask “Is a green city actually feasible?” and attempts to answer this question through the help of case studies. Drawing on $36$ illustrated green projects, and with essays by John Thackara and Winy Maas, this volume outlines future goals for architectural and urban projects, and draws on research by The Why Factory, MVRDV and Delft University of Technology.

# Ecological Living What Architecture for a More Sustainable City? Edited by Dominique Gauzin-Müller. Text by Marie-Hélène Contal, Jean-Pierre Ménard, Rafael Magrou.  

The pioneers of ecological architecture today are necessarily researchers as much as architects. Ecological Living assesses a selection of some recently built ecological habitats, collecting built examples from a variety of French architects, examining precursors such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Alvar Aalto and Pierre Lajus, plus proposals for European architects and architecture students and inquiries into the ecological viability of detached housing and tower blocks. The book is structured in thematic chapters, such as “Why is Action So Urgent,”“An International Panorama of the State of the Art” and “Into Action!”

# The Politics of the Impure Towards a Theory of the Imperfect Edited by Joke Brouwer, Arjun Appadurai, Bruce Sterling, Gunnar Heinsohn, Lynn Margulis, Raj Patel.  

Piet Mondrian once wrote that “Life is basically simple. It may grow more and more complex, but it need not lose this simplicity. Complexity needs to be perfected, simplicity is man’s perfect state.” This statement encapsulates the values that would come to inform twentieth-century modernism. But it was not just the era’s art that exalted purity—the same logic was at work in agriculture, urban planning and population control. This publication explores how the desire for “the pure” ultimately manifested as an economic process, advocating a need for technology to become an agent for the impure and the imperfect.

# The Architecture of Knowledge The Library of the Future Edited by Huib Haye van der Werf.  

In the digital information age, when the boundaries of content producer and content consumer are increasingly blurred, The Architecture of Knowledge questions the fate of the public library. The library has historically been a vital component of civic life, but many aspects of its traditional function have already become contentious. This publication asks: what form should the library’s physical structure assume to survive this new data-saturated society? This fascinating journey into the future of an age-old institution is obligatory reading for architects, librarians and users alike.

# Every Day is a Good Day: The Visual Art of John Cage  

Introduction by Roger Malbert. Text by Jeremy Millar, Lauren A. Wright, Helen Luckett. Interviews by Kathan Brown, Ray Kass, Laura Kuhn, Julie Lazar, Irving Sandler.  

One of the twentieth century’s most influential and iconoclastic protagonists, John Cage (1912–1992) may be described not so much as a composer, artist and author, as a thinker who applied his ideas equivalently to sound, visual art and writing. As with his music, the use of chance operations—in particular via the Chinese Book of Changes, or I Ching—was central to Cage’s approach to visual art, determining technique, the placement of forms and even tonal values. Every Day is a Good Day provides the first broad assessment of Cage’s art, and is fully illustrated with plates of his drawings, watercolors and prints, including series such as Where R=Ryoanji (1983–92). Cage’s working methods and philosophies are brought to light in new interviews with key collaborators: printmaker and writer Kathan Brown, founder of Crown Point Press; Laura Kuhn, Director of the John Cage Trust; artist Ray Kass; and Julie Lazar, curator of Cage’s “composition for a museum,” Rolywholyover: A Circus. Extracts from a 1966 interview between John Cage and critic Irving Sandler are also reproduced. At the heart of the book is a “Companion to John Cage,” a selection of quotes by Cage and notes on key themes and influences, all of which make it essential reading on this important figure of the twentieth-century avant garde.  

Left to itself art would have to be something very simple—it would be sufficient for it to be beautiful. But when it’s useful it should spill out of just being beautiful and move over to other aspects of life so that when we’re not with the art it has nevertheless influenced our actions or our responses. —John Cage

# Robert Wilson: From Within  

Edited by Margery Arent Safir. Text by Pierre Bergé, Anne Bogart, Joseph V. Mellio, Rufus Wainwright, Philip Glass, Marina Abramovi´c, Laurie Anderson, John Rockwell, et al. Perhaps the world’s foremost avant-garde theater artist, Robert Wilson (born 1941) ranges across opera, stage works, lighting design, video and even furniture design in his pursuit of astounding gesamtkunstwerk creations; Susan Sontag wrote of his career that “it has the signature of a major artistic creation. I can’t think of any body of work as large or as influential.” Among Wilson’s numerous eminent collaborators are Tom Waits, William Burroughs and David Byrne. His legendary operatic collaboration with composer Philip Glass, Einstein on the Beach, upended conventions of traditional operatic form, and he has also left his mark on masterworks from The Magic Flute to Pélleas et Melisande. Robert Wilson: From Within celebrates the incredible achievements of this “total artist,” from his earliest works to his upcoming work The Life and Death of Marina Abramovi´c. Worldrenowned artists, composers, actors, writers, theater directors and curators, from Marina Abramovi´c and Laurie Anderson to Philip Glass and Rufus Wainwright, contribute testimonials.

Working in a variety of media and a range of scales, from humble works on paper to monumental staged performances, Francis Alÿs (born 1959) has established himself as one of the world’s leading contemporary artists. Based in Mexico City since 1986, the artist fashions much of his work from the street life he observes during long walks throughout the city. Bringing together a variety of participants, from Mexican sign-painters to British Guardsmen, his collaborations have produced several well-known works, including “When Faith Moves Mountains” (2002), in which he enlisted 500 volunteers to attempt to move a sand dune one foot from its original position using shovels, and “The Modern Procession” (2002), a ceremonial procession commemorating MoMA’s temporary move to Queens, New York, that included a brass band and uniformed participants carrying reproductions of the Museum’s most famous works across the Queensboro bridge. Published to accompany the largest retrospective of Alÿs’ work to date, this publication is more a guidebook than a conventional monograph, reflecting the spirit of the artist’s wandering practice. It features an introductory essay by Mark Godfrey, a curator at the Tate Modern, an index of quotes from ${\mathsf{A l j}}{\ddot{\mathsf{y}}}{\mathsf{s}}^{\prime}$ previous writings and interviews compiled by Klaus Biesenbach, Director of P.S.1 Contemporary Arts Center, and descriptions of works written by Alÿs and Cuauhtémoc Medina, freelance curator and art critic, as well as responses to the artist’s work from a wide range of critics and commentators.

# Olafur Eliasson: Inner City Out +br  

One of the most important artists of his generation, Olafur Eliasson (born $\boldsymbol{\cdot}\boldsymbol{9}67)$ creates immersive environments and spectacular public installations that probe the cognitive aspects of vision and transform the act of looking into a social experience. Merging art and science, Eliasson engages the observer as participant, challenging the passive viewing experience by utilizing such elements as temperature, smell, moisture and light to trigger physical sensations. Olafur Eliasson: Inner City Out documents the artist’s first project in Berlin, where he has lived and worked for many years. Designed for the Martin-Gropius-Bau, and curated by Daniel Birnbaum, it examines the relationship between the museum and the city, bridging the two through ephemeral installations placed in various locations throughout the city as well as within the museum itself.

The monumental interventions of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, now beloved by millions across the world, began in late-1950s Paris, amid the assemblage art of the Nouveaux Réalistes. Composed in close cooperation with Christo and Jeanne-Claude, just prior to JeanneClaude’s death in November 2009, Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Early Works 1958–64, is the first publication in almost 40 years to deal in depth with the early work of the duo. Previously unpublished works and photographs from the artists’ archives narrate the road from Christo’s arrival in Paris in 1958 to his and Jeanne Claude’s relocation to New York in 1964. Along with an introductory text by Matthias Koddenberg, the book contains an extensive interview with the artists and a detailed chronology.

This book compiles documentation for two unrealized projects by the legendary duo of Christo (born 1935) and Jeanne-Claude (1935–2009): “The Mastaba,” a project conceived in 1977 for the United Arabic Emirates, and “Over the River,” a project recently conceived for the Arkansas River. “Mastaba,” Arabic for “bench,” is proposed as a sculpture of approximately 410,000 horizontally stacked and variously colored oil barrels. Trees and shrubbery would be planted around the Mastaba as a windbreak against the sand and windstorms; the area adjacent to the walkways approaching the Mastaba would resemble an oasis with flowers and grass. “Over the River” consists of a succession of fabric panels to be suspended above the Arkansas River, for a period of two weeks sometime between mid-July and mid-August of any given year in the future (2013 at the earliest). Both projects are fully illustrated with preparatory drawings and photographs of the proposed locations.

# In the Shadow a Shadow: The Work of Joan Jonas  

# Essay by Joan Simon. Text by Johanna Burton, Barbara Clausen, Douglas Crimp.  

One of the most continuously influential figures of the past half century, Joan Jonas (born 1936) was among the first artists to embrace the forms of video, performance and installation. From her beginnings as a sculptor, and her emergence in the New York art and performance scenes of the 1960s and 70s (including the seminal “Vertical Roll” video piece of 1972, in which the titular television malfunction enacted a memorably fractured female identity), up through her performance at the Performa 09 biennial and recent collaborations with composer Alvin Lucier and the avant-garde theater company The Wooster Group, her work has always been surprising, groundbreaking and necessary. This extensively illustrated volume, containing hundreds of full-color images, presents the definitive collection of Jonas’ work. The first career-spanning monograph of the multimedia pioneer, it covers more than 40 years of performances, films, videos, installations, texts and video sculptures. In addition to documentation of the artist’s crucial projects, In the Shadow a Shadow includes individual essays by Douglas Crimp, Barbara Clausen and Johanna Burton, a major survey text by Joan Simon, and unpublished photographs and drawings from Jonas’ archives. This intensively researched and authoritative book documents the range, breadth and depth of one of most prolifically original artists of the twentieth and twenty-first century.

# Bruce Nauman: Live or Die Collector’s Choice Vol. 10 Text by Eugen Blume.  

”Some forty-odd years after Bruce Nauman began tweaking the conventions of studio practice and the hallowed persona of the ‘artistas-seer,’” Pamela M. Lee wrote in Artforum not long ago, “his station in postwar art history rests secure. His influence—whether through his affectless, task-based performances, his sculptural castings of negative space, or his intermedia mash-ups of language, video and noise—is everywhere apparent in contemporary art.” Indeed, from the American artist’s early work in sculpture and video, made in the 1960s, through his famous spiral of neon letters spelling out “the true artist helps the world by revealing mystic truths,” which at once summarized and opened to critique the perennial mystique of the artist, up through his three-venue Golden Lion Award–winning exhibition at the 2009 Venice Biennale, Nauman’s work has long been an indispensable part of the narrative of recent American art. This essential volume, published in DuMont’s fantastic Collector’s Choice series, treats these and other recurrent themes of his oeuvre, such as sound, language, corporeality and dance, reproducing works from across his career and and providing a new standard overview of this ever-popular artist.

# John Baldessari: Parse Edited by Beatrix Ruf.  

John Baldessari (born 1931) is a luminary in the realms of Conceptual art and book art, and one of the most important figures in contemporary art of the last 40 years. Since his sensational Cremation Project of 1970, for which he incinerated every single painting he had made between 1953 and 1966, Baldessari’s work has mined the tensions between language, image and sign-making. Baldessari unpicks the very mechanisms of media representation, and even the idea of artistic subject matter itself, using painting, photography, film/video, collage and reliefs, integrating images and text from advertising and movies into his works. Since 1980, Baldessari has worked mostly without text in serial photographs and pictures, and strategies such as overpainting, visual omissions and withheld information have increasingly taken on the earlier function of language. For this superbly designed book, Baldessari has designed a sequence of enigmatically fragmentary and geometrically emphatic images, arranged rhythmically across the volume’s landscape format, that slowly accrete narrative as the reader-viewer moves through the book. These fragments, derived largely from B-movie stills, lead into a second chapter that reproduces the “complete” pictures. Juggling these themes of composition, information, omission and rhythm, Parse consolidates Baldessari’s signature concerns into a great work of book art.

# Andy Warhol Enterprises  

# Text by Thomas Crow, Vincent Fremont, Sarah Green, Allison Unruh.  

”Business art is the step that comes after Art,” Andy Warhol once observed, of his career trajectory; “I started as a commercial artist, and I want to finish as a business artist.” In all of his work as an artist, filmmaker, director of the Factory, band manager, magazine publisher and television entrepreneur, Warhol willfully disrupted and dismantled the line between art and commerce, terminally collapsing the values of art at the midcentury by brazenly asserting that “Good business is the best art.” Warhol began his career as a commercial designer, achieving commendations from the Art Director’s Club and the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and first published his art in popular magazines such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and the New Yorker; his naming of the his workplace as a “Factory” was an overt declaration of the new American art as a continuation of (Henry) Fordist assembly-line production. Andy Warhol Enterprises examines Warhol’s complex and multifarious relationship to commerce in both his work and life, from his highly successful career as a commercial artist to his reign as a cultural tastemaker in the 1980s. The catalogue features a new essay by renowned scholar Thomas Crow and an interview with Vincent Fremont, one of Warhol’s close associates, which further illuminate aspects of Warhol’s critical engagement with the commercial market.

# Andy Warhol: Still Lifes and Feet 1956–1961  

Throughout his career, Andy Warhol drew prolifically, and in his studies of the human form, he returned time and time again to portraits of shoes and feet. Executed with ballpoint pen in sketchbooks, these elegant drawings alternately depict bare feet, or feet in shoes, socks and slippers, and feet posed with various props. Accompanying a January 2010 show at Paul Kasmin Gallery, Still Lifes and Feet 1956–1961 presents $^{58}$ of Warhol’s foot and shoe drawings, reproduced here for the first time.

# Andy Warhol: Ladies and Gentlemen  

# Text by Pier Paolo Pasolini.  

In 1975, Andy Warhol undertook a series of portraits of New York City transvestites. The method for making these portraits followed Warhol’s customary formula: a Polaroid portrait of the sitter was silkscreened onto a canvas, which was then embellished with synthetic polymer paint in a bright array of red, pinks, yellows and pastels. This beautifully produced monograph features 40 spot-varnished color reproductions of the Ladies and Gentlemen series, and reprints Pier Paolo Pasolini’s fascinating take on the series.

# Warhol After Munch  

Text by Siegfried Gohr, Gunnar Danbolt, Henriette Dedichen, Poul Erik Tøjner. In 1984, Andy Warhol took on a potentially surprising new subject: the work of Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944). Warhol made a series of prints based on four of Munch’s major works—the iconic “The Scream,” “Madonna,”“Self-Portrait” and “The Brooch.” Published for an exhibition at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, and featuring a beautifu silkscreened cover, Warhol After Munch unites Warhol’s series with its source material, reproducing previously unpublished works.

Andy Warhol: The   
Early Sixties   
Paintings and Drawings   
1961–1964   
Edited by Bernhard Mendes   
Bürgi, Nina Zimmer. Text by   
Sebastian Egenhofer, Georg Frei. After a successful career in advertising design, Andy Warhol (1928–1987) change course to pursue a career in art. His concerns, however, did not change, remaining centered on the world of consumerism and mass production. This publication illuminates Warhol’s early years as a   
painter and producer of drawings, from 1961 to 1964. During this period, Warhol gradually replaced his somewhat individualized visual language with purely media-derived (and   
therefore collective) subject matter, and developed the mechanical   
painting process of silkscreening on canvas for which he became so well known. This fascinating process— in essence the gestation of Pop art— is examined here through several series, such as the Campbell’s soup can paintings and the Dollar Bills, the star series of Elvis and Liz, the Death and Disaster pictures and   
the Flowers series from 1964. By   
concentrating on Warhol’s early   
years, this publication makes it   
possible to comprehend the scope of his impact.

# Roy Lichtenstein: The Black-and-WhiteDrawings 1961–1968  

Text by Isabelle Dervaux, Graham Bader, Clare Bell, Lindsey Tyne. Between 1961 and 1968, at the height of the Pop art movement, Roy Lichtenstein (1923–1997) created about 50 large black-and-white drawings. Not only was their imagery, culled from consumer culture, entirely new—baked potatoes, ads for foot medication and BB Guns—but so was their treatment, which drew on the rudimentary character of cheaply printed commercial drawings. Conceived independently from Lichtenstein’s paintings, these drawings recast illustrations from newspaper ads and comic books into works of keen visual intensity, curiously echoing the clean-edge aesthetic of 1960s geometric abstraction. “Drawing is the basis of my art,” Lichtenstein later affirmed; “It is where my thinking takes place.” Published for an exhibition at the Morgan Library in New $\mathsf{Y o r k},$ this richly illustrated publication offers 120 color illustrations, plus essays on Lichtenstein’s technique and on his little-known 1967 Aspen project, in which the artist transformed a room into a black-and-white cartoon drawing.

# Alex Katz: Prints Edited by Klaus Albrecht Schröder. Text by Felix Zdenek, Marietta Mautner Markhof, Werner Spies.  

Alex Katz (born 1927) is best known as a painter—specifically, as a painter of his family and his distinguished circle of friends, including poets, writers and artists. In the early 1950s, he began experimenting with printmaking, but it was not until the mid 1960s that he intensified his interest and production in the medium. Pushing at the limits of various printing techniques, Katz tested out pictorial ideas first conceived for his paintings, retaining planes of matte color but further simplifying his forms and dramatically cropping his images. These reduced compositions were wonderfully compatible with the graphic clarity of printmaking, and by effectively translating his paintings into prints, the artist achieved what he called the “final synthesis of painting.” This publication provides insight into an often-neglected yet vital aspect of Katz’s work, from the early 1950s to the present day.

# Robert Rauschenberg & Jean Tinguely: Collaborations  

Over the course of his entire career, Robert Rauschenberg dedicated works to only five other artists: John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, and the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely. The practices of Tinguely and Rauschenberg, both of whom were born in 1925, intersected kinetically during a few pivotal years in the early 1960s. In a 1960 exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, just weeks after Tinguely arrived in New York for the first time, the Swiss artist presented “Homage to New York,” a self-destructing mass of metal to which Rauschenberg contributed a toaster that flung silver dollars at the audience. The two men joined forces on several more artistic projects, despite their aesthetic differences: Rauschenberg once remarked of Tinguely,“He liked mechanical things such as engines; I preferred hedonistic things such as bathtubs.” Robert Rauschenberg & Jean Tinguely: Collaborations documents this productive friendship.

# Ida Applebroog: Monalisa  

# Text by Julia Bryan-Wilson.  

In 2009, a box of forgotten notebooks was rediscovered in the basement of Ida Applebroog’s studio—Strathmore drawing tablets, with the words “Vagina Drawings” scrawled on the cover. Forty years prior, Applebroog took sanctuary from the pressures of the home in an evening bath. Her nightly soak offered her moments of meditation and, equipped with her drawing pad, she began drawing portraits of her crotch. Applebroog’s newest body of work, Monalisa, is in many ways an extension of that ritual. The centerpiece of this project is a room-sized wooden structure covered with more than 100 new vagina drawings—reappropriations of the 1969 originals. In the catalogue essay, Julia Bryan-Wilson contends that the installation, “with its signature figural obsessions and urgent feminist force, feels like an epic culmination of [Applebroog’s] entire oeuvre.” Monalisa offers new insight into Applebroog’s work with full-color reproductions of the never-before-seen 2009 drawings, images of the installation and an essay by Julia Bryan-Wilson.

# Hannah Wilke: Gestures Text by Tracy Fitzpatrick, Saundra Goldman.  

The act of folding is the salient gesture in the sculptures of American artist Hannah Wilke (1940–1993). Taking such materials as clay, bubble gum and Play-Doh, Wilke fashioned serial forms that folded inward or opened out with overtly labial sensuousness. Wilke often placed these objects in compromising situations—hinged with pins or glued to walls and boards, placed freely on the floor, always seemingly on the verge of disaster. Today she is famed for her many nude self-portraits, which have threatened to eclipse the sculptural basis of both the portraits themselves and her work in general. By emphasizing folding as a “gesture,” this catalogue—the first on the artist to appear in many years—unites Wilke’s sculpture and photography under the rubric of performance, and the performing of material. With an abundance of color reproductions and critical commentary, Hannah Wilke: Gestures offers a fresh assessment of a pioneer in sculpture, feminist art and performance.

# Rosemarie Trockel: Drawings  

Edited by Anita Haldemann, Christoph Schreier. Text by Gregory Williams, Brigid Doherty. The German artist Rosemarie Trockel (born 1952) adapts a variety of media to address contentious matters of gender. Trockel is perhaps best known for her knit “canvases” of the mid-1980s, in which lengths of knitted wool patterned with political and consumer motifs such as the hammer and sickle or the Playboy bunny were hung on stretchers to resemble conventional paintings. In a gently humorous work from 1988, Trockel fitted a steel cube with six hot plates, in a simultaneous nod to the pervasive masculinity of Minimalism and the feminine domain of cooking. Regardless of media, Trockel begins each new work with ink, charcoal, pencil, collaged, or computer drawings. These serve as studies, charting her observations and methods, and also constitute an independent body of work. This publication presents a selection of graphic prints and a series of drawings and collages made especially for this book, along with designs for the book itself.

# Lee Lozano  

# Text by Iris Müller-Westermann, Jo Applin, Lucy R. Lippard, Benjamin Meyer-Krahmer.  

The career of American artist Lee Lozano (1930–1999) was brief but extraordinarily intense. Throughout the 1960s, during the transition from Pop art to Minimalism and Conceptualism, and up until her self-imposed exile in the 1970s, Lozano created a genuinely radical and frequently obscene body of work that traversed a gamut of idioms. Her early paintings were executed in a messy cartoon style, oozing with violence and sexuality. By 1967, Lozano was responding to Minimalism and Op art with her abstract Wave paintings. It was also around this time that she initiated a series of actions that tested both the limits of art and acceptable conduct in society, such as smoking pot, masturbating and, mostly notoriously of all, boycotting women. This publication accompanies a retrospective of Lozano’s works at Moderna Museet in Stockholm—works which after 40 years remain as witty, acerbic and shockingly fresh as ever.

# Philip Guston: Roma  

Text by Dore Ashton, Peter Benson Miller.  

Since Philip Guston’s death in 1980, his late figurative paintings and drawings have steadily reaped the acclaim they deserve—acclaim that was largely denied them during Guston’s lifetime (Hilton Kramer infamously reviewed Guston as “a mandarin pretending to be a stumblebum” in a damning 1970 New York Times article). This volume reunites a selection of paintings from the Roma series, completed during Guston’s residency at the American Academy in Rome in 1970–71. From early in his career, Guston had taken inspiration from Italian art, and his 1973 painting “Pantheon” features a list of Italian painters: de Chirico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Giotto and Tiepolo. Italian cinema (especially Fellini) and classical sculpture were also dear to his heart. The Roma works consolidate this dialogue with Italian art and culture. Diary entries published alongside the reproductions recount exchanges at the American Academy, pilgrimages to Venice, Arezzo, Sicily and Orvieto, and observations of the international cultural community in Rome.

# Robert Ryman: Variations and Improvisations Text by Vesela Sretenovic.  

For over 50 years, Robert Ryman (born 1930) has explored the materiality of paint and the surfaces to which he applies it, in white-on-white paintings that subtly attain the status of painted objects rather than patterned gestures or depictions of further objects. Published on the occasion of the Phillips Collection’s Ryman exhibition in Washington, D.C., Robert Ryman: Variations and Improvisations presents approximately 25 small-scale works, all of which are drawn from private collections, and some of which have only rarely been shown in the U.S. An interview with the artist is included.

# Pousette-Dart: Predominantly White Paintings  

Foreword by Dorothy Kosinski. Text by David Anfam, Carter Ratcliff.  

During the early 1950s, Richard Pousette-Dart (1916–1992) created one of the most anomalous bodies of work of his career: graphite drawings on undercoats of blue or ocher painted over a titanium white ground. For an artist known for his love of color and impasto, these “predominantly white paintings” constituted quite a departure. Twentyfive works were shown at Betty Parsons Gallery in 1955, in an exhibition titled Predominantly White; the artist returned to mine this vein in later paintings in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

# Manuel Felguerez Text by Dore Ashton, Juan Villoro, Jorge Reynoso, Alberto González, Angélica García.  

A painter of rare independent vision, with an oeuvre that stretches back a half-century, Manuel Felguérez (born 1928) is among Mexico’s greatest living artists. His abstract paintings of the 1950s and 1960s offered expressively worked surfaces and a scratchy mark-making; later he arrived at the work for which he is best known, abstractions of a more classical bent that evoke the cylindrical geometries of Fernand Léger and Francis Picabia. But from the start, Felguérez’s painting has been characterized by its earthy feel and warm hues. This superbly produced monograph presents his work to an international audience.

# Romare Bearden in the Modernist Tradition  

Introduction by Pamela Ford. Text by Robert G. O’Meally, Kobena Mercer, et al.  

Known for his rich, complex collage works that depict large-scale themes via African-American subjects, Romare Bearden (1911–1988) drew inspiration from myriad cultural influences—from historical and modern art to music and literature. According to The New York Times’ Michael Kimmelman, “His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere; that it was about mixing and adding, a positivist enterprise.” Based on the 2007 National Bearden Symposium, this volume examines Bearden’s relationships to modernism, postmodernism and the avant garde, through his wideranging interests and associations with artists, intellectuals and musicians of his era—including Duke Ellington, Ralph Ellison and Stuart Davis, to name a few—as well as his practices.

# Retro/Active: The Work of Rafael Ferrer Edited by Deborah Cullen. Text by Edward J. Sullivan, Vincent Katz, Carter Ratcliff.  

Retro/Active: The Work of Rafael Ferrer is the first major publication to examine the breadth and depth of Puerto Rican-born Rafael Ferrer’s influential production over the past 55 years. From Ferrer’s avant-garde art actions in the 1960s through his more recent brightly colored paintings paying homage to island life, his artistic journey has always reflected his intelligence, humor and a uniquely Caribbean perspective. Here, essays by curator Deborah Cullen and scholar Edward Sullivan chronicle Ferrer’s biography and artistic output, consider the Caribbean and western influences in his work, and chart his early sources, including the Surrealists, Dada, Wifredo Lam and Puerto Rican master Francisco Oller y Cestero. This volume also includes Carter Ratcliff’s reprisal of his outof-print 1973 opus “Rafael Ferrer in the Tropical Sublime” and Vincent Katz’s interview with the artist. In all, Retro/Active features over 100 full-color plates and archival images, and will spark a critical reconsideration of Ferrer’s work.

# Nalini Malani: Splitting the Other Edited by Bernhard Fibicher. Text by Doris von Drathen, Andreas Huyssen, Whitney Chadwick.  

One of the most important contemporary artists working in India today, Nalini Malani (born 1946) employs painting, video installation, shadow play and theater-oriented works to envisage the rapidly changing political and economic situation of South Asia and the place of women within society. Mobilizing a cross-cultural and cross-epochal cast of female archetypes—from Hindu figures such Radha and Sita to such Western icons as Medea, Cassandra and Lewis Carroll’s Alice—and addressing topics including war, fanaticism, economic development and environmental destruction, she melds the global with the local, the universal with the specific, narrativity with metanarrativity. Splitting the Other offers extensive documentation of Malani’s memorable work in multiple media, in DVD as well as stills, as well as texts by feminist art historian Whitney Chadwick (Women, Art and Society), German art historian Doris von Drathen (Vortex of Silence) and scholar Andreas Huyssen (Other Cities, Other Worlds).

The Belgian-born artist Francis Alÿs (born 1959) is known for his walks and tales executed in a wide range of media (documentary film, painting, photography, performance, video and installation) that marry humor and sensitivity, banality and spontaneity, personal and political. A compulsive wanderer, many of his works involve intense observation and recording of the social, cultural and economic conditions of urban life. This beautifully designed volume presents an ongoing series of paintings that function as kind of a storyboard and archive of the artist’s oeuvre to date. Begun in 1996, Le Temps du Sommeil (“The Time of Sleep”) comprises over 100 paintings accompanied by instructions and postcards related— sometimes obliquely—to the artist’s past performative actions. The instructions and paintings are presented en face, giving birth to a text-image dialogue that is sometimes witty and always fascinating. Le Temps du Sommeil affirms Alÿs yet again as an artist always able to surprise.

# Donald Baechler: XL + XS  

With the collage sensibility of Robert Rauschenberg and the colorful brashness of Cy Twombly, American painter Donald Baechler (born 1956) makes works of invigorating vitality, positing boldly symbolic shapes (flowers, skulls, globes), rendered in cartoonthick black outlines, onto collaged or painted backgrounds, or else confronting marbled, tea-stained grounds with heavy black silhouettes, potato-print style, of plants, rough human forms and other evocative formations. Baechler’s newest volume here presents 200 color reproductions of his recent works: seven gargantuan canvases (“XL”) and hundreds of modestlyscaled drawings (“XS”), no larger than a legal pad of paper. These could be described as postmodern cave drawings: “I tend to be interested,” the artist has said, “in things I find on the street or things drawn on toilet walls or things drawn by someone I meet in a bar, who maybe has never made a drawing since he was five years old.”

# Gary Hume: Yardwork  

# Text by Dave Hickey.  

Gary Hume (born 1962) first found acclaim in London in the late 1980s, when his bold paintings of hospital doors, rendered at life-size scale in high-gloss hardware store paints on aluminum panels, drew much attention and ushered Hume into the ranks of the Young British Artists. Twenty years later, Yardwork features recent paintings and sculpture completed by Gary Hume in his upstate New York studio. The pictures explore familiar themes in Hume’s work, including flowers, birds, doors and female figures. In the new work, however, the doors are now barn doors, as opposed to the hospital doors found in his earlier works; the blackbirds, roses and daisies are all things he sees from his window, not images drawn from books or media. Yardwork includes an essay by Dave Hickey that places Hume’s paintings in the context of a group of artists the author names “abstractionists of daily life.”

# Iona Rozeal Brown Text by Isolde Brielmaier, Megan Lykins Reich.  

Infusing Japanese Ukiyo-e compositions with hip-hop styling, American painter Iona Rozeal Brown (born 1966) investigates in her electrifying narrative canvases the globalization and appropriation of ethnic cultures. Brown’s hybridities, which she terms “Afro Asiatic allegories,” draw on the many parallels between Ukiyo-e and hip-hop—their narrative content, graphic sophistication and broad popular appeal—ultimately revealing the fluidity of history, identity and fashion. For the exhibition which this monograph accompanies, MOCA Cleveland has commissioned a new series of paintings from Brown. In the resulting work, which is based in part on Japanese prints from the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, Brown creates an epic visual tale in which the artist’s heroine embodies the qualities that she hopes to inspire in young women and men—confidence, courage and sincerity.

# Wangechi Mutu: This You Call Civilization?  

The alluring and intricate collages of Kenyan-born, New York-based artist Wangechi Mutu (born 1972) draw the viewer into narratives of beauty, consumerism, colonialism, race, identity and gender politics. Oriented around imagery of the human body, Mutu’s work aims at a visual deconstruction of traditional figuration, reconciling the experience of her Kenyan upbringing with present-day American realities. Published to accompany Mutu’s first major survey at the Art Gallery of Ontario, This You Call Civilization? demonstrates the breadth of the artist’s oeuvre to date, encompassing numerous works on paper produced since 2001, plus two large-scale installations and two video works. It also includes excerpts from favorite key source books selected by Mutu from her personal library, each of them formative in her quest to raise public awareness about racial and political issues through her art.

# Gerhard Richter: Volker Bradke  

# Edited by Dietmar Elget. Text by Hubertus Butin.  

Few have done more to revolutionize contemporary painting than Gerhard Richter (born 1932). Amazingly—given the German artist’s fame and influence—his only film remains largely unknown to this day. Made in 1966, Volker Bradke focuses on a young denizen of the Düsseldorf art scene. It was first exhibited that same year along with a painted portrait and photographs (since lost), at the legendary Schmela Gallery in Düsseldorf. A virtually unknown figure outside of his small circle, Bradke was briefly catapulted by this film into the realm of art celebrity, before fading once more into relative obscurity. This publication, which includes a DVD and essay by art historian Hubertus Butin, is the first to present this film, analyzing it in its original cultural context, and situating it within the artist’s oeuvre.

# Sigmar Polke: Windows for the Zürich Grossmünster  

Text by Marina Warner, Gottfried Boehm, Katharina Schmidt, Jacqueline Burckhardt. Sigmar Polke (born 1941) recently completed a series of 12 windows for the Grossmünster cathedral in Zürich, setting new standards for the mutual relationship between art and church. One group of seven Romanesque windows shows luminous mosaics of thinly sliced agate, some of it artificially colored, to produce pulsating blocks of back-lit color. Says Marina Warner,“The interior of rocks opens not only on unexpected colors… on once imprisoned now scintillating rays and gleams, but it also tunnels into the past, into the distant past of geological and cosmological millennia.” For the remaining five windows, Polke designed images of figures from the Old Testament, based on medieval illuminations, which have themselves undergone transformation in the course of their long journey through time. Polke’s figures now appear as radiantly contemporary icons created in colored glass, using a variety of traditional and customized techniques devised especially for this project.

# Michelangelo Pistoletto: Mirror Works  

Text by Michael Auping, Pascal Gielen, Jeremy Lewison. Michelangelo Pistoletto (born 1933) is one of Arte Povera’s most significant protagonists. It is with the Mirror Paintings that Pistoletto’s name is mostly closely identified, an ongoing series begun in 1962 that has earned him rapid and enduring international recognition. These works are made from sheets of mirror-finished stainless steel, “fitted” with a full-length portrait photograph that has been meticulously traced and painted onto its surface (after 1971 the image was silkscreened on). The inclusion in the work of the viewer, his or her surroundings and his or her interaction with the photographed person “in the mirror” is the key to the boggling reflexivity that drives this work. This book evaluates the Mirror Paintings of the past four years. It includes an interview with the artist and a fully illustrated chronology of Mirror Paintings from 1962 to the present.

# Alighiero e Boett Mappa Text by Jean-Christophe Ammann.  

A recent spate of exhibitions and an upcoming retrospective have drawn increased attention to the Italian Arte Povera pioneer Alighiero Boetti (or, in his identitysuturing guise, Alighiero e [“and”] Boetti) (1940–1994). Perhaps Boetti’s best-known works are the textile maps of the world that he commissioned from female weavers in Afghanistan and Pakistan, beginning in 1971. In these maps, every country appears in the color and design of its national flag, and the borders are inscribed with texts of Boetti’s devising along with statements from the local populace about their political aspects of their daily life. “I did nothing for this work,” the artist has said, “chose nothing myself, in the sense that the world is shaped as it is, I did not draw it; the flags are what they are, I did not design them. In short I created absolutely nothing.”This monograph on Boetti’s now-classic cartographic pieces features 40 color images and an essay by Jean-Christophe Ammann.

# Richard Hamilton: Modern Moral Matters Serpentine Gallery Text by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Julia Peyton-Jones, Benjamin H.D. Buchloh.  

With his memorably titled 1956 collage “Just What is it that Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing?”, British artist Richard Hamilton (born 1922) heralded the British Pop revolution; and with his 1967 Swingeing London series of prints, which depicted the arrest of Mick Jagger and Robert Fraser, Hamilton’s art entered the general public consciousness. But unlike so many Pop artists, Hamilton was never an uncritical or ambivalent advocate of postwar society, and he has often agitated directly against it, producing a great deal of openly political, satirical work that assaults both consumer culture at large and more immediate political events. This monograph, published for Hamilton’s 2010 exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London (his first exhibition since 1992), brings together Hamilton’s famous “protest” paintings as well as newer political works and features essays by Benjamin H.D. Buchloh and Michael Bracewell.

# Luis Camnitzer  

Edited by Katrin Steffen, Hans-Michael Herzog. Text by Luis Camnitzer, Sabeth Buchmann, Maren Welsch.  

German-born, Uruguay and New York-based artist Luis Camnitzer (born 1937) confronts awkward social and political issues head-on, always inflecting his uneasy subject matter with a keen sense of humor and irony. Over the last 40 years, Camnitzer has developed an international reputation, not only as an artist, but also as a critic, educator and theorist. A leader in the realm of conceptual and political art in Uruguay, he works in a variety of media, including installation, printmaking, drawing and photography, to explore the former Uruguayan dictatorship, and more generally the violence that governments and systems of power inflict on individuals. In his chilling 2008 work “Last Words,” Camnitzer collected the final statements of death row inmates in Texas, assembling a work that compels viewers towards the very brink of mortality. This publication surveys Camnitzer’s influential body of work, from 1966 to the present.

Since the mid-1960s, American conceptualist Elaine Sturtevant (born 1930) has been using her multidisciplinary practice to mercilessly interrogate the commercial and symbolic value of art and the maledriven art world. Working predominantly from memory, she copies iconic works by male artists such as Andy Warhol, Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Beuys and Frank Stella. Often indistinguishable from the originals, Sturtevant’s painting, sculpture, video and photographic facsimiles force thorny issues of replica and simulacra, origin and difference, to a crisis point. Designed in close collaboration with the artist, The Razzle Dazzle of Thinking offers a compilation of Sturtevant’s largely unpublished writings, along with a selection of essays on her life and work. Sturtevant and her rigorous, committed conceptual strategy are central to ongoing debates on the concept of originality in contemporary art and beyond.

# L.A. Object & David Hammons Body Prints Edited by Lindsay Charlwood, Connie Rogers Tilton, Jack Tilton.  

L.A. Object offers a historical overview of the Los Angeles assemblage movement of the 1960s and 70s. It focuses on works by artists often omitted from mainstream gallery and museum historical exhibitions who were working during the civil rights movement, the 1965 Watts riots and the era’s general social and cultural upheaval: Ed Bereal, Wallace Berman, Nathaniel Bustion, Alonzo Davis, Dale Brockman Davis, Charles Dickson, Mel Edwards, David Hammons, George Herms, Daniel La Rue Johnson, Ed Kienholz, Ron Miyashiro, Senga Nengudi, John Outterbridge, Noah Purifoy, Joe Ray, Betye Saar, Kenzi Shiokava and Timothy Washington. Central to this book are the unique body prints of David Hammons—ironic, often political commentaries relevant to the African-American experience that are for the first time presented within the art historical context from which they arose.

# Ernesto Neto  

Edited and introduction by Cliff Lauson. Text by Moacir dos Anjos, Philip Ursprung. Interview by Ralph Rugoff. Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto (born 1964) draws on a variety of sources for inspiration, ranging from the natural world to department stores, modernists like Alexander Calder and Constantin Brancusi to Brazilian predecessors like Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica. Neto’s multi-sensory environments exist, in the artist’s words, as “a place of sensations, a place of exchange and continuity between people.”This important survey is published to accompany an exhibition at London’s Hayward Gallery, in which Neto reimagines the gallery’s concrete spaces and brutalist architecture with a new site-specific commission and a number of new sculptural works. The artist’s works incorporate the Hayward’s outdoor sculpture terraces, creating an interrelated series of spaces in which the relationships between inside and outside are provocatively reconfigured. Spanning Neto’s career to date, this publication contains texts by key international scholars.

# Rachel Harrison: Museum With Walls Text by Tom Eccles, Iwona Blazwick, Jack Bankowsky, David Joselit, Paul Chan, John Kelsey, Allan McCollum, Lucy Raven, Amy Sillman, Steven Stern.  

Rachel Harrison (born 1966) is one of the most exciting artists making sculptures today. Her assemblages of found and constructed objects carry a provisional quality, a wry sense of humor and an all-embracing intelligence. Playing with materials ranging from plinth, pedestal and corrugated cardboard to plastic ketchup bottles, insulated travel mugs and Barbie’s wheelchair-bound friend, Harrison creates colorful, canny, thought-provoking constructions that are worthy peers of Rauschenberg’s Combines. This volume, the most comprehensive monograph of Harrison’s sculpture, video and painting to date, provides documentation of the past 15 years of her work and includes essays by Tom Eccles, David Joselit, Iwona Blazwick and Jack Bankowsky, plus contributions from Paul Chan, John Kelsey, Allan McCollum, Lucy Raven, Amy Sillman and Steven Stern.

# Renée Green: Endless Dreams and TimeBased Streams  

Text by Betti-Sue Hertz, Lia Gangitano, Ros Gray, Lisa Le Feuvre.  

The term “time-based art” is ostensibly a well-known construct by this point, encompassing video, audio and performance work but not textiles or other objects. Yet Renée Green, whose complex installation art has long troubled easy oppositions such as public/ private, center/margin, and history/ fiction, complicates the idea of time-based art as well, recycling the otherwise “static” elements in her vibrant multimedia environments from year to year, thus mobilizing a more expansive notion of the “time-based” to situate her practice in history. Conceived for Green’s 2010 exhibition at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, this volume appraises the intellectual complexity of Green’s ever-evolving art.

# Mark Manders  

Text by Douglas Fogle, Peter Eleey, Heidi Zuckerman Jacobson. Since 1986, Dutch artist Mark Manders (born 1968) has been developing an ongoing project titled Self-Portrait as a Building. Taking the form of sculptures, installations, drawings and projections, these works map Manders’ artistic persona through the conceptual model of a built edifice, in the fashion of the Renaissance memory theater. Inspired by writings on this subject and by other literature, Manders’ earliest works in this project were primarily written, but over time, Manders found ways to deploy everyday threedimensional objects—epoxy figures, animals, teabags, pencils, household furniture—to build a portrait of his own mind as an architectural space. As the artist explains, this imaginary building, being composed of discrete objects, “can shrink or expand at any moment. In this building, all words created by mankind are on hand.” This publication accompanies the first North American touring exhibition of Manders’ work.

# Carlos Garaicoa  

# Text by Okwui Enwezor, Sean Kissane, Enrique Juncosa, Sofía Hernandez.  

Carlos Garaicoa (born 1967) addresses the politics and ideologies of his native Cuba through an examination of its architecture. After the 1959 Cuban revolution, many architectural projects and buildings were left unfinished or abandoned in the nation’s cities. Adopting Havana as his laboratory, Garaicoa creates provocative visual commentaries on such themes as architecture’s ability to alter the course of history, the failure of modernism as a catalyst for social change and the frustration and decay of twentiethcentury utopias. Garaicoa makes his critiques through large installations using materials such as crystal, wax candles and rice-paper lamps: in “Bend City” (2007), the artist constructed a city entirely from cut paper, and “The Crown Jewels” (2009) consists of miniature replicas of real-life torture centers, prisons and intelligence networks, all cast in silver. This publication includes new and recent works, and demonstrates the breadth of Garaicoa’s witty articulations of architecture and urbanism.

# Los Carpinteros Handwork: Constructing the World  

Text by Dagoberto Rodríguez Sánchez, Marco Antonio Castillo Valdés.  

The Havana-based duo of Marco Antonio Castillo Valdés (born 1971) and Dagoberto Rodríguez Sánchez (born 1969) are two of the most exciting artists in Cuba today. Formed in 1991, and working since 1994 under the moniker of Los Carpinteros, which they adopted as a nod to traditional craftsmen’s guilds, the team renounces individual authorship to sabotage the disciplines of design and architecture from within. Their elegant and mordantly humorous sculptures, which attain high standards of craftsmanship assert a deadpan non-functionality: a crazily undulating wooden bookshelf, a filing cabinet with an impossibly deep drawer, or stereo speaker cones transformed into billboard hoardings. By putting functional and serious disciplines to nonfunctional and humorous ends, Los Carpinteros offer a preposterized world in which objects seem to have swapped bodies with other objects. For the first time, that world is presented in depth, in this excellent monograph..

# Hamra Abbas: Object Lessons  

Edited by Anita Dawood, Sharmini Pereira. Text by Anna Sloan, Quddus Mirza, Mia Jankowicz, Sophie Gordon, Haema Sivanesan, Divia Patel, Virginia Whiles, Barbara J. Scheuermann, Hammad Nasar, Sharmini Pereira.  

This publication focuses on the work of Pakistani-born, Bostonbased artist Hamra Abbas (born 1976). Straddling a range of media, including paper collage, painting, sculpture and video, Abbas’ activities adopt a playful approach towards the traditions of her native region. Appropriating the iconography of the Kama Sutra or drawing on Islamic decorative geometries, Abbas creates new platforms from which to conceive notions of culture and exchange. In the work “Read,” for example, a labyrinthine wooden structure is suspended in the air, while concealed speakers play the sound of children learning the Qur’an. Object Lessons captures the range of Abbas’ oeuvre, mirroring its diversity by calling on many critical voices. Eight curators and academics each focus on a specific work, taking a detailed look at a particular aspect of her work. The book also features an in-depth interview with the artist.

# Richard Siegal: If/Then Dialogues Text by Peter Weibel.  

American dancer and choreographer Richard Siegal is famed for his mergings of bodies and systems. In 2005 he created “If/Then,” a piece for two dancers structured as a flowchart organized around gamelike rules: “If I do x, you do y or z,” etc. The following year, Siegal collaborated with Hillary Goidell and Florent Berenger to create “If/Then Open Source,” an online platform— ”predicated on the belief that the beauty of systemic complexity resides in relinquishing individual control to the infinitely more qualified organizational abilities of community development”—whereby visitors can manipulate or add to the basic flowchart of a performance, creating new actions or dragging into new positions existing modules such as “Slap table with both hands simultaneously. Forearms on the table… Justification: An escape” and “Slap the other player as hard as you can. Justification: Violence is never justified.” This DVD uses video and text excerpts to examine Siegal’s work.

# Charles Ray Text by Michael Fried, John Kelsey.  

Ever since the early 1970s, sculptor Charles Ray’s protean practice has yielded some of the most memorable objects and experiences in contemporary art, causing us to confront, as Peter Schjeldahl has written,“elegant, deadpan fabrications that flip wild switches in our minds.” In 1987’s “Ink Line,” for example, he sent a single stream of ink flowing to the middle of a gallery’s floor in a slender column; outside the 1993 Whitney Biennial he parked a massive replica of a toy fire engine. His recent work is just as alluring and unsettling: a steel sculpture of a handheld bird, a poster of an ominous pumpkin, an intricate cast aluminum sculpture of a tractor. Charles Ray surveys the work the artist has made in the past dozen years; an interview by Michael Fried and an essay by John Kelsey complement texts written about each work by Ray himself.

# Andreas Slominski  

Edited by Ingvild Goetz, Karsten Löckemann, Stephan Urbaschek. Text by Katharina Vossenkuhl.  

German artist Andreas Slominski (born 1959) explores the still fertile realm of the readymade, appropriating such functional objects as bicycles, windmills and other found materials which he then reproposes as freestanding sculptures, or which he incorporates, with the use of spray paint, into polystyrene wall reliefs. Slominski always intends his sculptures to elicit the more absurd qualities of the props of everyday life. Though the artist is perhaps best known for his work as an absurdist sculptor, Slominski is also a veteran of absurdist performance: he once famously charged two mimes with the task of carrying an invisible painting from the Royal College of Art to the Serpentine in London. For another similarly wacky work, he had a giraffe in a zoo lick a stamp for a letter he then sent. This monograph surveys the artist’s work from 1996 to the present.

# Franz West: White Elephant  

Text by Patrick Charpenel, Michel Blancsubé, Veit Loers. Since the mid-1960s, Franz West (born 1947) has been finding new ways to balance his art on the line between beauty and ugliness. At the age of $^{14,}$ West—living in bombed-out, post-Nazi Vienna— attended an event organized by the Viennese Actionists, at which Hermann Nitsch smashed a lamb cadaver against the wall of a basement room in a tenement building:“it was incredibly shocking and really depressing,” West said. His own art over the past four decades has eschewed such nihilism: his Adaptives, which he has described as “neuroses made material” (with a nod to Darwin as well), are sculptural objects for viewers to engage physically, using them as ungainly temporary prostheses, appliances, accessories, and instructional tools. White Elephant documents these, as well as West’s important works of furniture and collage, and his marvelously awkward sculptures, which seem lumpily homely and unbalanced, or gangly and hopeful as a blemished teen.

# Micah Lexier: I’m Thinking of a Number Edited and with Introduction by Jan Peacock. Foreword by Garry N. Kennedy. Text by Christina Ritchie, AA Bronson.  

Canadian artist Micah Lexier has built an international reputation working in a variety of media, often making work with numerical themes, such as 1995’s “Self-portrait as a Lucite Cube Divided Proportionally a (Red) Volume Representing Life Lived and a (Clear) Volume Representing Life to Come, Based on Statistical Life Expectancy.” Over the past three decades, he has also produced a significant body of multiple materials to be distributed to viewers, including prize ribbons, printed balloons, custom-minted coins and individually numbered cards. Micah Lexier: I’m Thinking of a Number is a survey of the artist’s invitations, posters, book works, T-shirts, boxed sets and other multiples produced between 1980 and 2010. It includes a multiple created by the artist for this publication—a letterpress sheet of four stickers tipped in as the final work itemized by the monograph.

# Leo Villareal  

American artist Leo Villareal (born 1967) is the most prominent light sculptor among a younger generation of light artists. In 1997, having abandoned his work with interactive television, Villareal began to pursue a more systems-based approach, devising complex light sculptures in which he combined strobe lights, neon, and most recently, LED bulbs activated by the artist’s own extraordinary custom-made software. The effect of these bulbs, and the software that steers their flickering patterns, is cumulative and magical: thousands of tiny white LEDs may resemble a starry night as seen in a planetarium (Villareal installed this work in the windows of the Peter Jay Sharp Building at the Brooklyn Academy of Music), while tubes of colored LEDs masked by a diffuser give a softer effect that resembles something like a Monet painting of water lilies set in motion. This volume accompanies the first museum survey of Villareal’s hypnotic and exhilarating light sculptures at the San Jose Museum of Art.

James Turrell (born 1943) first came to prominence in the late 1960s as a leading artist in the California Light and Space Movement. Informed by his studies in perceptual psychology and optical illusions, Turrell’s works impact the body, mind and spirit. Zug Zuoz is devoted to two contrasting Turrell installations in Switzerland, both of which forge an encounter between the architectural interior and the world beyond it. “Light Transport,” located in the city of Zug, immerses the internal façades and glass roof of the local train station in splendid colors; “Skyspace Piz Uter” in Zuoz is a plain, rounded stone structure with a circular aperture in its roof through which to view the night sky. These two works are usefully representative of the dichotomies explored in Turrell’s practice: artificial versus natural light, urban versus rural settings, color versus blackness. This monograph supplies thorough documentation on the two installations.

# Yves Tanguy & Alexander Calder: Between Surrealism and Abstraction Text by Susan Davidson.  

In 1942, at the opening of her Art of This Century gallery, Peggy Guggenheim famously demonstrated her equability toward both Surrealist and abstract art by wearing one earring made by Surrealist painter Yves Tanguy and one by abstract sculptor and kinetic artist Alexander Calder. Yet the opposition implied by this act of trucemaking perhaps overstates the antimonies between these two modernist masters. Tanguy and Calder shared many friends in Surrealist circles in Paris, and showed work in the same exhibitions throughout the middle of the century. In this beautiful volume, full of color reproductions and important ephemera relating to the artists’ shared history, Susan Davidson, Senior Curator of collections and exhibitions at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, elucidates the overlap between these two canonical modernists.

# On Becoming an Artist: Isamu Noguchi and His Contemporaries, 1922–1960 Foreword by Jenny Dixon. Text by Amy Wolf.  

On Becoming An Artist illuminates the friendships, mentorships and collaborations of Isamu Noguchi (1904–1988), in celebration of the artist’s experimentations and influences. It opens with an account of Noguchi’s early guidance at the hands of sculptors Gutzon Borglum, Constatin Brancusi and Onorio Ruotolo, and features such diverse works as his dance sets for Martha Graham (while highlighting his relationships with other choreographers such as Erick Hawkins and Merce Cunningham), collaborations with Buckminster Fuller, Florence Knoll and George Nelson, and his friendships with artists such as David Hare and Arshile Gorky, and others. The book concludes with Noguchi’s 1950s public projects, including his work with Marcel Breuer and Gordon Bunshaft, and his later unrealized project with Louis Kahn.

# Sophie Taeuber-Arp: Movement and Balance Text by Stephen Kurz, Francois Morellet, Astrid von Asten, Karin Schick.  

The only woman to be represented on a Swiss banknote (the 50-franc note), Sophie Taeuber-Arp was one of the twentieth century’s most innovative artists, in painting, sculpture, textiles, dance, architecture and puppetry. Often occupying this role of “the only woman”—in exhibitions, or when socializing among Dadaists and Concrete artists and elsewhere—Taeuber-Arp nevertheless went about her diverse activities as though gender obstacles were immaterial, and steadily built up a massive body of work whose consistent qualities are warmth, clarity and liveliness. Sophie Taeuber-Arp: Movement and Balance is the most complete survey of the artist’s work available in any language to date. Packed with full-color illustrations of her work in all media, from her pre-Concrete abstractions to her fabrics, watercolors, canvases, reliefs and her wonderful marionettes, as well as a visual chronology with archival photographs of Taeuber-Arp posing in her costumes, or next to her works with her husband Hans (Jean) Arp, this volume demonstrates the exemplary adventurousness of her career.

Edited by Alla Chilova, Beate Kemfert. Text by Evgenia Iluchina, Gleb Pospelow. One of the original “amazons of the Russian avant garde,” Natalia Goncharova (1881–1962) bequeathed a rich and complex body of work to a culture that has only recently begun to recognize it. Like her contemporary Kazimir Malevich, Goncharova drew inspiration from the folklore and art of her country, producing in her early years very colorful and strongly ornamental paintings, as well as religious works influenced by the Russian icon tradition. In the 1910s, Goncharova began experimenting with Cubism, becoming one of the earliest exponents of modern art in Moscow; in 1917, she settled permanently in Paris, where she designed costumes and sets for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. This publication, the first to provide a full overview of Goncharova’s career (including her later, less documented years in Paris) illuminates the trajectory of Goncharova’s career, restoring her work to its former prominence.

# Meret Oppenheim: Fountain Stories Edited by Simon Baur, Martin A. Bühler. Text by Belinda Grace Gardner, Annemarie Monteil.  

More than any other Surrealist, the Swiss artist Meret Oppenheim (1913–1985) embraced, pursued and defined Surrealism’s cult of the object, fashioning such classic works as the famous fur cup (at the age of $23$ !) and the trussed high-heels, infusing everyday domestic objects with a concise eroticism. Yet many facets of her innovative and wide-ranging practice remain unknown to this day, including her extraordinary fountain projects. From the late 1960s until her death, Oppenheim designed and produced models for a series of freewheeling aquatic sculptures. Only three of these have been realized: the “Meret Oppenheim Fountain” in Bern in her native Switzerland, the “Spiral (Nature’s Course)” in Paris and the “Hermes Fountain” located in the garden of artist and onetime collaborator Daniel Spoerri in Seggiano, Italy. Fountain Stories is the first to gather all of Oppenheim’s fountain projects, including her drawings and unrealized models, into a single definitive publication.

# Emil Nolde: Wanderlust Travels through Germany, Spain and Switzerland Edited by Andreas Fluck.  

Published in association with the Nolde Foundation, this is the sixth volume in DuMont’s series devoted to painter Emil Nolde (1867–1956). As a member of Die Brücke (The Bridge), Nolde was known for his vigorous brushwork, rhythmic compositions and extraordinary use of color. A farmer’s son from the German-Danish frontier, Nolde traveled widely throughout Europe: Switzerland, Denmark, France, Italy, Sweden, England, Austria, Belgium, Holland and Spain. While the artist is usually associated with paintings and watercolors of his native gardens in Germany, this latest edition focuses on his European travels and how he translated his wanderlust onto canvas. Guided by imagination, Nolde created an integrated vision of the world that celebrated a love of nature and all that was around him. Featuring mountain panoramas and studies of the people he encountered, Emil Nolde: Wanderlust gives new perspectives on this leading figure in German Expressionism.

# Kurt Schwitters: A Journey Through Art

The influence of Kurt Schwitters (1887–1948) permeates the art, literature and music of the past century as profoundly as any of his contemporaries. Hero of Dada, Constructivist virtuoso, patron saint of collage, sound poetry and installation art, Schwitters made his greatest impact in the postwar era—while he himself was living in relative seclusion in the north of England—influencing American Pop art (especially Robert Rauschenberg’s Combines), Fluxus and assemblage art throughout Europe and America; artists as different as Damien Hirst and Ed Ruscha cite him as an influence. This volume is the first serious broad survey of Schwitters’ work in 25 years, and attests to his omnipresent influence today. It draws on recent research into the “Merzbau” interiors, and gathers all aspects of his output, from collage to typography and architecture, into one glorious testimonial to Schwitters’ libidinously prolific oeuvre. With texts by British art historian Roger Cardinal and Schwitters scholar Gwendolen Webster, this volume presents a new Schwitters for our times.

# Hannah Höch: Picture Book Afterword by Gunda Luyken. Translated by Brian Currid.  

A central figure in the Berlin Dada circle, friend to Kurt Schwitters and Piet Mondrian and lover of Raoul Hausmann, Hannah Höch (1889–1972) is probably the most important female artist from the German modernist period. She is best known for her pioneering works of photomontage, which briskly juxtapose mechanical and organic forms, ancient and contemporary bodies, symbols and text drawn from brands and headlines, also edging feminism, commodity critique and other political concerns into the mix. “It is striking how contemporary to us much of Höch’s work feels,” Luc Sante wrote recently, “in its sexual politics, its humor, its gleeful appropriation of anything and everything at hand.” In 1945, Höch made this fantastical full-color children’s book, which chronicles the adventures of the four mythical creatures Runfast, Dumblet, Snifty and Meyer in an enchanted garden, combining photomontage with the hallucinatory plant imagery she had come to favor. It is published here for the first time.

# Impressionism on the Seine  

Stretching from Paris to Le Havre, the Seine river and the valley flanking it afford some of France’s loveliest views. The ports, holiday homes and artists’ houses, the boats, the washerwomen, the windmills, the open-air cafes, the picnics and the bathing supplied French painting with some of its most iconic images, particularly during the Impressionist era, when painting stepped out of the studio and into the world. It was in this period, as the industrial revolution began to get underway and the landscape began to alter accordingly, through the development of railways, ports and factories, that the rural world it threatened became an increasingly popular subject for painting. This volume brings together 60 paintings painted on the banks of the Seine, retracing the history of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism to Fauvism, from Eugène Boudin to Henri Matisse. En route we encounter such familiar figures as Manet, Renoir, Monet, Pissarro, Sisley and Caillebotte, but also lesser-known figures such as Armand Guillaumin, Henri Rouart and Maximilien Luce.

Text by José María Moreno Martín, Miguel Ángel Puig-Samper, Javier Reverte, Fernando Vallespín. In 1789, Italian-born Spanish naval officer Alejandro Malaspina set off to visit Spain’s colonies in Asia and the Americas. For five years, he and his crew sailed the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, discovering, cataloguing and analyzing flora, fauna, seas, people and lands. The Malaspina Expedition, as it came to be called, anticipated the global spirit of crossdiscipline synergy that defines the twenty-first century. Yet Malaspina’s account of his adventures remained largely unpublished for 100 years. The Malaspina Expedition presents the visual legacy of his expedition, combining maps, illustrations and scientific and artistic documents in the same boundary-crossing spirit as the expedition itself.

# The University A History of Knowledge Transmission Edited by Fernando Tejerina. Text by Josep María Bricall, Manuel Tello León, Mariano Peset, John R. Thelin, et al.  

The passing down of knowledge from one generation to the next is an essential component of civilization, and the university is one of the major vehicles of this process, as a platform for debate, study and the convening of great minds. In The University: A History of Knowledge Transmission, writers and scholars describe the methods and places of knowledge transmission from antiquity to modern times through photographs, period illustrations, artworks, architectural plans and historical documents. The closing chapter discusses the role of universities in the twenty-first century. Written in a concise, readable style. The University records the events, the people and the cities that have shaped the institution we know today.

# Joan Miró: Catalogue Raisonné  

# Lust and Vice The Seven Deadly Sins from Dürer to Nauman Text by Fabienne Eggelhöfer, Christine Göttler, Claudine Metzger, Monique Meyer, Barbara Müller.  

Alongside Picasso and Warhol, Joan Miró (1893–1983) is one of the twentieth century’s most influential artists. Miró created a pictorial world of intense imaginative power, in which visionary and cosmic elements are inextricably intertwined with the earthly and mundane. The research for this colossal catalogue raisonné of Miró’s paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics, spanning the years 1908 to 1981, was begun in 1957; the artist himself and later the Miró Estate (Jacques Dupin, Ariane Lelong-Mainaud and Joan Punyet Miró) were intimately involved in its preparation. Miró’s paintings comprise six volumes, his drawings seven volumes, and his ceramics and sculptures a volume apiece; together, they summate Miró’s entire output in its ravishing glory. All works are reproduced in color where possible, accompanied by their title, date, technique and dimensions, with indication of signature and inscriptions on the back, as well as their collection, provenance, important exhibitions and major publications in which they are reproduced.  

Pride, greed, jealousy, anger, lust, gluttony, sloth: ever since the sixth century A.D., when Pope Gregory designated these vices the seven deadly sins, they have served as a kind of moral index for the Christian world. Lust and Vice brings together some of the most memorable treatments of this litany of offenses. Contributions include the allegories of Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Breughel the Elder, twentieth-century artists such as James Ensor, Alfred Kubin, Marc Chagall and Otto Dix, up through the contemporary imaginings of Bruce Nauman, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons.

# Abstract Expressionism at The Museum of Modern Art Text by Ann Temkin.  

More than 60 years have passed since Robert Coates, writing in the New Yorker in 1946, first used the term “Abstract Expressionism” to describe the richly colored canvases of Hans Hofmann. The name stuck, and over the years it has come to designate the paintings and sculptures of artists as different from one another as Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner and David Smith. The achievements of this generation put New York on the map as the center of the international art world, and constitute some of the twentieth century’s greatest masterpieces. From the mid-1940s, under the aegis of Alfred H. Barr, Jr., works by then little-known American artists—including Pollock, de Kooning, Smith, Arshile Gorky and Adolph Gottlieb—began to enter the Museum’s collection. These ambitious acquisition initiatives continued throughout the second half of the last century and produced a collection of Abstract Expressionist art the breadth and depth of which is unrivalled by any museum in the world. Supplemented by an essay by Ann Temkin, Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA, this volume celebrates the richness of the Museum’s holdings of the paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs from this epochal moment in the history of art and of this institution.

The elegant and exquisitely shaped sculptures of Constantin Brancusi (1876–1957) are easily among the most iconic sculptures created in the twentieth century.“There are those idiots who define my work as abstract,” he once said;“yet what they call abstract is what is most realistic. What is real is not the appearance but the idea, the essence of things.” This volume includes 35 color images; a commentary by Carolyn Lanchner, a former curator of painting and sculpture at MoMA, accompanies each work, elucidating its significance and its context.

# How to Do Things with Art The Meaning of Art’s Performativity By Dorothea von Hantlemann. Edited by Karen Marta. Foreword by Hans Ulrich Obrist.  

Art has never been as culturally and economically prominent as it is today. How can artists themselves shape the social relevance and impact of their work? In How to Do Things with Art, German art historian Dorothea von Hantelmann uses four case study artists—Daniel Buren, James Coleman, Jeff Koons and Tino Sehgal— to examine how an artwork “acts” upon and within social conventions, particularly through the “performing” of exhibitions. The $\mathsf{b o o k^{\prime}s}$ title is a play on J.L. Austin’s seminal text, How to Do Things with Words, which describes language’s “reality-producing” properties and demonstrates that in “saying” there is always a “doing”—a linguistic counterpart to the dynamics envisioned by Von Hantelmann for art, in which “showing” is a kind of “doing.” Von Hantelmann’s close analysis of works by Buren, Coleman, Koons and Sehgal explores how each of these artists has taken control of how their work conducts itself in the world.

# Seen, Written Selected Essays By Klaus Kertess.  

Curator and historian, gallerist and writer: Klaus Kertess has long been a decisive and forwardthinking presence in the art world. He founded the Bykert Gallery in 1966, where he represented artists including Chuck Close, Ralph Humphrey, Brice Marden and Dorothea Rockburne; three decades later, he curated the 1995 Whitney Biennial, the follow-up to the famously political 1993 iteration. “What is being proposed here,” he wrote in a catalogue essay for the 1995 exhibition,“is not a return to formalism but an art in which meaning is embedded in formal value. An acknowledgment of sensuousness is indispensable—whether as play or sheer joy or the kind of subversity that has us reaching for a rose and grabbing a thorn.”The art world has changed considerably from the relatively convivial world of the 60s to today’s globalized milieu, but Kertess has been a constant throughout the years, curating shows of provocative new work and writing critical essays on artists whose work challenges and engages him, while also maintaining a vital literary sideline (his short stories are collected in 2000’s South Brooklyn Casket Company). This volume collects Kertess’ critical works from the past 30 years, including meditations on Agnes Martin, Joan Mitchell, John Chamberlain, Vija Celmins, Chris Ofili and Matthew Richie. With each essay accompanied by full-color reproductions of works discussed, Seen, Written provides a priceless opportunity to see art through the eyes of a lifelong viewer.

Jones, Jakouba Konaté, Gerardo Mosquera, Rafal Niemojewski, et al. Born as a vehicle for national propaganda, the art biennial today has become an outsize phenomenon mobilizing not only artists, curators and gallerists but sponsors, celebrities and politicians, commanding huge press attention and deciding the careers of artists worldwide. For a city to host a biennial today has colossal ramifications. This anthology on the art biennial gathers previously published seminal texts from around the world alongside commissioned contributions from the leading scholars, curators, critics and thinkers today—among them Carlos Basualdo, Daniel Buren, John Clark, Okwui Enwezor, Bruce Ferguson, Milena Hoegsberg, Ranjit Hoskote, Caroline A. Jones, Jakouba Konaté, Gerardo Mosquera and Rafal Niemojewski. Tracing the genealogy of the standard exhibition format— including biennials but also other recurrent exhibitions such as triennials and quadrennials—and examining some of the most famous examples of the twentieth and twenty-first century, from the Venice Biennale to the Johannesburg Biennial and the Havana Bienal to Documenta and the Asian biennials, this “reader” explores the artistic, theoretical, political and other ambitions of such large-scale exhibition projects. It is certain to be a vital resource for scholars, students, curators, artists and critics alike.

# Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Galleries But Were Afraid to Ask  

# By Andrea Bellini.  

The massive expansion of the art market in recent decades has aroused much intrigue about how galleries operate, particularly as critics, artists and independent curators take the lead in opening their own spaces, enhancing the appeal of the gallerist’s role. The primary function of the contemporary gallerist continues to be the one established by D.H. Kahnweiler over a century ago: that of a “traveling companion” to artists, one who nourishes the work’s development, recording it and ensuring its optimum passage into the world. But in today’s economy, the gallerist as cultural entrepreneur and arbiter exercises a professional hybridity far removed from Kahnweiler’s day. Here, Andrea Bellini interviews figures from 51 galleries, including Gavin Brown’s Enterprise (New York), Massimo De Carlo (Milan), Greene Naftali (New York), Hotel (London), Kurimanzutto (Mexico), Franco Noero (Turin), Eva Presenhuber (Zurich), Johann König (Berlin) and Vitamin (Beijing), eliciting their views on the complexities of art culture worldwide.

# Arcana V: Musicians on Music, Magic & Mysticism  

# Edited by John Zorn.  

For centuries musicians have tapped into mysticism, magic and alchemy, embracing ritual, spell, incantation and prayer, and experimenting with esoteric approaches to harmony, pitch and vibration. In recent decades, avant-garde musicians have rediscovered these overlaps, as occultism has reinvented itself— through Buddhist and other Asian influences,Thelema and Chaos Magic—to accommodate cultural strains from psychedelica through Punk and Industrial music. This special edition of John Zorn’s much acclaimed Arcana series focuses on the magical aspects of the act of making music. Neither historical overview nor musicological study, it illuminates the sympathies between music and the esoteric tradition with the help of today’s finest experimental musicians and occultists. Among these are William Breeze, Gavin Bryars, Alvin Curran, Fred Frith, Sharon Gannon, Larkin Grimm, William Kiesel, Yusef Lateef, Frank London, Meredith Monk, Mark Nauseef, Pauline Oliveros, Genesis POrridge,Terry Riley, David Toop, Greg Wall, Peter Lamborn Wilson and Z’ev.

# Stephen Prina: Modern Movie Pop Concerto for Modern, Movie, and Pop Music for Ten Instruments and Voice Edited by Laura Fried.  

For 30 years, Stephen Prina (born 1954) has enjoyed a simultaneous career as a visual artist and as an acclaimed musician, both under his own name and with The Red Krayola. Having kept his artistic interests separate from his musical pursuits for decades, Prina has now begun to synthesize the two endeavors. Presenting recent work in multiple media alongside his music for the first time, Modern Movie Pop pairs an artistdesigned booklet, documenting his exhibition at the Contemporary Art Museum Saint Louis, with a live audio recording of the world premiere of his latest concerto, “Concerto for Modern Movie, and Pop Music for Ten Instruments and Voice” —a complex amalgam of his own pop songs and soundtracks. For this exhibition, Prina achieved the dovetailing of his art and music by suspending richly painted monochrome window blinds behind a carpeted video lounge, creating a “movable stage spectacle.”

# Stephan von Huene: The Song of the Line The Drawings 1950–1999 Edited by Petra Kipphoff von Huene. Text by Marvin Altner, Petra Oelschlägel, Johannes von Müller.  

Stephan von Huene (1932–2000) emerged as a pioneer in sound art in the 1960s alongside John Cage, Ed Kienholz and Allan Kaprow. His mechanical sound sculptures drew on the work of all these artists, combining chance sound with assemblage art and performative happening. Making his mark with visually seductive furniture-like acoustic objects such as the “Kaleidophonic Dog,” that recall the assemblages of Ed Kienholz, von Heune eventually turned his mechanical marvels towards their performative possibilities, involving his listenerviewers in the production of sound. The Song of the Line examines the artist’s works on paper— prints, collages, “mind maps” and sketches—and explicates their relation to his sculptures.

# Ben Patterson: In the State of Fluxus  

Edited by Valerie Cassel Oliver. Text by Valerie Cassel Oliver, Bertrand Clavez, Charles Gaines, Jon Hendricks, Fred Moten, Marcia Reed.  

Performing and visual artist Ben Patterson (born 1934) was a founding member of Fluxus’ participatory, do-it-yourself, anticommercialist avant-garde network. While many Fluxus artists, influenced by John Cage’s precedent, employed conceptual techniques borrowed from music (e.g., the event score), Patterson’s fusion of art and music was informed by his background as a classically trained double-bassist. His “Variations for Double Bass” (1960), for example, was played with the titular instrument balanced upside down on its scroll. Published for a retrospective at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, this volume includes an anthology of Patterson’s scores, edited by Fluxus scholar Jon Hendricks; a chronology of the artist’s life and work; a CD compilation of his musical performances from 1961 to 2009, produced by Alga Marghen; and essays by a variety of scholars, assessing the career of one of Fluxus’ foremost and wittiest artists.

# Daniel Spoerri: Eaten By Text by Dieter Ronte, Wieland Schmied, Christiane Morsbach, Enrico Pedrini.  

Daniel Spoerri was a co-signatory of the Nouveau Réalisme manifesto in 1960, an early member of Fluxus and the author of the classic Anecdoted Topography of Chance, which recorded and annotated the contents of Spoerri’s desk. In 1968 Spoerri also opened Restaurant Spoerri, introducing his concept of “Eat Art,” which he had initiated a decade earlier, and which explored the creation, decay and “trapping” of food upon tables that were then recapitulated as assemblages. Marking the occasion of the artist’s eightieth birthday, Daniel Spoerri: Eaten By approaches the theme of food throughout Spoerri’s oeuvre, from the early 1960s to the present. It includes the artist’s replica of the Restaurant Spoerri, a survey of Spoerri’s trap pictures from 1978 to 1992, and a large number of more recent assemblages and sculptures, bringing his audience fully up to date.

Gathering recipes from cooks and lovers of cooking, Doing-Cooking is a discursive cookbook that unfolds the recipe as a literary form—as a story that unites theory and practice, the preparation of food and the sharing of meals. Each contributor provides a recipe and a proposal of a specific situation for which the recipe might be best suited. This may be a recipe connected to a specific event, an analysis of recipes in relation to a particular culinary circumstance, or even an imaginary tale of the ideal setting for a particular dish. The contributors to this banquet of culinary concepts are Avery Gordon, Damensalon, Nina Freund, FoAM, Chong Boon Pok & Yak Beow Seah, Octavio Camargo, Allen S. Weiss, Celine Condorelli, Fallen Fruit, B.D.C. (Baltimore Development Cooperative), Joaquín Gutiérrez Hadid, Kelly Phillips, e+l and Gaetano Cunsolo. Doing-Cooking reconceives cookery’s most social dimensions, emphasizing the act as a collective practice.

Text by Magdalena Holzhey, Renate Buschmann, Ulrike Groos, Beate Ermacora, Elke Krasny, Nikolai Wojtko, Christiane Boje. In 1968, artist Daniel Spoerri founded Restaurant Spoerri in Düsseldorf; two years later he opened the Eat Art Gallery, where artists such as Joseph Beuys, Roy Lichtenstein and Dieter Roth exhibited objects made of foodstuffs. Taking the activities of Eat Art as its starting point, Eating the Universe gathers together artworks that have been made using edible materials, starting in the 1970s and continuing through to the present day. Over the past decade in particular, artists have evinced a growing interest in food and eating, concomitant with an increasing overall consciousness about the political, ecological, cultural and economic dimensions of what we put in our mouths. With 170 color images, Eating the Universe presents a range of contemporary artwork that explores linkages between food and the formation of identity, societal affluence, globalization and awareness of one’s own body.

# Expanded Edition  

# Minimalism and After Tradition and Tendencies of Minimalism from 1950 to Today  

First published in 2006, and soon out of print, Minimalism and After is a now classic presentation of Minimalist and Postminimalist tendencies from the 1960s to the present day. The images in this hefty volume track some of Minimalism’s major contributions: the essentially sculptural presence of the pictureobject, coolly geometrical structures, works presented so that they relate to the space and the viewer, and a rejection of symbolic or narrative material. In-depth entries treat 190 artists, including 40 who were not included in the 2006 edition, and provide some 600 images of their work; those covered include established artists like Michael Heizer, Dan Graham and Robert Ryman and some of the younger crowd, including Liam Gillick and Michael Zahn. A new essay by Renate Wiehager offers a European account of the century-long development of abstract art from Adolf Hoelzel’s 1906 class at the Stuttgart Academy to the present.

# Personal Structures: Time-Space-Existence Edited by Peter Lodermeyer, Karlyn de Jongh, Sarah Gold  

Guided by the principle that throughout the world artists are independently working through the same problems and themes, this publication seeks to convene these artists to examine the diversity of formal vocabularies brought to bear upon those problems. Personal Structures includes over 35 artist interviews on the topics of time, space and existence within their work, plus transcripts from four symposia in different cities: “Time” in Amsterdam, “Space” in New York,“Existence” in Tokyo and “Time-Space-Existence” at the 53rd Venice Biennale. Personal Structures presents the work of 60 artists between the ages of 20 and 90 from 17 countries on four continents. Among the artists represented are Marina Abramovi´c, Vito Acconci, Carl Andre, Christian Boltanski, Louise Bourgeois, Hanne Darboven, Liam Gillick, Antony Gormley, Dan Graham, Tehching Hsieh, On Kawara, Joseph Kosuth, Sol LeWitt, Giuseppe Penone, Jessica Stockholder, Richard Tuttle, Lawrence Weiner and Fred Wilson.

# Gender Check  

Femininity and Masculinty in the Art of Eastern Europe Preface by Edelbert Köbb, Rainer Fuchs, Agnieszka Morawinska. Text by Boris Marte, Christine Böhler, Bojana Pejic, et al.  

How were workers depicted on Socialist posters? How were male “heroes” portrayed in officially sanctioned art in Romania in the 1960s? How did female artists see themselves during the transition period after 1989? How do images impact on our view of the sexes? Gender Check reflects ideas of masculinity and femininity in the former Communist bloc, 20 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, looking at both official and unofficial art from the Baltics to the Caucasus, from the 1960s to the decisive events of 1989 to the present. It is published in conjunction with a traveling exhibition that includes a selection of paintings, sculptures, photographs, posters, installations, films and videos by over 200 artists, making it an important addition to contemporary gender discourse.

In SITE Santa Fe’s Eighth   
International Biennial, held in 2010, curated by Sarah Lewis and Daniel Belasco, emerging and established artists working in many media displayed works that mined techniques of early animation and moving  
image technologies to create a   
hybrid practice of homespun plus high-tech. This exquisitely designed volume arising from the event is   
titled The Dissolve, a title that points both at this new sensibility emerging from the old and at the two-way nature of the dissolve in moving   
images as both ephemeral and generative. The Dissolve presents art by Robert Breer, Paul Chan, Martha

# The Storyteller Edited by Claire Gilman, Margaret Sundell. Text by T.J. Demos, Okwui Enwezor, Claire Gilman.  

Amid the popularity of documentary practices in contemporary art, The Storyteller addresses the use of storytelling as a means of exploring recent political events. For the artists in this volume, the story operates neither as a purely imaginary conceit nor as an item of verifiable information. In some cases, it may take the form of an invented drama based on real events; in others, it adopts literary genres such as the fairy tale or the quest; in still others, a dialogue is conceived between active participants in a contemporary political situation. Edited by Claire Gilman and Margaret Sundell, The Storyteller includes works by Cao Fei, Jeremy Deller and Mike Figgis, Omer Fast, Mounir Fatmi, Ryan Gander, Lamia Joreige, Joachim Koester, Emanuel Licha, Missing Books, Steve Mumford, Adrian Paci, Michael Rakowitz, Liisa Roberts and Hito Steyerl.

SoCCAS Symposium Vol. IV Edited and with introduction by John C. Welchman. Text by Jessica Chalmers, Janet Whitmore, Simon Critchley. Black Sphinx collects 12 essays on comedy in contemporary art by leading philosophers, art historians and theorists. Philosopher Simon Critchley and art historian Janet Whitmore consider the origins of comedic genres and survey some of the key theoretical articulations of laughter and wit, by Freud, Bergson and others; John C. Welchman focuses on John Baldessari, a touchstone for the revival of humor in art in the 1960s; performer, playwright and former V-Girl Jessica Chalmers and writer and curator Jo Anna Issak, discuss the relation between comedy and gender; finally, artist and writer David Robbins reports on his decade-long investigation into the comedic properties of objects, while video and performance artist Michael Smith reflects on his hilariously awkward and regressive journeys with his alter persona “Mike.” Black Sphinx is based on the fourth Southern California Consortium of Art Schools symposium, held at the Hammer Museum.

# The Encyclopedia of Fictional Artists Edited by Koen Brams, Krist Gruijthuisen.  

First published nearly a decade ago, and here translated into English for the first time, The Encyclopedia of Fictional Artists is a project by author and editor Koen Brams, for which he commissioned and compiled an anthology of imaginary biographies based on the numerous artists invented by writers across the centuries, from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the present. The imaginary artist is, of course, a supremely seductive figure to readers, writers and artists alike, being a sort of screen upon which the most astounding imaginary creations may be projected, without need of them ever being visible to the eye. As such, The Encyclopedia of Fictional Artists constitutes a trove of inspiration for all manner of creative endeavor. The Addition is Krist Gruijthuisen’s editorial answer to the Encyclopedia, in which he invites more than 20 artists to reflect on the aspirations and ideals of encyclopedias. The two volumes are held together by a bellyband.

The Performative Impulse in Art and Craft   
Edited by Valerie Cassel Oliver. Text by Glenn Adamson, Valerie Cassel Oliver, Namita Wiggers.  

Hand + Made: The Performative Impulse in Art and Craft assesses the latest developments in the everincreasing overlap between contemporary art and craft. Through the incorporation of performance, the artists featured in this volume have not only broadened the context and function of the handmade object itself, but also usefully blurred the distinctions between the genres of the performing and sculptural arts. The 19 artists featured in this book have either sought to animate the handmade object by using it as an instrument of performance; to extend its impact through public interventions; or to propose their works as residuals of spectacles or happenings. The participating artists are B Team, Conrad Bakker, Nick Cave, Cat Chow, Gabriel Craig, Theaster Gates, Cynthia Giachetti, Ryan Gothrup, Sabrina Gschwandtner, Lauren Kalman, Christy Matson, James Melchert, Yuka Otani, Sheila Pepe, Michael Rea, Anne Wilson, Saya Woolfalk, and Bohyun Yoon.

# The New Décor Edited with an introduction by Ralph Rugoff. Text by Hal Foster, Michelle Kuo, Kirsty Bell, Christy Lange, Skye Sherwin.  

The New Décor gathers a range of contemporary artists whose work takes the vocabulary of interior design as a point of departure. Reconceptualizing the decoration of our everyday environments through sculpture and installation, these artists explore, and sometimes dismantle, the current attitudes and the social furniture that reveal the public dimensions of our private worlds. In French the word “décor” refers to stage and film sets as well as interior design, and in a similar spirit the works in this volume occupy an arena midway between theater and everyday life. Remapping our relationships to a variety of interior spaces, the artists contributing to this volume are Monica Bonvicini, Martin Boyce, Tom Burr, Marc Camille Chaimowicz, Los Carpinteros, Jimmie Durham, Elmgreen & Dragset, Urs Fischer, Gelitin, Fabrice Gygi, Mona Hatoum, Diango Hernández, Yuichi Higashionna, Jim Lambie, Lee Bul, Sarah Lucas, Ernesto Neto, Manfred Pernice, Ugo Rondinone, Doris Salcedo, Jin Shi, Roman Signer, Pascale Marthine Tayou, Rosemarie Trockel, Tatiana Trouvé, Haegue Yang, Nicole Wermers and Franz West.

”I have gathered a garland of other men s flowers,” the French philosopher Montaigne famously wrote, and nothing is mine but the cord that binds them.” The first decade of the twenty-first century appears to belong to the collagist, for whom the creative act is not creation” sui generis, but rather the collecting, cutting and pasting of the already extant. Collage, which began as an art meant to confound the brain with its disparate components, has jumped the flat surface, so that almost all musicians, designers, writers and bloggers might today be described as collage artists. Collage Culture contains two essays, buttressed by artworks and vividly typeset by Brian Roettinger. The first essay, by Mandy Kahn, chronicles collage’s forays into the realms of music, fashion, literature and architecture. The second, by Aaron Rose, examines what he sees as the neutralization of countercultural energies in today’s pic ‘n’ mix world.

Street and Studio From Basquiat to Seripop Edited by Cathérine Hug, Gerald Matt, Thomas Miessgang. Text by Dieter Buchhart. Interviews with Rita Ackermann, Charlie Ahearn, Tamra Davis, Ari Marcopoulos, Glenn O’Brien, et al. The street as a stage or site of creative action has acquired its own special role in art history: think of Jean-Michel Basquiat, whose work stemmed directly from street culture, or Mark Jenkins irritating pedestrians with his subtle infiltration of human-like sculptures, or the participatory installations of Kader Attia. Each of the 30 artists contributing to this volume has found ways to weave art strategies into the fabric of street culture. Street and Studio focuses on the street as a zone of creativity, and as a source of inspiration to young artists whose lives and art are marked by an urban and mobile lifestyle.

# Ten Takes on Chinese Tradition Text by Hao Sheng, Joe Scheier-Dolberg, Yan Yang.  

Contemporary Chinese society has been called a culture at the crossroads of the past and the future, and nowhere is this tension more apparent than in Chinese ink painting today. Artists working in this highly traditional medium draw from a wealth of ancient themes, but must resolve them within contemporary Chinese culture. In Fresh Ink, ten of China’s leading contemporary artists engage directly with the past by creating ten new works in response to older masterpieces, ranging from classical Chinese scrolls to a scholar’s rock to a drip painting by Jackson Pollock. Their personal visions reflect diverse concerns and influences, whether Xu Bing’s play on the absurdly monumental, Qin Feng’s system of communicative signs, or the keen eye for society evident in the work of Li Jin, Yu Hong and Liu Xiaodong. An adventurous pairing of contemporary artworks with their forbears, Fresh Ink blurs the boundaries between traditional and contemporary, East and West.

# A History of Art in 20th Century China By Lü Peng.  

Preface by Bruce Gordon Doar, Fan Jingzhong.  

In Lü Peng’s A History of Art in 20th Century China, we at last possess a comprehensive and definitive account of the extraordinary development of Chinese art in the last century, written by its foremost expert. In over 1,200 pages of fully illustrated close analysis, Lü Peng traces the evolution of modern Chinese art, tackling its emergence not only in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, but also in such important expat centers as Paris and Tokyo. Among the many artists encountered en route are Huang Yongping, Gu Wenda, Xu Bing, Zhang Xiaogang, Wang Guangyi, Fang Lijun, Yue Minjun, Zhou Chunya and over 200 other artists.

# He Sen: Paintings  

Chinese painter He Sen (born 1968) has been gaining increased attention for his exquisite photorealist paintings of young women. His subjects wear lingerie or pajamas as they strike naively seductive poses and fix languid stares off into the distance. He’s paintings blatantly mobilize nymphet sexuality, yet the only moments of color come from inanimate commodities: copper bracelets, a splash of pink lipstick.

# Wu Yi  

Text by Fan Di’an, Wang Lin, Chen Xiaoxin.  

Drawn to the spiritual impulses of the Chinese classical ink painting tradition, Wu Yi (born 1966) quietly updates the genre with interpolations of present-day China. Skillfully manipulating washes of aerated but glorious color, the artist weaves historical events and tiered narratives.

Wei Qingji (born 1971) is a leading member of China’s experimental ink painting movement. Utilizing his profound knowledge of traditional techniques, the artist incorporates corporate logos, along with elements from graffiti, Pop art and erotica, to explore the confrontation between contemporary China’s appetite for western materialism and its commitment to its own rich cultural past.

Confronting contemporary African art’s awkward coexistence with earlier African art as “ethnographic artifact,” Geo-Graphics celebrates the flourishing of African art on the international circuit, while simultaneously asserting its ancestry and critiquing the valorization of heritage.

# Parkett No. 87: Cerith Wyn Evans, Katharina Fritsch, Annette Kelm, Kelley Walker  

Parkett continues its 25th anniversary with a text by Marina Warner on the Trans-Atlantic cable; a persuasive argument by Richard Phillips for the faux-naïf painter Adolf Dietrich $(1877-1957)$ ; and Philip Kaiser’s examination of the Met’s recent Pictures Generation show. London-based Cerith Wyn Evans is perhaps best known for his hypnotic neon signs; as Michael Archer notes, Walter Benjamin saw content not just in the sign but in its reflection. Both Pablo Lafuente and Jan Verwoert name London’s “magnetic fields” of the 1970s as a major influence. Katharina Fritsch is best known for her monochromatic figures cast in plaster. Jessica Morgan sees these immaculately articulated forms as “amplifications,” while JeanPierre Criqui responds to just the opposite: their ghostliness. Annette Kelm’s photographs possess a frightening sense of obsolescence; according to Beatrix Ruf, their baffling stories begin with a detail that seems to have lost its potency. Kelley Walker’s work embraces contradiction and contrast, as Johanna Burton witnessed upon viewing the eclectic collection of artifacts and memorabilia in his studio. Antek Walczak evaluates Walker’s appropriation of the recycling logo, and Glenn Ligon addresses the anxiety behind his African-American imagery. Allen Ruppersberg supplies an insert for the issue.

# Conjunctions: 55, Urban Arias Edited by Bradford Morrow.  

Some people hate them, others are terrified of them. Still others find them filthy, noisy, congested, ugly and downright uninhabitable. But those who choose to live in cities often have a far more complex relationship with their steel and glass environment—an attachment that often mingles irritation with affection, fear with calm, a desire to leave with the imperative to stay. This bond between city dwellers and their metropolitan milieux lies at the heart of Urban Arias. Downtowns, uptowns, midtowns; parks, ghettoes, museums—the rich gamut of what constitutes one of the oldest experiments in human habitation stands at the center of this special issue. Among the two dozen contributors to Urban Arias are Elizabeth Hand, Paul La Farge, Jonathan Lethem, Karen Russell and Luc Sante, along with a previously unpublished interview with Thomas Bernhard, in which the uneasy relationship between rural and urban life is discussed.

# Cabinet 38: Islands Edited by Sina Najafi.  

The seclusion of islands has long made them ideal screens for our fantasies and terrors, choice locations for military and scientific assays, and perfect settings for escapes, incarcerations and battles for survival. In consideration of these dynamics, Cabinet 38 features Julia Wolcott discussing islands in science fiction; Jeffrey Kastner on being marooned; Janet Connelly on West Berlin as an island; Simon Rezak on island penal colonies; the story of the Chinese “Princess” Der Ling, a onetime student of Isadora Duncan who set up court on a Mexican island in the 1920s; and an artist project by Jeremy Drummond. Off-the-island treasures include Anthony Grafton on the Last Supper’s culinary legacy; Aaron Schuster on cinematic sneezes; Jonathan Hardy on the Spanish urban grid; Maggie Nelson on the color red; George Pendle on the first computer dating system; Allen S. Weiss on Japanese garden design; and an artist project by Alejandro Cesarco.

# Cabinet 39: Learning Edited by Sina Najafi.  

What is learning? An excruciating struggle with techniques and facts? A sensation of joyful encounter with the hitherto unknown? The very notion of the pedagogical conjures a whole range of emotions, and its implications are evident throughout society—for what is culture, after all, but the transmission of knowledge? The thematic section of Cabinet 39 features an interview with John Haynes, pioneer of the modern instruction manual; Jeff Dolven outlining the theater of pedagogy; Elaine Traub tracing the history of “distance learning”; Sina Najafi tracking the development of the A–F grading system; and an interview with Zoë Readhead, principal of Summerhill, the world’s first “free school.” Elsewhere in the issue: Michael Shipley on voice experts used by the police and security services; Emily Walters on boots and colonialism; Suzanne Scott on the history of suntanning; Kris Lee on Kierkegaard and the promotional blurb; and Katrin Arnardottir on the sex lives of Icelandic elves.

# Andrew Moore: Detroit Disassembled, Limited Edition Text by Philip Levine.  

No longer the Motor City of boom-time industry, the city of Detroit has fallen into an incredible state of dilapidation since the postwar decline of the American auto industry. Today, whole sections of the city resemble a war zone, its once-spectacular architectural grandeur reduced to vacant ruins. In Detroit Disassembled, photographer Andrew Moore records a territory in which the ordinary flow of time—or the forward march of the assembly line—appears to have been thrown spectacularly into reverse. For Moore, who throughout his career has been drawn to all that contradicts or seems to threaten America’s postwar self-image (his previous projects include portraits of Cuba and Soviet Russia), Detroit’s decline affirms the carnivorousness of our earth, as it seeps into and overruns the buildings of a city that once epitomized humankind’s supposed supremacy. This limited edition of Detroit Disassembled comes with a numbered and signed photo by the photographer ( $15\times12$ inches) and is housed in a linen cloth box.

# Greg Gorman: In Their Youth, Limited Edition Text by Peter Weiermair.  

In Their Youth: Early Portraits comprises over 200 of the California-based photographer’s previously unpublished portraits from the last three decades, featuring famous actors shot when they were still unknown young men, from teen years into their early twenties. “I decided to do a project that expressed my infatuation with male beauty,” Gorman explains, “especially in terms of youth... the portraits don’t have lots of backgrounds, they’re straightforward. It’s really about the person, not the elements. It boils down to the graphics of the individual more than the graphics of the setting.” Gorman’s intimate celebrity portraits hinge on the sense of his subjects’ vulnerability. Here, famous young men are juxtaposed with photographs of promising unknowns: one of the first shots of Tom Cruise, for instance, shares a spread with some anonymous ephebe that Andy Warhol met at Studio $54$ . This limited edition comes with a numbered and signed photograph of Christopher Atkins (13 x 17 inches), signed by both Atkins and Gorman, and comes housed in a linen cloth box.

# Mark Ryden: The Tree Show, Limited Edition  

Los Angeles artist Mark Ryden combines the arcane with pop-cultural imagery, as ground from which to make his carefully executed leaps into fantasy.

This special edition of Mark Ryden’s bestselling The Tree Show features works from the artist’s major solo exhibition at the Michael Kohn Gallery in Los Angeles.

Edited and with Introduction by David Jury. Preface by Peter R. Koch. Text by Sarah Bodman, Felipe Ehrenberg, Stefan Soltek, Robert Bringhurst, Crispen Elsted, Markus Fahrner, Martha Hellion, Jadwiga Jarvis, Gerald Lange.  

Book Art Object may be the most ambitious and diverse survey of artist’s books and the book arts published to date.

Stalwarts of the artist’s book circuit such as Brad Freeman and Granary Books are represented here, as well as newer artist’s book publishers such as Dobbin Mill, Otis Laboratory Press and Red Trillum Press. Also well represented are small literary presses such as Chax Press, Arion Press, Indulgence Press and Nikodim Publishing. A visual record of the proceedings and exhibitors attending the first biennial Codex International Book Fair and Symposium, Book Art Object collects work by many of the world’s most esteemed printers, book artists and artisans into a single satisfying volume.

# Marlene Dumas: Against the Wall  

The lyrically charged paintings of Marlene Dumas (born 1953) eulogize the frailties of the human body, probing themes of love, melancholy and confusion even as they slyly critique racial and gender prejudice. Dumas’ particular gift is to freight the haunting handling of her imagery with a political and/or sexual edge. Famed internationally (especially since her Museum of Modern Art retrospective of 2008) after three decades of perfecting her vulnerable and poised style, Dumas continues to evolve these universal themes of love and loss. Her newest series, titled Against the Wall, is comprised of large-scale paintings that include scenes of mourning mothers at the Western Wall in Jerusalem (also known as the Wailing Wall). Published on the occasion of Dumas’ exhibition at David Zwirner, Dumas’ first at the gallery, only a few copies of Against the Wall are available, making it certain to quickly become a collector’s item.

# Yoko Ono: Fly Me  

”Sky people, that’s what we are,” Yoko Ono sang, in the 1985 song “Sky People”; “One day we’ll fly and leap through the sky/To look for a good land hand in hand.” Now, through the auspices of Ecstatic Peace Library, Yoko Ono has fulfilled these words and devised a book to fly in her stead. Published as a limited edition, Fly Me is a handbound book that unfolds to become a kite featuring seven pages of individual messages or instructions composed by Ono. These messages are designed to be read by all, in the sky on a windy day. You simply unfold the page you wish to fly and attach the paper to the bamboo frame included to construct a massive $(30\times36$ inch) diamond-shaped kite. Including such characteristic Ono advice as “Imagine Peace” and “Fly,” these messages are printed with soy-based inks on 100% recycled paper. The kite frame itself is made of handcarved oak from a sustainable forest in New York state. A marvelous addition to Ono’s already classic oeuvre of innovative bookmaking, Fly Me is published in a limited edition of 2,500 copies, and is without doubt an instant collector’s gem.

# Andreas Herzau: Istanbul Text by Elif Safak.  

Prompted by the debate surrounding Turkey’s potential membership in the European Union, German photographer Andreas Herzau (born 1962) began documenting life in the country.

Negative film can only be exposed to a certain point, beyond which the photochemical process is reversed and the negative’s darkest areas become light again. For Hans-Christian Schink’s series 1h, a 1955 picture by Minor White, titled “Black Sun,” was a source of inspiration. 1h employs an effect called “real solarization.” For 1h, Schink deliberately chose to combine this process with a very long exposure, acheiving effects of abstraction and blur.

# Who is Architecture: The 2009 Domus China Interviews Conversations on the Borders of Building  

Edited by Brendan McGetrick. Text by Mark Wigley, Barry Bergdoll, Michael Rock, Lu Zhenggang. Architecture is a collaborative art, calling on the efforts of not only architects but also engineers, developers, plumbers, electricians and others. The production process must balance individual empowerment and general management to allow for meaningful dialogue between diverse professionals. Who Is Architecture explores these interactions through ten interviews with professionals who contribute to architecture in various ways. Conducted by the acclaimed writer and editor Brendan McGetrick, and originally published as a series for the Chinese edition of Domus magazine, these conversations illustrate the many facets of architectural practice. Interview subjects include: Michael Rock (Founder of the graphic design firm 2x4), Lu Zhenggang (Founder of the digital rendering company Crystal CG), Barry Bergdoll (Curator of Architecture and Design at The Museum of Modern Art, New York), Mark Wigley (Dean of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation) and Tan Xiaochun (Chief of Construction for China’s National Stadium).

The Fassianos Building in Athens, by Kyriakos Krokos (1941–1998), proved to be an experimental ground for the architectural visions and details that would later define his career. Few designs have ever transformed an otherwise banal building into such a radically different reality.

# Less is Future 19 Cities—19 Themes International Building Exhibition Urban Redevelopment Saxony-Anhalt 2010  

A massive reduction in population and collosal overhaul of economic structure have presented enormous challenges for the people of east Germany over the past 20 years. As part of the International Building Exhibition Urban Redevelopment 2010, 19 towns and cities in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt have implemented a series of innovative projects and formulated proposals as to how the ever-shrinking towns and cities of east Germany could be redesigned to accommodate their present status. This book provides a general view of the methods, methodology and results of this investigation. A historical review of the urban developments of the last two decades show the causes of urban reduction and the IBA’s earliest solutions, and three scenarios on the themes of town, landscape and climate outline questions and possible developments for Saxony-Anhalt up to the year 2050. With the IBA, Saxony-Anhalt has also instigated “a laboratory for the city of tomorrow,” to sustain this project well into the future.

# Hans Venhuizen: Game Urbanism Handbook of Processes of Spatial Change Edited by Hans Venhuizen. Text by Charle Landry, Francien van Westrenen.  

Across Europe, cities are rapidly changing. How to account for the requirements of culture and humanity amid urban planners’ brisk intentions? Hans Venhuizen is a specialist in what he calls culture-based planning, which takes existing culture—architecture, art and the contemporary culture of an area’s inhabitants—as the point of departure for planning efforts. Venhuizen is well known for his use of ingenious large-scale social games to identify the culture and explore the interests at stake: one such game, called “Life, the Game,” involved 20 participants in reenacting the entire life cycle. Game Urbanism: Handbook of Processes of Spatial Change presents Venhuizen’s working practices and shows how they can be applied by anybody (citizens, planners, artists, architects, local authorities, administrators) working in spatial planning, architecture, community arts or other creative industries. Charles Landry, author of the highly influential The Creative City (2000) and The Art of City Making (2006), contributes an introduction.

# Sergei Tchoban: Architectural Worlds Draftsman and Collector Edited by Eva-Maria Barkhofen.  

Russian-German architect Sergei Tchoban (born 1962) is well-known for his virtuoso skills as a draftsman; for over 30 years he has also been a passionate collector of architectural drawings. This publication unites Tchoban’s own drawings—which range from perspectivalillusionist representations of his hometown of St. Petersburg to travel impressions, fantasies and visionary architectural studies—with highlights from his collection of works by European architects and painters dating from the seventeenth century, including Ferdinando Galli Bibiena (1656–1743), Filippo Juvara (1678–1736) and Jacques-Louis David $(1748-1825)$ Focusing on motifs of ancient, classicist and Baroque architecture, these works establish a fruitful dialogue with Tchoban’s correspondingly broad production. Through these extraordinary examples of “paper architecture”—a fascinating but somewhat neglected critical genre—this book underscores the endless possibilities for expression in the medium and promises to delight any reader interested in architecture or the graphic arts.

# Isabella Hollauf: Spaces for Recreation  

Utopian models for urban planning have noticeably declined in popularity since the late 1970s, and their decline has led to the neglect of vestigial social pilot projects—simple leisure facilities like parks and public swimming pools. Austrian photographer Isabella Hollauf (born 1956) traces a changing value system by visiting these orphaned sites, contrasting former utopian hopes with the dismal reality of today’s less ambitious aspirations.

# Post-Mining Landscape Conference Documentation  

What other post-industrial landscape affords the possibility of being so completely overhauled, from its very soil mix to the edifices erected upon it? In 2009, the IBA conference “Opportunity: PostMining Landscapes” addressed these and related themes. Examining former mining sites in Europe, the $\mathsf{U}.\mathsf{S}.,$ Chile, South Africa and China, the proceedings of this conference demonstrate the fertile opportunities of these landscapes.

# Positions Photography of Architecture, City and Landscape in the Netherlands Edited by Simon Franke, Allard Jolles, Piet Vollaard. Photographs by Theo Baart, Bas Princen, Ralph Kämena, Jannes Linders, Jeroen Musch, Hans Werlemann.  

Positions addresses the ascent of architectural photography as a discipline, and the changing role of the architectural photographer. Once merely charged with providing a “purely documentary” representation of a building, the architectural photographer now offers a personal interpretation of the work of the architect, urban planner or landscape designer—what the editors of this volume term “commissioned interpretive photography,” which raises the question of what “working on assignment” might mean. The common factor that unites the photographers presented here—Theo Baart, Bas Princen, Ralph Kämena, Jannes Linders, Jeroen Musch and Hans Werlemann—is that each of them has brought a highly personal perspective to bear upon their approach to their commissions, and that each of their oeuvres has had a direct impact on contemporary architecture and urban planning. Positions examines the photographer’s emancipation from documentary constraint to creative agency. A “selective historiography” provides an overview of the development of architectural photography on commission, and further texts describe methods of collaboration between photographer and architect.

# Simplicity Essential Ambiguities By Pierre Charpin & Mathieu Mercier. Text by Luca Marchetti, Emanuele Quinz.  

Simplicity is a dialogue between industrial designer Pierre Charpin and artist Mathieu Mercier on the theme of the “necessary minimum.” Both have brought a reductive imperative to bear upon their respective disciplines—Charpin with his insistence on minimalist design efficiency, and Mercier with his interrogations of everyday life at the limits of art, architecture and design.

# WALTHER KÖNIG, KÖLN  

# Sixties Fashion Edited by Adelheid Rasche.  

Miniskirts, jeans, flares, pantsuits and Asian clothing— the fashion revolution of the 1960s has not yet ceased to reverberate, returning year after year to reinvent the discoveries of that decade. It was in the 1960s that London took over Paris’ long-held crown as the trendsetting capital, as Britain’s teen culture exploded amid the birth of rock music and the sexual revolution, with pantsuits, denim, various types of Asian garb and the scandalous mini-skirt becoming accordingly ubiquitous. This decade also saw a boom in European tourism, as Germans gravitated en masse to Italy for the first time and beach and bathing wear became more revealing and casual than ever before. All of these seismic shifts in the (literal) fabric of everyday life were of course amplified by an increasingly powerful global media network, leading to an attendant explosion in the practice and popularity of fashion photography and illustration, and to the phenomenon of the “it girl” and the supermodel. This book traces the couture revolution of the 1960s across 12 thematic sections, building its portrait of the decade through the fashion photography of the era’s virtuosos—among them Guy Bourdin, Hubs Flöter, F.C. Gundlach, Ursula Knipping, Helmut Newton, Rico Puhlmann, Regi Relang and Jeanloup Sieff—and fashion illustrations by the likes of Antonio, René Gruau, Lilo Kittel, Trude Rein and Walter E. Voigt.

# Ferdinand Porsche: Inventor of the Hybrid Car  

Although Toyota is known for creating the first gas-electric car, Porsche was in the business long before the Prius existed: in 1900, at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, Ferdinand Porsche caused a sensation by presenting an electric automobile. The forthcoming Porsche hybrid SUV continues this tradition of innovation. This volume includes unpublished pictures and documents from the Porsche archive.

In a multistory factory at Zuffenhausen, welding robots and skilled employees assemble the auto body of each Porsche car at $4,600$ welding spots, whereupon the partially-completed autos travel between buildings by way of elevators and a raised conveying bridge that crosses one of the campus’s main drags. In other parts of the campus, workers create the engines and carefully inspect the leather seat coverings, while tests in a “wetroom” ensure the new Porsche is watertight. Zuffenhausen documents the historical development of the Porsche production site.

# 22 Ways To Say Black  

Until Coco Chanel came along, black was usually only worn by women on occasions of mourning; in the late nineteenth century, when worn outside such occasions, black clothing was even considered indecent (as instanced by the controversy attending John Singer Sargent’s “Portrait of Madame X”). But in 1926, Chanel overturned centuries of convention by publishing a photograph in an issue of Vogue of a dress she had designed that came to be known as “the little black dress” (or “LBD”). Chanel’s little black dress was cut simply, usually featured a short skirt, and was designed primarily for durability, affordability and versatility. An immediate hit with women from across the social spectrum, the popularity of the little black dress persisted even into the Great Depression, and for nearly a century it has continued to symbolize the modern woman, flourishing through every decade where most dresses would flounder (Vogue once described it as “Chanel’s Model-T Ford”). Among the many celebrities who have made it a part of their personal style are Audrey Hepburn, Betty Boop, Wallis Simpson and Edith Piaf. Here, in celebration of this classic garment’s enduring appeal, Swarovski AG has commissioned 22 of today’s leading fashion designers, including Giorgio Armani, Vivienne Westwood, Donna Karan and Jean-Paul Gaultier, to design one little black dress apiece. All dresses will be sold at auction, at Phillip’s New York gallery during Fashion Week Fall 2010. 22 Ways To Say Black pays homage to the legacy of Chanel’s masterpiece, illustrating all 22 dresses in lavishly staged photographs. A limited quantity of this title is available.

# Benedetta Tagliabue: Nearly Ninety  

When Merce Cunningham (1919–2009) was preparing a performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday, he turned to industrial designer Benedetta Tagliabue for the stage decor. The set Cunningham and Tagliabue constructed for the piece, Nearly Ninety—which would, sadly, turn out to be the final work of Cunningham’s career— was a 22-foot-tall silver structure bisected by a winding staircase. This book documents this final work of Cunningham’s stagecraft.

The palindromic title of Brazilian artist Carla Zaccagnini’s no, it is opposition. hints at its conceptual structure, which she describes as “forking paths and crossroads.”The book documents an exhibition which the viewer enters twice, encountering the “same” work again, but differently. The exhibition catalogue reflects the palindromic nature of the exhibition, mirroring itself and the exhibition in both structure and form.

# Björn Braun: Nest Text by Veit Loers, Hilke Wagner, Uwe Fröhlich, Bettina Klein.  

For his paper collages, Björn Braun (born 1979) carefully cuts out photographs from old illustrated books and reassembles them in fresh ways: a mountain range might grow out of the shingles of a church roof. Braun’s sculptural works follow a similar logic—nothing can be destroyed unless something new is created from it.

# Leni Hoffmann: RGB Edited by Katia Baudin. Text by Kasper König.  

German artist Leni Hoffmann (born 1962) revisits the potentials of modernist and avant-garde (particularly Russian Constructivist) painting, but using materials such as concrete, ceramic and plastic tarps. Returning to the aspirations of El Lissitzky and Alexander Rodchenko, Hoffmann in turn questions the social neutrality of art, through colorful site-specific installations that extend painting into architectural space and everyday life.

# Valentin Carron: Learning from Martigny  

Neither authentic nor kitsch, readymade nor traditional craft, the works of Swiss artist Valentin Carron (born 1975) play with material ambiguity— fake wood, fake concrete, fake bronze—to unpack the iconography of power and authority. Learning from Martigny offers photographic source material intertwined with images of his sculptures and paintings.

# Uwe Karlsen: Monte Rosa Edited by Niels Dietrich. Text by Raimund Stecker.  

German artist Uwe Karlsen (born 1954) approaches sculpture as an act of both manipulation and spontaneity; to this end, he drops masses of clay onto thick plates of steel, and through this collision, allows the material release its energy with visible force. The final outcome is coated with glaze. This monograph surveys Karlsen’s experiments in dynamism.

# Markus Karstiess: Night Ego Text by Magdalena Kröner, Carl Friedric Schröer.  

Like three-dimensional Rorschach blots, the work of German artist Markus Karstiess (born 1971) engages the viewer in a psychological game of associations. His suggestively craggy ceramic vessels, completed with live flowers, evoke sensual primeval landscape, while their heavily worked metallic surfaces simultaneously evoke the Futurist sculptures of Umberto Boccioni.

# Annette Streyl: Idols Edited by Alexander Sarailly. Text by Harald Falckenberg, Dagrun Hintze, Petra Roettig.  

Using primarily wool and sandstone, German artist Annette Streyl (born 1968) creates whimsical replicas of the built world: she has knitted versions of Berlin’s Great Hall, McDonald’s franchises and an Ikea superstore, to demystify the grandeur of architecture. Her burnt clay sculptures depicting medieval busts reimagine the historical relationship between craft, fine art and ornamentation.

Before studying at the Academy of the Visual Arts in Munich, Benjamin Bergmann (born 1968) trained as a wood sculptor for church decoration. From 2001 onwards, Bergmann devised environments using materials ranging from repurposed windows to bicycles—self-contained dream worlds that exemplify Harald Szeemann’s concept of “individual mythologies.”

The Beninese assemblage virtuoso Romuald Hazoumè (born 1962) transforms plastic jugs and other discarded materials into masks and sculptural installations that explore the nexus of ritual and industrialization. Hazoumè mines the space of economic and psychic transaction between Africa and Europe—both the literal exchange of goods and the mutual delusion that paradise lies within the other.

Dexter Dalwood’s canvases usually begin their lives as small collages, culled from magazines and art history books. In the subsequent large-scale works, the sense of abrupt disjunction remains, repurposing the genre of history painting to express the complex nature of iconicity in our age. This first overview of Dalwood’s work includes paintings and collages made over the last 12 years.

# Dan Attoe: I Made Most of This Shit Up  

For seven years, Dan Attoe (born 1975) made one painting every weekday: figurative, trippy vignettes of modern American life. He has since expanded the criteria to include sketches for his psychosexual neon works and drawings. The artist views this rigorous schedule as an almost anthropological recording of his intellectual and artistic development.

# Lars Elling: Palimpsest Introduction by Joshua Ferris.  

In the outsize canvases of Norwegian painter Lars Elling (born 1966), human bodies rarely take entirely conventional form. Rather, their faces and limbs melt into nonfigurative elements— blurred color, scrubbed-out regions of neutral tint—gesturing toward a broader horizon, nodding at persona and narrative while ultimately frustrating any drive toward coherence or story. Palimpsest collects Elling’s paintings from 2000 to 2010.

# Jadranka Kosorcic: Blind Date Edited by Jadranka Kosorcic. Text by Rebecca Geldard, William Pym, Raimar Stange.  

Croatian artist Jadranka Kosorcic’s drawings fall somewhere between the generic look of a wanted poster and the loving craft of an amateur portrait. Likening the experience to a blind date, Kosorcic (born 1972) finds her subjects through newspaper advertisements and chance meetings. Not quite likenesses of specific individuals, her works are immediate reproductions of the tension between artist and unknown sitter.

# Alejandra Icaza: Marshmallows  

Text by Jonathan Goodman, Paloma Martín Llopis, Javier González Durana.  

The abstract paintings of Spanish artist Alejandra Icaza (born 1966). Icaza’s abstract paintings appear like worlds hovering above canvas, in which objects and orbs of luminous color float in all directions and multiple perspectival planes meld and collide. Part retrospective and part artist’s book, this book presents a first assessment of his oeuvre.

Text by Christine Dorothea Hölzig. German artist Caroline Kober (born 1962) allows forms to emerge intuitively in her process of painting on paper, creating visual landscapes in beautifully modulating tones—pinks, blues and grays—that seduce the viewer into an imaginary sphere. She then introduces delicate line-drawn figures as quiet bearers of emotion to guide the viewer on the journey.

# Christoph Worringer Edited by Hermann Arnhold, Erich Franz. Text by Johannes Myssok, Raimund Stecker.  

German painter Christoph Worringer (born 1976) culls from the treasure trove of culture, art, history, religion, mythology and literature to create an unfathomable iconography of his own, condensing it into a world of images that is as realistic as it is unreal and disturbing. This publication is the first to trace Worringer’s artistic development through his paintings and drawings from 2003 to the present.

Opening up space for reflection, these works align the subjectivity of personal experience with that of painterly expression. Martin Schnur: Bipolar surveys the work of the Austrian artist made since 2002.

The paintings of Karin Kneffel (born 1957) are seductively illusionistic, reveling in the beauty of surface. Her resplendent interiors seem uncanny, her monumental still lifes surreal, her use of perspective ominously distorted, with reflections that develop a life of their own. With 70 color plates, this volume surveys her work to date.

# Norbert Tadeusz: Dark Companions Shadow Paintings 1965–2009 Text by Jochen Hörisch, Beat Wyss, Wolfgang Gmyrek, Hans Günter Golinski.  

Norbert Tadeusz (born 1940) remains one of the most important figurative painters in Germany. Dark Companions explores the role of the shadow in his oeuvre, focusing on three types: the harsh, graphic shadows of architectonic elements; the amorphous silhouettes of mythical beings; and the shadow of the artist himself, who appears in his paintings as both observer and creator.

# Norbert Schwontkowski: Angstroem  

Loosely narrative and frequently surreal, the paintings of Norbert Schwontkowski (born 1949) depict the world as simultaneously cartoonish and melancholic. His muted palette creates a subdued mood, while his carefully worked surfaces and minimal gestures convey an almost nightmarish intensity. This is the first publication in English to focus exclusively on his work.

# Rita McBride Edited by Dieter Schwarz.  

Since the 1980s, American sculptor Rita McBride (born 1960) has toyed with the relationship between functionalism and formalism in public structures. Relying on materials such as aluminum, brass and steel, she mines the sculptural possibilities of mass-produced goods. This publication features a series of works that reference the architectural plans of Le Corbusier, ironically reconceived as interior decorative objects.

Dutch artist Giny Vos (born 1959) has produced installations for public spaces from Apeldoorn to Delhi. Often consisting of thousands of lights or diodes, and using both language and image, Vos’ installations are addressed to each of their environments specifically. Singing in the Dark reveals the scope of Vos’ work and celebrates the magic of light in art.

# Rob Voerman: Aftermath Installations, Sculptures, Works on Paper Text by Sabine Folie, Tim Nolet, David van der Leer.  

Over the last decade, Dutch artist Rob Voerman (born 1966) has crafted architectural fictions, in which the romanticism of DIY culture opposes the political rhetoric of threat and fear. Working with basic materials such as cardboard, salvaged wood and found objects, Voerman draws on a variety of histories ranging from utopian hippy communities to remote terrorist hideouts to Art-Deco glasswork.

# Michal Budny Text by Jan Verwoert, Jakub Banasik, Lukasz Gorczyca.  

Using the simplest tools and materials (predominantly paper and cardboard), Polish artist Michal Budny (born 1976) creates formally restrained sculptures that range in size from tiny models to monumental installations and site-specific works. In addition to objects and places, Budny attempts to represent abstract phenomena that lack a fixed material form, such as voice, memory, rain and sunlight.

# Robert Schad: Through the Line Text by Roland Scotti, Bettina Ruhrberg, Gerlinde Brandenburg-Eisele, Clemens Ottnad.  

Using solid square-bar steel, German sculptor Robert Schad (born 1953) creates drawings of movement in space. Rather than bend or shape the material, Schad welds together straight limblike sections of varying lengths and strengths, imparting a paradoxical weightlessness to the works. Recalling human gestures such as sweeps and arches, these remarkable sculptures seem perpetually on the verge of dancing.

# Vincent Tavenne: Polarise-toi Text by Ralph Melcher, Kathrin ElversSvamberk, Myriam Herbel, Babette Richter.  

French sculptor Vincent Tavenne (born 1961) continually discovers new ways to experience space, through tents, pavilions, domes and spheres that he proposes as dwellings for imaginary nomads. Designed and stitched together by the selftaught architect, these structures immediately conjure a wealth of cultural associations ranging from Buckminster Fuller to Gordon Matta-Clark.

Swiss artist Kilian Rüthemann (born 1979) works with the spatial and architectural characteristics of an exhibition space, intervening minimally through the use of construction materials and interior décor such as fabrics, to lift or expose parts of the structure. This first comprehensive publication on the artist annotates his work from various perspectives.

# Cristina Iglesias  

Edited by Gloria Moure. Text by Patricia Falguières. Photographs by Gabriele Basilico. Simultaneously drawing on both Arte Povera and the Baroque, Spanish artist Cristina Iglesias (born 1956) belongs to a generation of sculptors who have pushed sculpture beyond the model of the discrete object, merging it with its architectural environment. Iglesias’ works mimic parts of buildings—roofs, walls, corners—and deploy bas-relief, tapestry and large-format silkscreen on silk and copper. This volume surveys her work to date.

# Ann Madden Text by Christina Kennedy, Helen O’Donoghue, John Montague.  

Ann Madden’s earliest experiments involved pouring paint on horizontal canvases. Pressing at her medium’s limits, Madden embarked on a large series of vertical works between 1970 and 1979, whose size was determined by her height and reach, and whose subject matter was inspired by megaliths. Spanning Madden’s career, this publication is comprised of works from the 1950s to the present.

# Al Taylor: Prints Edited by Michael Semff. Text by Debbie Taylor.  

The delicate Postminimalist sculptures and drawings of the American artist Al Taylor $(1948-1999)$ were for a long time better known in Europe than in the $\mathsf{U}.\mathsf{S}_{\cdot},$ despite Taylor’s residing in New York. This publication begins to remedy that oversight, providing a catalogue raisonné of Taylor’s graphic works. Aside from the published prints, it also reproduces all of the artist’s proofs and variants, which differ significantly from the final versions.

Birth of Romanticism presents works on paper by Canadian artist David Rabinowitch (born 1943). These incorporate a range of techniques such as charcoal, graphite, oil pastel and water-based paint as well as collages with sandpaper and vellum.

Towards the end of the 1960s, against the backdrops of Minimalism, Conceptualism and Color Field painting, British artist Alan Uglow (born 1941) began emptying out the pictorial surfaces of his paintings. Stripped to the bare bones, his bestknown works are blank canvases outlined in monochromatic bands, works that occupy the space between picture, relief and architectural entity.

The book combines documentary details of Thompson’s paintings with outtakes from Ethridge’s commercial magazine work, along with selected notebook sketches, collages, fabric samples and color charts. The juxtapositions, which at first appear haphazard, coalesce into a complex rumination on the creative process.

Devoid of figuration or metaphoric allusions, the artist’s “Farbraumkörper” or “color-space-bodies” evolve entirely out of evanescent color effects, somewhat in the vein of Rothko. Working on highly absorbent ground, Graubner maximizes the murkier tendencies of his pigments.

# Antoni Clavé: A World of Art Works 1934–2002  

Edited by José Francisco Yvars. Text by Pierre Daix, Alain Mousseigne, Álvaro Martínez Novillo, Albert Mercadé, Josep Casamartine. The work of painter, printmaker, sculptor and stage designer Antoni Clavé (1913–2005) evolved from an intimiste style influenced by Bonnard and Vuillard to a pure, minimal look, in later years becoming entirely abstract. This monograph is the first complete survey since his death.

# Gérard Gasiorowski: Starting the Painting Again  

Text by Éric Mangion, Frédéric Bonnet, Eric Mangion, Laurent Manoeuvre, Erik Verhagen.  

The intriguing career of French painter Gérard Gasiorowski (1930–1986) led his admirers through several changes of style, from his early hyperrealism to later abstraction. This publication features all of the important series of his works, from the Approche series (1964–1970) to Fertilité (1986) and an interview made several months before Gasiorowski’s death.

# Blaise Drummond Edited by Martin Henschei. Text by Claudia Banz, Claire Le Restif.  

Blaise Drummond (born 1967) examines the relationship between nature and culture through extreme juxtapositions of architecture and landscape. Reminiscent of Le Corbusier’s Pavillon de l´Esprit Nouveau, this catalogue focuses on a recent museum installation, in which a dead tree seems to be growing through the ceiling. This subjugation of the natural world is further explored in Drummond’s paintings and drawings.

# Ali Banisadr Edited by Alessandra Bellavita. Text by Fereshteh Daftari. Translation by Jeanne Bouniort.  

The fantastical landscapes of Iranian-born painter Ali Banisadr (born 1976) are informed by his experiences as a war refugee. Fusing his own recollections with Persian mythology, the artist creates anarchical scenes of carnage amplified by rich colorful abstraction. Banisadr’s lush compositions suggest Hieronymus Bosch, while his fractured imagery evokes the shock of trauma.

# Stefan à Wengen: The Mission Text by Christoph Lichtin, Beate Ermacora, Julian Heynen, Stefan à Wengen.  

Since the mid-1990s, Swiss painter Stefan à Wengen (born 1964) has made paintings that take the Freudian idea of the uncanny as the basis for his pictorial explorations. Film and reportage photography act as formal cladding, producing atmospherically charged paintings that suggest shadowed and obscure worlds. This is the first monograph on the artist.

# The Painted Photographs of Melvin Charney  

Between Observation and Intervention Edited by Gwendolyn Owens, Gabriela Rangel. Text by Gwendolyn Owens, Saul Ostrow. Interview with Yasmeen Siddiqui.  

Since 1989, Canadian artist Melvin Charney has created painted photographs—stylized portrayals of buildings executed in pastel or thin washes of paint and superimposed on printed mass media images—that expose the triumphs, tragedies and absurdities of the modern city.

# Marc Lüders: Invention of Reality  

Edited by Alexander Sarailly. Text by Luminita Sabau, Stephan Berg.  

Combining painting and photography, German artist Marc Lüders (born 1963) creates complex scenes that challenge viewers’ expectations of reality and illusion. Through a painstaking process, the artist transposes painted figures and objects onto photographs of existing landscapes— interventions that are often imperceptible at first glance. This survey publication features the artist’s latest series devoted to American supermarkets.

Since 1992, German artist Jürgen Durner (born 1964) has created fantastically disorienting paintings on mirrored panes of glass. Depicting a mélange of architectural elements, these works, with their layered superimpositions, simulate the effect of looking into a window at night. Cast in the sickly glow of neon lights, Durner’s works induce thought-provoking distortions of urban life.

# Eckart Hahn: Grand Ouvert Text by Iris Possegger.  

Who would expect to find latex gloves flying like birds or a Christmas tree dripping with white glue? In his paintings, German artist Eckart Hahn (born 1971) places everyday objects into entirely unfamiliar contexts in order to create surreal connections. The deliberately leftfield logic of his scenes contradicts the artist’s exacting photographic representation of them.

German painter Alex Tennigkeit (born 1976) investigates the codes of hip-hop culture through visual and textual citations from film, music, fashion and advertising, to capitalize on the most superficial elements of the media world—naked bodies, blinging jewelry and fast cars. These images assume an apocalyptic tone when paired with elements like skulls, bones and fire.

German artist Bettina van Haaren (born 1961) explores the idea of pictorial coherence as an accumulative and discrete entity, through intentionally disjointed paintings and drawings. She depicts architectural fragments and partial figures whose bodies are engaged in acts of resistance and response. Mirroring this push and pull, she invites the viewer to complete the image.

# Facing Pistoletto Edited by Andrea Bellini.  

Facing Pistoletto gathers together, for the first time, extensive documentation on Michelangelo Pistoletto’s theater and performative works of the 1960s and 1970s. A fundamental but overlooked aspect of Pistoletto’s work is its emphasis on collaboration and participation, exemplified by the Zoo group. Here, the artist tells the history of Zoo with great passion in an exciting discussion with Andrea Bellini.

# Jürgen Klauke: Aesthetic Paranoia  

Edited by Peter Weibel. Text by Régis Dura Ursula Frohne, Andreas Beitin.  

Since the 1970s, photo and media artist Jürgen Klauke (born 1943) has consistently undermined standardized gender identities and behavior patterns through the use of his own body in his work. His most recent series describes the paranoid condition of today’s world, translating it into an “Aesthetic Paranoia” that ranges from the minimalist to the excessive and occasionally surreal.

# Allen Jones: Showtime Text by Belinda Grace Gardner.  

Jazz clubs, cocktail bars, circuses and magic shows pervade the erotically charged paintings of British Pop artist Allen Jones (born 1937). Jones developed an aesthetic centered on the eroticism of glossy magazines, advertisements and cartoons. These latest paintings continue Jones’ pursuit of eroticism, and feature images of entwined dancers and lovers, surging with palpable energy and seductive color, caught up in the dance of eros that is Jones’ Nietzschean vision of human vitality.

# Sandra Vásquez de la Horra Text by Jonas Storsve, Alexander van Grevenstein.  

The intimately melancholic drawings of Chileanborn, Düsseldorf-based artist Sandra Vásquez de la Horra (born 1967) are saturated in the atmospheric fragility of fugitive ephemera. They are also saturated in a more literal sense, in a melted beeswax that, when hardened, embalms them in a yellow-brown laminate that further heightens their artifact feel. This is the first monograph on her work.

In recent years, the artist has focused his attention on the western art historical canon, epitomized by his comical computer simulation “The Last Judgment in Cyberspace,” in which Miao replaces the figures of Michelangelo’s iconic fresco with his own image.

# Zeng Fanzhi Preface by Fabien Fryns. Text by Richard Shiff.  

The work of Chinese painter Zeng Fanzhi (born 1964) reveals a great deal about his homeland’s rapidly changing society. In his Mask paintings, people wearing plain white masks confront the viewer with wide eyes and grotesquely exaggerated hands. In addition to these well-known images, this publication features works from all of his series, including the early Meat and Hospital cycles.

# Federico Solmi Texts by Renato Miracco, Bianca De La Torre.  

This is the first monograph on Italian artist Federico Solmi (born 1973). Using images culled from the video-game industry, pop culture and the internet, Solmi creates irreverent, bawdy satires about the vices of contemporary society. These outrageous critiques, of a jubilant yet crumbling present, earned the artist a prestigious Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in 2009.

# Yang Qian  

Yang Qian (born 1959) creates photorealistic paintings that elicit unexpected sensualities from the banalities of contemporary life. He frequently borrows tropes from Western art history, such as the classic theme of Venus at her toilette, and updates them for a contemporary viewer with modern settings, voyeuristic detail and his ravishing treatment of surface.

# Design for a Living World  

Text by Abbott Miller, Ellen Lupton, Andy Grundberg.  

Design for a Living World was developed by The Nature Conservancy, one of the world’s leading conservation organizations, in order to raise global awareness about the impact and promise of sustainable sourcing. Ten prominent designers, including Kate Spade, Issac Mizrahi, Yves Béhar, Hella Jongerius and Ted Muehling were invited to create objects using only sustainably grown and harvested materials from some of the world’s most beautiful and ecologically precarious places. Each of these landscapes supports its own distinct ecosystem and provides crucial livelihoods to local communities; each one is threatened by the effects of climate change and global economics—deforestation, overdevelopment and other destructive forces. Design for a Living World illuminates the complexity and vitality of raw materials at their source, including the people and cultures that actually produce them. The above designers were selected for their willingness to experiment and for their record of active engagement with issues of sustainability and social justice. In addition to presenting the designers’ sketches, models and finished objects, Design for a Living World features original photographs by award-winning photojournalist Ami Vitale, who traveled around the world to document the many landscapes explored in this volume.

# Rococo  

The Continuing Curve, 1730–2008 Text by Sarah D. Coffin, Gail S. Davidson, Ellen Lupton, Penelope Hunter-Stiebel.  

The movement known as Rococo began in eighteenth-century France, and has infused design objects with a sinuous, organic, and sensuous impulse for three centuries. Rococo dominated French design from 1730 to $^{1765,}$ during the reign of Louis XV. Rococo ideas, transmitted by prints, objects and the traveling designers themselves, quickly spread to England, the Netherlands, the German states, Italy and America. Rococo resurfaced in England under the flamboyant George IV and in France during the Second Empire. Its most significant revival occurred in the design concept known as Art Nouveau. In the twenty-first century, the Rococo spirit has burst forth once again as a creative force. Rococo:The Continuing Curve, 1730–2008, featuring essays by international scholars and over 380 color illustrations, traces the movement within the historic continuum.

Justly renowned as one of the finest printmakers of the eighteenth century, Giovanni Battista Piranesi $(1720-1778)$ is best known for his etched views of Rome and its antiquities, as well as for his highly influential suite of drawings entitled Carceri, or Imaginary Prisons. Trained as an architect, Piranesi revolutionized architecture and design through his combination of decorative elements and ornamental motifs from the Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek and Roman styles; yet his work as the designer of interiors and furnishings has been largely uncelebrated until now. Published in conjunction with a major exhibition at the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in 2007, Piranesi as Designer features ten accessible essays and more than 300 rare illustrations that explore the far-reaching impact of Piranesi’s style on three centuries of architecture and design.

# House Proud Nineteenth-Century Watercolor Interiors from the Thaw Collection Text by Gail S. Davidson, Floramae McCarron-Cates, Charlotte Gere.  

In the nineteenth century, it became fashionable for aristocratic and upper-class homeowners in Europe to commission watercolor paintings of their domestic interiors and to collect them in albums. House Proud: Nineteenth-century Watercolor Interiors from the Thaw Collection commemorates the recent gift of $85$ nineteenth-century watercolor interior drawings— the largest collection of its kind in America—to Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum by Eugene V. and Clare E. Thaw. Essays analyzing these beautiful, exquisitely detailed watercolors and their significance to the Museum’s collection, accompanied by the watercolors and related objects from the permanent collection, document the evolution of the domestic interior in the nineteenth century, revealing the impact of economic, social, and political developments on the concept of the home.

# Fashioning Felt Text by Susan Brown, Matilda McQuaid, Andrew Dent, Christine Martens.  

Felt is the oldest fabric known to mankind; its earliest examples date back to 6,500 B.C. In recent years, the fabric has found contemporary applications in an extraordinary range of fields, including product design, fashion, architecture and home furnishings. Felt’s first revival in modern times occurred as a part of the fiberarts movement of the 1970s; the 1990s saw a surge of innovations in its production, triggering the current resurgence of interest in the fabric. A combination of scholarly research into its history, the exploration of its technical applications and sustainability issues have inspired many leading artists and designers to work with felt. Fashioning Felt examines this recent explosion of interest. Published in conjunction with a major exhibition at the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, it presents handmade and commercially produced designs for felt, and explores through essays and full-color illustrations the material’s rich history.
