21.2 Any effort by a tenderer to influence the Employer in the process of examination, evaluation and comparison of tenders and decisions concerning award of Contract may result in the rejection of the tenderer’s tender.  

# 22 Clarification of Tenders  

22.1 To assist in the examination, evaluation and comparison of tenders, the Employer may ask tenderers individually for clarification of their tenders, including breakdown of unit prices.  The request for clarification and the response shall be in writing or by cable, facsimile or telex, but no change in the price or substance of the tender shall be sought, offered or permitted except as required to confirm the correction of arithmetical errors discovered by the employer during the evaluation of the tenders in accordance with clause 24.

# 23 Determination of Responsiveness  

23.1 Prior to the detailed evaluation of tenders, the Employer will determine whether each tender is substantially responsive to the requirements of the tender documents.  

23.2 For the purpose of this clause, a substantially responsive tender is one which conforms to all the terms, conditions and specifications of the tender documents without material deviation or reservation and has a valid bank guarantee.  A material deviation or reservation is one which affects in any substantial way the scope, quality, completion timing or administration of the Works to be undertaken by the tenderer under the Contract, or which limits in any substantial way, inconsistent with the tender documents, the Employer’s rights or the tenderers obligations under the Contract and the rectification of which would affect unfairly the competitive position of other tenderers who have presented substantially responsive tenders.  

23.3 Each price or unit rate inserted in the Bills of Quantities shall be a realistic estimate of the cost of completing the works described under the particular item including allowance for overheads, profits and the like.  Should a tender be seriously unbalanced in relation to the Employer’s estimate of the works to be performed under any item or groups of items, the tender shall be deemed not responsive.  

23.4 A tender determined to be not substantially responsive will be rejected by the Employer and may not subsequently be made responsive by the tenderer by correction of the non-conforming deviation or reservation.  

# 24 Correction of Errors  

enders determined to be substantially responsive shall be checked by the Employer for any arithmetic errors in the omputations and summations.  Errors will be corrected by the Employer as follows:  

(a) Where there is a discrepancy between the amount in figures and the amount in words, the amount in words will govern.   
(b) Where there is a discrepancy between the unit rate and the line item total resulting from multiplying the unit rate by the quantity, the unit rate as quoted will prevail, unless in the opinion of the Employer, there is an obvious typographical error, in which case adjustment will be made to the entry containing that error.   
(c) The amount stated in the tender will be adjusted in accordance with the above procedure for the correction of errors and, with concurrence of the tenderer, shall be considered as binding upon the tenderer.  If the tenderer does not accept the corrected amount, the tender may be rejected and the Tender Security may be forfeited in accordance with clause 13.  

# 25 Conversion to Single Currency  

25.1 For compensation of tenders, the tender price shall first be broken down into the respective amounts payable in various currencies by using the selling rate or rates of the Central Bank of Kenya ruling on the date twenty-eight (28) days before the final date for the submission of tenders.  

25.2 The Employer will convert the amounts in various currencies in which the tender is payable (excluding provisional sums but including Day works where priced competitively) to Kenya Shillings at the selling rates stated in clause 25.1.  

# 26 Evaluation and Comparison of Tenders  

26.1 The Employer will evaluate only tenders determined to be substantially responsive to the requirements of the tender documents in accordance with clause 23.  

26.2 In evaluating tenders, the Employer will determine for each tender the evaluated tender price by adjusting the tender price as follows:  

(a) Making any correction for errors pursuant to clause 24.   
(b) Excluding Provisional Sums and provision, if any, for Contingencies in the Bills of Quantities, but including Day works where priced competitively.  

26.3 The Employer reserves the right to accept any variation, deviation or alternative offer.  Variations, deviations, alternative offers and other factors which are in excess of the requirements of the tender documents or otherwise result in the accrual of unsolicited benefits to the Employer, shall not be taken into account in tender evaluation.  

26.4 Price adjustment provisions in the Conditions of Contract applied over the period of execution of the Contract shall not be taken into account in tender evaluation.  

26.5 If the lowest evaluated tender is seriously unbalanced or front loaded in relation to the Employer’s estimate of the items of work to be performed under the Contract, the Employer may require the tenderer to produce detailed price analyses for any or all items of the Bills of Quantities, to demonstrate the relationship between those prices, proposed construction methods and schedules.  After evaluation of the price analyses, the Employer may require that the amount of the Performance Security set forth in clause 29 be increased at the expense of the successful tenderer to a level sufficient to protect the Employer against financial loss in the event of subsequent default of the successful tenderer under the Contract.  

26.6 Firms incorporated in Kenya where indigenous Kenyans own $51\%$ or more of the share capital shall be allowed a $10\%$ preferential bias provided that they do not sub-contract work valued at more than $50\%$ of the Contract Price excluding Provisional Sums to a non-indigenous sub-contractor.  

# AWARD OF CONTRACT  

# 27 Award

27.2 The Employer reserves the right to accept or reject any tender, and to annual the tendering process and reject all tenders, at any time prior to award of Contract, without thereby incurring any liability to the affected tenderers or any obligation to inform the affected tenderers of the grounds for the Employer’s action.
