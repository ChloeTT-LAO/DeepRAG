However, it has gradually forayed into a diversity of habitats, breaking the environmental, as well as geographical barriers, and encompassing agroecosystems that reflect a wide range of water and temperature regimes, altitude level, and edaphic properties. Its cultivation extends to latitudes that circumscribe the tropical and semi temperate environments, ranging from $40^{\\circ}$ south in central Argentina to $51^{\\circ}$ north in north-eastern China. Thus, rice is grown in more diverse environmental conditions than any other major crop.

        "text": "The establishment of a series of IARCs under the aegis of the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR) was a quintessential response to the emerging food crisis in the early sixties of the last century in the developing world. The first among those was the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), originally funded by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and established in the Philippines in 1960. IRRI in its first decade primarily focused on research and related activities at its center, which resulted among other things in the development of a high-yielding semidwarf variety, IR8 (IRRI’s flagship); establishment of a gene bank; development of screening techniques for resistance to major diseases and insects; establishment of a comprehensive training program, setting up of a library with world’s largest collection of rice literature, and so on. To buttress the varietal improvement research, a multidisciplinary ‘Genetic Evaluation, and Utilization (GEU)’ program was introduced in IRRI’s second decade. Once equipped with the necessary research wherewithal, and having acquired the capacity to take a lead role, IRRI initiated the establishment of various research networks with the cooperation and commitment of the NARES. The International Rice Testing Program (IRTP), which was subsequently renamed as International Network for Genetic Evaluation of Rice (INGER) was the first among those networks. Initiation of the networks also reflects on the concern and realization of IRRI, that while it has a global mandate for rice improvement, its research facilities are located in but one of the several rice growing environments. For example, gall midge, a major insect pest in parts of South Asia does not occur in the Philippines, which limits IRRI’s capabilities to carry research related to that pest without collaboration with scientists in the concerned national programs. Similar is the case with problems such as deepwater, low temperature, acid sulphate soils, etc. Thus, networking involving NARES has become imperative for global rice improvement. ",

In course of ten years after the start, the proportion of sources of entries has significantly changed, with over $65\\%$ originating from NARES and $35\\%$ from IARCs, primarily from IRRI. That reflects on the strength gained by the national breeding programs, as resulting from the active participation of its scientists in INGER, and in the network-sponsored joint site visits, workshops, and training programs, with an opportunity to interact with fellow rice scientists from other countries. Thus, with the strengthening of capabilities and institution building, the breeding researches of the NARES progressed from dependency to interdependency.

Some entries have been successfully utilized as restorers in hybrid rice programs. For example, 36 hybrids released in India and 34 in China, owe their restorer source to INGER. The multilocation screening trials have provided valuable information on pathogenic variation in major disease-causing organisms, and biotype variation in severe crop-damaging insect pests.

INGERtested and released varieties caused a significant part of that increase, as indicated by the number of varieties released through that mechanism. Two Yale University economists, Robert Evenson and Douglas Gollin studied 591 INGER-derived high-yielding and pest-resistant varieties released in 64 countries. They estimated that each released variety contributes annually USD 2.5 million to the global economy at 1990’s costs.

However, significant genetic variation exists in respect of important postharvest traits, such as seed vigour and threshability. Thus, entries in observation and yield trials must be characterized for those traits and their values included in the data collection, as they have a recognizable influence on the ultimate yield. The yield figures as recorded now are not reflective of the realizable yields after postharvest operations, which may obliterate the varietal rankings. ",

It uses up to two to three times more water than other food crops such as maize or wheat and consumes around $30\\%$ of the freshwater used for crops worldwide. Thus, there is an urgent need to regulate the water footprints contributed by rice culture. While scientists from relevant disciplines have been pursuing research toward this goal, INGER should do its part by capitalizing on its cooperative base to evaluate varieties at selected representative sites for their performance under a range of hydrological situations. Carefully planned testing should enable identifying varieties with good performance under an optimal input of irrigation water. On the other hand, efforts should be intensified to screen for tolerance to water stress. Also, systematic monitoring should be done to elucidate the utilization of several INGER entries identified in the past for drought tolerance, and promising progenies from those breeding efforts have to be evaluated by the INGER system.

Through painstaking and sustained efforts, substantial number of traditional varieties and landraces, possessing a repertoire of treasured genes have been fingerprinted and characterized at IRRI for morphological and physiological traits, and reactions to major diseases and insect pests. However, it may be noted that the data gathered pertains to the environment of IRRI’s home base. The gene bank is meant for the benefit of the entire rice-growing world. INGER screening trials have brought out the differential reactions of varieties to major stresses in different environments. Thus, the data collected at IRRI may not have relevance to other countries. The gene bank’s varietal characterization chart should reflect the differential reactions where they exist, for it to serve its global mandate. Therefore, it is essential to initiate a special screening nursery for the traditional germplasm for testing at selected hotspots identified by INGER. Since it involves a large-scale planning for screening in batches of the voluminous collection and analysing the data systematically, external funding is very essential to avoid financial burden on the cooperating centers.

Valuable bonuses from such an approach are savings in time and monetary inputs, and more importantly, acceleration of the transfer of technology to the farmer. The pooling of materials from diverse sources also promotes the much-needed genetic diversity. While the agroecological diversity of rice crop poses a ‘challenge’ for varietal improvement, geographical diversity provides an ‘opportunity’ for cooperation. The rice genetic improvement network has been founded on this sanguine concept. Individual strengths of the national systems may vary, but their collective strength is formidable. A meaningful fusion of those complementary strengths has powered INGER to effectively serve the needs of the various participating countries in fostering location-specific genetic enhancement of rice. INGER thus has proved to be an epitome of veritable synergy and signifies the power of cooperation. The incontrovertible benefits such as efficacy in the use of resources, reduced costs, and saving on time, render the network concept continue to permeate various aspects of agricultural research for the betterment of the farmers and consumers. In this context, the funding agencies need to take cognizance of the fact that their financial support to cooperative networks such as INGER would yield very significant returns in terms of the world’s food security, paying the value of their investments.

We had an overlap of one year before he proceeded to the USA for higher studies. Since then, our professional, as well as, social interactions gathered mileage and flourished all through his life. At CRRI (present National Rice Research Institute (NRRI), Cuttack), both of us were in the Japonica x indica Hybridization Scheme. The variety, Masoori was one of the wellknown products of that program. After returning from the USA, Dr. Shastry joined IARI, where he pursued research on rice cytology. At the same time, I was involved in research on Cytogenetics of interspecific hybrids in Oryza. We had a good collection of wild relatives of rice, as well as, wild species of Oryza at CRRI, which formed the experimental material for my research. With the techniques then available, rice was relatively less amenable for distinct cytomorphological characterization of full-length pachytene chromosomes. Our parallel efforts, however, provided an opportunity for closer interactions through the exchange of ideas, visits, and materials, leading to useful results in an area of rice research that remained unchartered until that time. After CRRI, our professional paths crossed again, when we were brought together at AICRIP in 1966, where he directed the Project, and I was heading the breeding program. We spent ten years together with commitment to that ICAR’s flagship coordinated research endeavour. The AICRIP chapter in my research career was most memorable because that coincided with the launch of the Green Revolution. ",

With no physical facilities and limited fiscal support, we initiated the coordination program. Dr. Shastry, Dr. Freeman, and I were sharing a single room in the Sorghum Center (PIRRCOM). The seed of important breeding lines was also stored in the same room. The paucity of facilities did not come in the way of our research efforts, having been engulfed by the excitement and determination driven by the promise of new technology. An excellent team spirit forged by Dr. Shastry galvanized our efforts. Here I must make a mention of the deep commitment and valuable inputs of Dr. Freeman to the program, which acted complementary to the able leadership provided by Dr. Shastry. When the first batch of HYV’s resulting from our breeding efforts (Jaya, Sona, Rasi, etc.) made a mark in All-India testing, ICAR provided funds for physical facilities and research staff. Dr. Shastry, Dr. Freeman, and I, in our internal dialogues often used to refer to AICRIP as ‘66 spirit’. The Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission during his visit to AICRIP in early 1976, stated in the guest book, ‘few staff members, yet very significant output’. That was a great tribute to the program driven by team spirit. ",

After spending two years at FAO, Dr. Shastry joined IITA in Nigeria, as Director of Research, where he actively pursued the Rice research program. As Global Coordinator of INGER, I had a regional unit for West Africa, headquartered at IITA. Thus our professional interactions continued as staff members of different CGIAR centers, but with common involvement in rice. After his retirement, I had the privilege of having Dr. Shastry as a consultant for INGER on two or three occasions. Even after both of us retired, we had been periodically communicating with each other relative to various aspects of rice research. The keen interest he had evinced in rice in our most recent interactions just a few months before he passed away, was no less intense than those we used to have when we were actively working together at AICRIP.

Consequently, there has been increased focus of research on their biology, genetics and molecular biology in search of alternative methods to manage them.  This review highlights main findings of these studies to reveal how genetic plasticity of the brown planthopper (BPH) has equipped the species to fight back adversities and pose challenges for its effective management. Genome of BPH with size of $1141~\\mathrm{Mb}$ spread across 30 chromosomes is predicted to have 27,571 genes. Salivary glands, first line of offense, secrete proteins that trigger either susceptibility (ETS) or immunity (ETI) reaction in the host plant. Fat bodies, spread all over the body, are sites of primary lipid metabolism, endocrine regulation, systemic immunity, vitellogenesis, and housing of microbial symbionts. BPH harbours yeast like symbionts (YLS) in its fat bodies that play critical role in insect survival. BPH populations across Asia have acquired resistance against almost all classes of insecticides which has been attributed to neofunctionalization of duplicated P450 genes. So far about 40 major host plant resistance genes and 72 QTLs have been reported from cultivated rice and its wild relatives but BPH has ability to quickly evolve virulent populations. Role of cytochrome P450 enzymes and of symbiotic YLS in this ability has been shown.  Several studies have focused on the reproductive physiology of BPH and identified key genes that can be target for RNAi mediated silencing as novel strategy for pest management. Several recent studies have also covered genetic and molecular basis of wing polymorphism and adaptation for long distance migration in this insect. Other recent studies on effect of climate change on BPH incidence and its genetic ability to adapt to the changes in the weather and climate have cautioned that this insect is likely to continue to be a major problem in days to come. On a larger perspective, this rapidly expanding knowledge is providing us with novel approaches and tools to contain the pest and stay a step ahead of it in the evolutionary race. ",

Despite 46 species of planthoppers being reported to feed on rice, these three species, especially BPH, have challenged rice production in intensive rice cultivation belt across Asia.  It especially causes direct damage in all stages of life cycle, particularly nymph and adult stages, by direct feeding on phloem sap and by transmitting ragged stunt virus and grassy stunt virus diseases. Prior to 1980s BPH was not even reckoned as a pest of rice.  This phenomenal evolutionary success, as it is now emerging through intensive studies, is attributed to its genetic plasticity and adaptability. Due to its high economic impact on rice production, a large number of researcher groups across the world have been engaged in intensive studies during the past five decades.  This has resulted in explosion of over 770 research publications during last five decades (Figure 1).  The major focus of these studies has been on insecticide resistance related $(30\\%)$ , insect-plant interactions $(22\\%)$ and reproduction $(19\\%)$ .

These produce two types of secretions: a coagulating gelling secretion that quickly hardens to form salivary sheath around the probing stylets consisting of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes, and a watery secretion that contains digestive enzymes like alkaline phosphatase, esterase, amylase, beta glucosidase as well as other components mainly secretary salivary gland proteins (SSGPs).  These SSGPs are main class of effectors that trigger susceptibility (ETS) or immunity (ETI) depending on the rice genotype BPH is attempting to feed upon (Huang et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2017). Of the 352 reported genes encoding putative secreted proteins of salivary gland, 67 genes are differentially expressed in TN1 and Mudgo reared insects (Ji et al., 2013). Rao et al., (2019) characterized six of the effector proteins. A mucin-like protein is required for feeding by BPH but it also induces immunity response in plants acting like an effector (Shangguan et al., 2018).Application of salivary gland extract to rice plants induces systemic host mRNA patterns associated with nutrient remobilization (Petrova and Smith, 2015). Thus, salivary gland of BPH has a repertoire of effector proteins which can evolve rapidly to overcome host mediated resistance. ",

        "text": "Insect fat body is a highly dynamic tissue composed primarily of storage cells. It is distributed throughout the  insect’s  internal  body  cavity; the haemocoel, near the epidermis, digestive organs and ovaries. Akin to the combination of liver and adipose tissue in mammals, fat bodies are site of primary lipid metabolism, endocrine regulation, systemic immunity, vitellogenesis, and housing of microbial symbionts. BPH harbours yeast like symbionts (YLS) in its fat bodies that play critical role in insect survival. While the insect can degrade seven of the amino acids independently, six of these are catabolised exclusively byYLS while seven more of these are degraded by both (Wan et al., 2015).  Impaired lysine degradation by YLS negatively affects the survival and development of $N.$ . lugens. Transcriptome analysis of fat bodies from two BPH populations with different virulence levels revealed that these are sites of intermediate metabolism, immunity and detoxification of xenobiotics (Yu et al., 2014).  Expression of several of the genes in BPH population reared on Mudgo rice differed significantly from those reared on TN1 rice. Lipid, amino acid and xenobiotic metabolism related genes were significantly upregulated in the Mudgo population.  Protein transport related genes in YLS, and cell division and ribosome assembly related genes in another symbiont Wolbachia were upregulated in this population.  These studies highlight the critical role of the symbionts in BPH virulence on resistant genotypes. ",

        "text": "BPH populations across Asia have acquired resistance against almost all classes of insecticides (Matsumura et al., 2009; Garrood et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018). There have been intensive studies on evolution and mechanism of insecticide resistance.  Role of P450 genes, a family with 54 genes, in insecticide resistance in BPH has been extensively documented. Neofunctionalization of duplicated P450 genes drives the evolution of insecticide resistance in the insect (Zimmer et al., 2018). Garrood et al., (2015) studied field-evolved resistance to imidacloprid and ethiprole in populations of BPH collected from across South and East Asia.  Association of overexpression of CYP6ER1 gene with resistance to imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and buprofezin was noted. RNA interference of this CYP6ER1 gene resulted in susceptibility (Garrood et al., 2015; Pang et al., 2016).  However, P450 CYP6AY1 was over expressed in one of the Indian populations.  Synergistic and compensatory effects of two- point mutations in the insect GABA receptor RDL confer resistance to fipronil (Zhang et al., 2015). Carboxyl esterase gene (NlCarE) plays an important role in chlorpyrifos detoxification and its overexpression may be involved in chlorpyrifos resistance in N.  lugens (Lu et al.,, 2017). RNA interference of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) increases susceptibility to insecticides including buprofezin (Liu et al., 2015). ",

        "text": "Major emphasis of BPH management is on development of resistant rice varieties exploiting host plant resistance (Brar et al., 2009). So far about 40 major genes and 72 QTLs conferring resistance to BPH have been reported from cultivated rice and its wild relatives (Fujita et al., 2013, Ling and Weillin 2016, Du et al., 2020, Haliru et al., 2020). A major limitation here is the ability of BPH to quickly evolve virulent populations, often referred to as biotypes, capable of overcoming host resistance.  Recent studies have been aiming to understand genetic and molecular basis of such virulence in BPH.  Role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in virulence was studied by Peng et al., (2017) who noted that among the 21 Cyp genes CYP4C61 gene expressions was more in virulent biotype Y than in biotype 1. They suggest that duplication of P450 genes in BPH genome is likely contributing to adaptation to host plant resistance, as in case of insecticide resistance noted above. Role of symbiotic YLS in metabolic response of BPH while feeding on resistant rice has been studied (Liu et al., 2017). The study showed significant metabolic differences between BPH nymphs feeding on the resistant NIL-BPH15 and susceptible TN1 rice. To survive on this resistant rice, BPH nymphs probably ingest more sap and/or get necessary nutrients from their yeast-like symbionts at later feeding stages. Jing et al., (2014) and Kobayashi et al., (2014) have attempted to map virulence loci that break down host resistance on BPH genome using molecular markers. Over 860 markers including 125 gene specific markers have been reported and used in mapping three virulence loci Qhp7, Qgr5 & Qgr14 (Jing et al., 2014). Kobayashi et al., (2014) mapped the virulence gene vBph1 located in the $1.8~\\mathrm{cM}$ genomic region flanked by SNPmarkers VLS01 and VLS05 of linkage group 10. ",

Role of BroadComplex (Br) and Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), two transcription factor gens down stream of juvenile hormone and ecdysone pathways in the ovary development was noted by Jiang et al., (2017). An adenylyl cyclase like-9 gene (NlAC9) influences growth and fecundity in BPH (Ge et al., 2017a). PHF7, a novel male gene influences female fecundity and population growth through secretion of accessory gland and transferred to female through mating (Ge et al., 2017b). This can be a target gene for RNAi mediated gene silencing to reduce population growth of the insect.  Ge et al., (2016) have also shown that suppressing male spermatogenesis-associated protein 5-like gene expression reduces vitellogenin gene expression and fecundity.  Yu et al., (2016) identified 94 seminal fluid proteins in the male accessory glands of BPH of which four were unique to this insect. Forkhead box transcription factor L2 activated follicle cell protein gene NlFcp3C to regulate insect chorion formation (Ye et al., 2017). Role of juvenile hormone (JH) secreted by corpora allata has been studied intensively. TOR pathway-mediated JH synthesis regulates nutrient-dependent female reproduction (Lu et al., 2016), while nutritional signaling also regulates vitellogenin synthesis and egg development through JH (Liu et al., 2016). Silencing a sugar transporter gene Nlst6 reduces growth and fecundity. Several agro-chemicals like antibiotics or even insecticides stimulate BPH reproduction.  Adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) mediates the antibiotic jinggangmycinstimulated reproduction (Jiang et al., 2015). Sublethal doses of triazophos and fenvelrate insecticides also induce reproduction (Bao et al., 2008). ",

To suit to this adaptation, the insect has wing dimorphism involving short winged brachyperous forms with high fecundity and long winged macropterous form suited to long distance migration. Several recent studies have covered genetic and molecular basis of wing polymorphism and adaptation for long distance migration.  There is an ovarian diapause in macropterous females prior to migration and TOR (target of rapamycin) genes are shown to be involved in this diapause (Liu et al., 2016). Zhou et al., (2017) showed that transformer-2 (NlTra-2) determines sex in nymph and wing shape of the progeny. They also suggested the important role of NlJHEH (juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase) gene in determining the wing morph.  Higher levels of JH in V instar nymph lead to development of short wings. Xu and Zhang (2017) explained the molecular basis by which two insulin receptors (InR1 and InR2) act as switches to determine alternative wing morphs in the BPH. ",

They observed that increased $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and temperature resulted in escalated BPH multiplication through increase in both fecundity and number of adults, thus inflicting higher yield loss in rice.  Similar study in Bangladesh by Ali et al., (2014) showed months or areas characterized by a climate that is either cold and dry or hot and wet that are likely to experience higher levels of BPH due to climate change. At high temperature $(37~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$ , heat shock protein (HSP) genes were the most co-regulated (Huang et al., 2017). Macropterous are more heat resistant than brachypterous adults.

In this study 177 RILs derived from a cross of Swarna / 166s (Swarna /Oryza nivara), were characterized for yield and grain shape related traits for two seasons Rabi 2018-19 and Kharif 2019. Phenotypic correlation analysis showed that, single plant yield had a positive association with productive tiller number, total tiller number, panicle weight, biomass and harvest index in both the seasons. Significant and positive correlation was observed between grain length and grain perimeter followed by productive tiller number and total tiller number. A perfect negative linear relationship was observed between filled grain percentage and unfilled grain percentage. Across the seasons, biomass weight consistently showed significant positive correlations with the majority of yield contributing traits, followed by days to 50 percent flowering. Grain shape traits (grain length, grain width, length/width ratio, grain area and grain perimeter) were interrelated with each other significantly. Trait association study in this mapping population showed that though the yield performance has always been the main focus of breeding programmes, the complex interaction of the yield attributes is also equally significant to understand the genetic mechanisms for yield improvement. Selected RILs from this study are being used in rice improvement programmes to detect favorable genes from $O$ . nivara for yield improvement. ",

        "text": "Rice (Oryza sativa L) is one of the most important staple food crops of the world providing nutritional and economic benefits to more than half of the world population (Roy and Shil, 2020). Rice yield needs to be continuously improved to fulfill the future demands of increasing population and to enhance living standards. However, it is the most challenging part in breeding programmes because yield is the most variable and complex trait influenced by several environmental and genetic factors (Pimsaen et al., 2010; Sreedhar et al., 2011; Christopher and Sangodoyin, 2011). The current practice of crossing between elite lines of Oryza sativa is expected to reduce genetic variability in the working germplasm and slow down the discovery of novel traits to improve yield. Yield level in the released varieties has plateaued due to the narrow genetic base in parental lines used in crossing procedure (Tanksley and McCouch, 1997). One of the alternatives for increasing agriculture production is to identify the genes lost or weakened during the domestication process and use them in subsequent targeted breeding programmes (Shakiba and Eizenga, 2014). The wild species of the genus Oryza serve as a nearly untapped reservoir of genetic diversity that can be used to improve the world’s most important food crop, rice. The high diversity existing in wild rice species as they have not undergone rigorous human selection, makes them potential sources of important agronomic traits for exploitation by plant breeders for varietal improvement (Brar and Khush 1997; Gur and Zamir, 2004; Xie et al., 2008; Yadav et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2013).

This was demonstrated by Khush et al., (1977), by introgressing the gene for resistance to grassy stunt virus from $O$ . nivara to cultivated rice. Since then, wild species have been widely used for introgression of several agronomically important traits such as tolerance to biotic stresses like blast (Jeung et al., 2007), brown planthopper (Rahman et al., 2009; Jena and Kim, 2010; Sarao et al., 2016), and bacterial leaf blight (Natrajkumar et al., 2011). O. nivara, a cross compatible wild species of rice with AA genome is known as a source of important genes like cytoplasmic male sterility (Li et al, 2005), resistance to grassy stunt virus (Brar and Khush, 1997), bacterial leaf blight (Cheema et al., 2008) and BPH (brown planthopper) (Madurangi et al., 2013; Sarao et al., 2016). Introgression from nonAA genome species Oryza minuta (CCDD) was used in the successful transfer of blast resistance genes and $O$ . australiensis (EE) for blast and BPH resistance genes into $O$ . sativa (Jena and Khush,2000; Fu et al., 2008; Suh et al., 2014).

It was reported that transferring yieldenhancing segments/ QTLs into the genetic background of elite varieties (Kaladhar et al., 2008; Fu et al, 2010; Bai et al., 2012; Thalapati et al., 2012; Gaikwad et al., 2014; Swamy et al., 2014; Surapaneni et al., 2017) helped in the identification of improved cultivars with wild introgressions (Sarla et al., 2009). In India, Dhanarasi and Jarava are two rice varieties released for increased yield and they were derived from crosses with $O$ . rufipogon (Ram et al., 2007, 2010). DRR Dhan 40, a medium duration rice variety (BIL derived from Swarna $\\times O$ . nivara IRGC81848) was released for Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu states of India (Sarla, 2014; Haritha et al., 2016). Improving mega varieties which are well adapted, farmer accepted, popular and with good grain quality for any specific trait, is an important strategy in crop breeding programmes. In the present study, RILs derived from a cross between cultivar Swarna and BIL166s were used to understand the correlations among the yield and grain shape related traits. ",

In Kharif 2019 days to fifty percent flowering (with thousand grain weight, filled grains and harvest index), plant height (with productive tiller number, total tiller number and filled grains), thousand grain weight (with days to fifty percent flowering, productive tiller number and total tiller number) and harvest index (with days to fifty percent flowering, unfilled grains and biomass) showed the significant and negative correlations with the majority of the traits under study. HI showed significant and positive association with thousand grain weight, number of filled grains, and single plant yield. It showed significant and negative association with days to fifty percent flowering, unfilled grains and biomass. Balakrishnan et al., (2016) observed that single plant yield exhibited a highly significant association with panicle weight, biomass and harvest index in the introgression lines derived from Oryza sativa cv. Swarna /Oryza nivara. ",

Plant height showed significant, positive relationship with days to fifty percent flowering, panicle length, panicle weight and biomass. This corroborates with the findings of Immanuel et al., (2011) for panicle length. Productive tiller number and total tiller number had a strong and positive association with each other and moderate positive association with single plant yield and biomass. Immanuel et al, (2011), and Sudhakar et al., (2012) also reported the significant and positive association of total tiller number with productive tiller number.

        "text": "For some traits, significant associations were observed only in one season (Table 1). Following associations were significant and positive in Rabi 2018/19 season only. Days to fifty percent flowering with productive tiller number and single plant yield; plant height with single plant yield; productive tiller number with panicle length; panicle length with single plant yield; panicle weight with biomass; unfilled grains with biomass and grain length; harvest index with grain length/width ratio; grain weight with grain area and grain perimeter. Following associations were significant and negative, productive tiller number with harvest index and grain length; total tiller number with harvest index, grain length and grain perimeter; number of filled grains with biomass and grain length. In Kharif 2019 only association among plant height with unfilled grains; panicle weight with  number of filled grains and harvest index;  number of filled grains with single plant yield were significant and positive, while following associations were significant and negative, days to fifty percent flowering with thousand grain weight; plant height with productive tiller number, total tiller number and  number of filled grains; productive tiller number with panicle weight, thousand grain weight; total tiller number with panicle weight, thousand grain weight; panicle weight with unfilled grains; thousand grain weight with biomass; unfilled grains with single plant yield; single plant yield with grain perimeter. Bagati et al, (2016) reported panicle length exhibited significant positive and negative association with grain yield during 2014 and 2015, respectively. The major reason for this difference in trait association is mainly the varying environmental conditions. After transplanting, the 21 days old seedlings in the field were exposed to total submergence for few days and partially for about ten days due to heavy rains in Kharif 2019. In general, the observed disparity in cultivation conditions, the inconsistencies in individual genotype expression, are reasonable causes for fluctuations in environmental indices (Adesola, 2013). Trait associations showed seasonal variation mainly due to the fact that genotypic performance depends on environmental conditions (Bose et al., 2014: Balakrishnan et al., 2016). Similar observations on GEI were made by Tariku et al., (2013) and Akter et al., (2014) on multi-environment studies using rice genotypes. ",

Biomass showed significant positive correlations with the majority of traits, followed by days to fifty percent flowering in both seasons. Among all the traits, highest significant and strong positive correlation was observed between grain length and grain perimeter followed by productive tiller number and total tiller number in Rabi season. When harvest index showed significant negative correlations with majority of the yield contributing traits followed by filled grains in Rabi season, days to fifty percent flowering, plant height, 1000 grain weight  and harvest index showed the same correlations in Kharif season. Grain shape traits were interrelated with each other significantly in both seasons. Grain length had a significant, positive and moderate association with grain length/width ratio, grain area and a high association with grain perimeter. Single plant yield showed a moderate positive association with both productive and total tillers per plant, panicle weight, biomass and harvest index in both seasons. According to our results, the focus on productive tiller number and panicle weight will be most helpful while selecting the genotypes in the field for higher yield in this population. ",

So far, no substantial studies have been carried out on WRC and literature is scanty.

Data between 2009-10 and 2014- 15 shows that there has been a large increase in the production of rice and substantial decrease in annual requirement for rice in the region. Since Mizoram has a conducive climate to practice WRC, bringing a sizable proportion of arable land under WRC can help in efforts to attain self-sufficiency in food grain. The second important component of WRC is adequate irrigation. So, if irrigation facilities can be extended to rain-fed areas, intensive irrigation can meet the water requirements under the situation of high climate variability and change. A system of rice intensification can also be a suitable approach to increase the production under WRC. Also, more arable land can be devoted to WRC under the Rabi crop in all the districts. A sustainable practice of WRC will reduce the number of people living in BPL and progress towards attaining self-sufficiency in food grain and food security. ",

Globally, it is the second most cultivated cereal crop next to wheat. India ranks first in area ( $43.79\\mathrm{~m~}$ . ha) and second in production $(109.70\\mathrm{MT})$ (Anonymous, 2018). Tamil Nadu is one of the major rice producing states in India. The rice crop is subjected to a considerable damage by nearly 300 species of insect pests; among them only 23 species are serious pests of rice (Pasalu and Katti, 2006). In India, out of the total loss incurred by different insect pests of paddy, 30 per cent damage is done by stem borer alone (Krishnaiah and Varma, 2012).

        "text": "Globally, rice stem borer management accounts for 50 per cent of the insecticides used in rice fields (Huesing and English, 2004). Overreliance on synthetic pesticides causes ecological adversity and health related problems (Carvalho, 2017). It has also led to an exponential increase in the number of insect species developing resistance to insecticides (Sparks and Nauen, 2015) and destruction of population of beneficial insects (Jafar et al., 2013). Rice ecosystem harbours a wide range of natural enemy complex (Singh and Kumawat, 2020). Parasappa (2017) reported a significant positive correlation of YSB population with the hymenopteran parasitoids of rice ecosystem. The extent of natural egg parasitism of yellow stem borer in rice ecosystem has been reported to a maximum of 95.00 per cent (Lakshmi et al., 2010). However, a significant reduction in predators and adults of the egg parasitoids Trichogramma sp., Telenomus sp. and Tetrastichus sp. has been reported in the insecticide treated rice plots compared to untreated plots (Rahaman and Stout, 2019). These reports suggest the potential role of indigenous parasitoids and the need for their conservation in situ for suppressing the population of YSB. The use of botanicals in pest management is the best alternative to insecticides as they are safe to environment and compatible with natural enemies and other beneficial organisms. With this in view, a preliminary study was conducted in the laboratory to evaluate the detrimental effect of botanicals on different stages of yellow stem borer and their safety to the egg parasitoids of YSB.

The bases of rice stems were wrapped with foam and placed horizontally in a tray with thin film of water to enable the development of roots from both the nodes to keep the stems fresh and turgid for longer period. Then the larvae (10 neonate/ cut stem) were introduced into the small slit made at the centre of the rice stem with the help of camel hair brush. The top of the tray was covered with muslin cloth and fastened with rubber band to prevent the larvae from escaping and to keep the stems fresh and turgid by maintaining the humid condition in the tray. The larvae were transferred to fresh rice stems at two days interval until they pupated. After pupation, each stem was split opened from the middle of the stem up to the site of pupation. This facilitates easy emergence of the adult from the pupa in the laboratory. The stems with pupae were kept inverted in a glass vial with water and kept inside the adult emergence cage to keep the stems moist until the adults emerged from the pupae.

Natural parasitism of YSB egg masses was observed at a maximum rate which leads to the effective control of YSB at the egg stage itself.

Among them, sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris (Frank) Donk) anastomosis group 1 IA (AG-1 IA) is a serious disease worldwide (Rush and Lee, 1983). The sheath blight disease of rice is prevalent in almost all the rice growing countries of the world. Sheath blight is an important soil borne fungal disease causing annually up to 40 per cent of yield losses. The symptoms of the disease include greenish grey watersoaked spots development on the outer most sheaths of rice. As the disease progresses, spots enlarge and coalesce forming larger lesions with grayish-white center surrounded by tan to brown irregular borders or outlines. Sclerotia surviving in the soil are the major source of infection (Damicone and Jackson, 1996). When sclerotia come into contact with a rice plant, they germinate and the hyphae produce infection cushions on the exposed leaf sheath. Haustoria grow from the infection cushions, penetrate the host tissue, and develop  typical green gray, water-soaked lesions (Dodman and Flentje, 1970). ",

Symptoms initially occur on leaf sheaths near the water line as water-soaked lesions which are greenish gray in colour. As the disease progresses, they enlarge and tend to coalesce. Secondary infections are caused by hyphae growing upward towards uninfected plant parts, producing additional lesions and sclerotia to complete the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ cycle. Such sclerotia fall down and spread to adjacent plants through irrigation water. These sclerotia can survive in soil for longer period and the inoculum can survive in the infected plant debris. Large lesions formed on infected sheaths of lower rice leaves may lead to softness of the stem and lodging thereby causing considerable yield loss. Visible disease symptoms include formation of lesions, plant lodging and presence of ill-filled grains. ",

        "text": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the second most important cereal and the staple food for more than half of the world’s population. It provides 20 per cent of the world’s dietary energy supply followed by Maize and Wheat. Sheath blight incited by $R$ . solani is one of the potentially devastating disease of rice in almost all over the rice growing countries of the world. In India, intensive and extensive cultivation of rice mostly under rice-wheat cropping system have resulted heavy losses to the crop ranging from 5.2 to 70 per cent in yield. Losses due to sheath blight disease generally vary from 30 to 40 per cent and may be even 100 per cent in endemic areas (Li et al., 2009). The reduction in yield due to the disease has been estimated to vary from 5.2 to 50.0 per cent (Ou, 1985, Hori 1969). Per cent relative lesion height (RLH) was to the tune of 68.68 percent (Naik et al., 2017).The disease development was favoured due to the application of high doses of nitrogenous fertilizers, close plant spacing, widespread cultivation of high yielding varieties and weather conditions such as low light, cloudy days and high relative humidity. Infected plants are usually found in a circular pattern, locally referred to as ‘bird’s nest’ (Hollier et al., 2009). The disease appears at tillering stage on leaf sheath as elliptical or oval to irregular, $1{-}3~\\mathrm{cm}$ long, greenish gray spots with brown margin at or above the water line. Presence of many such spots on the leaf sheath gives the appearance of snake skin. Under favourable conditions, the infection spreads rapidly to the upper plant parts and also to the neighbouring plants by means of normal emergence and expansion of the ears and results in poor filling of the grains. The pathogen is also known to cause panicle infection resulting in production of unfilled or partially filled discoloured seed bearing brownish black spots or black to ashy gray patches (Acharya et al., 2004). The use of pesticides caused an incredible harm to the environment and hazard in natural ecosystems, which resulted into replacement of chemicals with biological approaches, which are considered more environment friendly in the long term. One of the emerging research area for the management of different phytopathogenic factors is the application of antagonistic plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), which are capable of suppressing the phytopathogen damage. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to assess the bio-efficacy of Pseudomonas fluorescens for the management of Sheath blight in paddy. ",

        "text": "Results are inconformity with Johnson et al., (2013) who found hexaconazole as an effective fungicide against sheath blight of rice. Naik et al., (2017) found that the field efficacy of hexaconazole 5EC $(0.1\\%)$ and propiconazole 25EC $(0.1\\%)$ could be used effectively for the management of sheath blight disease of rice and thus helped for getting higher grain yield and B: C ratio. $P.$ fluorescens is ideal antagonist as they have ability to produce various inhibitory antimicrobial compounds (Schroth and Hancock, 1982). Maximum increase of all the growth parameters was recorded with combination of $P.$ fluorescens and T. harzianum. Singh and Sinha (2009) observed growth promotion due to seed treatment with $T.$ harzianum and $P.$ fluorescens which enhanced nitrogen uptake and alleviated drought stress in rice crop. Tiwary and Trimurty (2009) also reported lowest disease severity under field conditions through seed treatment along with two foliar sprays of $P.$ fluorescens over foliar application of carbendazim $50\\%$ WP as untreated control. Neha et al., (2016) also recorded that seed treatment with $P.$ fluorescens $\\textcircled{a}10\\mathrm{ml}\\mathrm{kg}{-}1$ along with seedling dipping of roots $\\textcircled{a}3.0\\mathrm{~l~ha-l}$ significantly enhanced the germination $(75.82\\%)$ , plant height (25.52), number of tillers (16.99) and grain yield (48.23 g pot-1 ). $P.$ fluorescens has emerged as a potential bio control agent due to different modes of action such as competition for nutrients and space, antibiosis, mycoparasitism, induced systemic resistance, production of siderophore, phytohormones, production of lytic enzymes and various secondary metabolites such as DAPG, Phenazine, pyoluteorin, pyrollnitrin, which are helpful in reducing pathogen population within soil (Gupta et al., 2002). Thus, the finding of present investigations is quite in conformity with the reports of earlier workers. However, hexaconazole (triazole fungicide) is a potent ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor and sterol in most fungi and hence resulted comparatively higher effectiveness than bio-agents, because it persists for a longer period inside the plant system and protects crop against sheath blight constantly for a longer period.

        "text": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most significant cereal crops in India. It is nutritionally and agronomically most essential crop of the world and feeds nearly 3.2 billion people. Rice production in India has increased from 82.5 million tonnes during the period of 1997-98 to 114 million tonnes in 2018- 19 (Anonymous, 2019). But projected figures for future indicate that the present levels of production are not sufficient to feed the population of the country. The low productivity of rice in India is ascribed to many abiotic and biotic stress factors. With respect to biotic factors, diseases viz., blast, bacterial leaf blight, sheath blight, sheath rot, false smut, and brown spot are wide-spread and economically important. In recent decades, a number of minor diseases have attained the status of major importance in rice. One such disease is the rice false smut (RFS) disease which is a threat to yield and grain quality. The disease has been reported in more than 40 countries, especially in rice growing Asian nations such as China, India and Burma (Wang et al., 2019). ",

The disease can cause $2.8\\mathrm{-}$ $81\\%$ yield losses in different rice-producing areas depending on the rice variety and disease intensity. Earlier the disease was considered as minor due to its sporadic occurrence but in recent decades there has been an increase in incidence because of extensive cultivation of rice hybrids and wider application of nitrogenous fertilizers (Ladhalakshmi et al., 2019). RFS occurrence can be seen when incidence of rainfall coincides with the booting and heading stages of the rice crop. However, epidemics vary between varieties and season. In this study, we have undertaken a survey to know the natural incidence of false smut in various genotypes grown in Rajendranagar farm, ICAR-IIRR. ",

AICRP on Rice is the largest research network on a single crop comprising of 45 funded and over 100 voluntary centres covering all the rice growing states in the country. Realizing the limitations imposed by the ecosystem complexities, destabilizing insect pests and disease problems as well as grain quality requirements of different varieties/ cultivars of rice consumed, AICRIP evolved need based programmes / trials over the years to identify suitable genotypes of high yield potential along with appropriate crop management practices. During the initial phase i.e. in the first decade, emphasis was given to achieve higher yields through improved plant type largely for irrigated areas. This led to the development of short statured high yielding varieties (HYVs), which heralded the process of “Green Revolution” in India. During 80s, yield stability and quality improvement received major attention. This led to the development of varieties possessing major biotic stress tolerance and desirable quality to develop prototype of semidwarf basmati rice varieties. Nineties witnessed efforts in developing suitable hybrid rice technology and multi-location testing to validate their superiority over varietal checks at least by $10\\%$ as well as nonbasmati quality trials targeting the export markets. During 2000s emphasis was on soil stress trials for problem soil areas, aerobic trials laying emphasis on developing genotypes for water limited environments and hill trials for incorporating cold tolerance. In recent times, emphasis has been on the near isogenic line development for quick evaluation of marker assisted selection (MAS) derived products introgressed with genes conferring resistance/tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses. Additionally, nutritional security is stressed by enriching the grain with micronutrients such as zinc, iron along with protein (Babu et al., 2016). ",

Till date more than 28,300 elite lines developed by different cooperating centres were tested in multi-location trials across the country under the umbrella of All India Coordinated Rice Improvement Programme (AICRIP) at funded, voluntary centres and in partnership with private sector for hybrid rice.

Sangi Nagaiah/Tummala Muralidhar of Aroor village, Valigonda mandal, Yadadri Bhuvanagiri District of Telangana, during Kharif 2020 in four acres. Breeders carried out regular field visits and undertook rouging to maintain the seed purity and explained the importance of carrying out rouging in seed production plots to the farmers (Figure 3). Farmers checked for the presence of roughs along with their regular farming activities. Farmers appreciated the traits of DRR Dhan 48 in terms of its desirable plant height (slightly shorter than BPT 5204), resistance to bacterial blight despite not taking up plant protection measures and grain type akin to BPT 5204 and appreciated high (15-18) productive tillers per plant. An average yield of 5104 $\\mathrm{{kg/ha}}$ was obtained in the farmer’s field under late sown conditions indicating the suitability of DRR Dhan 48 cultivation under late sown conditions. Seed samples collected from farmer’s field as well as from IIRR Rajendranagar farm were used for zinc estimation at International Rice Research Institute South Asia Hub (IRRISAH), ICRISAT, Hyderabad. The average zinc content in seed samples collected in farmer’s field ranged from 25.2 to 27.4 and 22.2 to $23.3\\mathrm{ppm}$ in brown and polished rice, respectively, while in seed samples of IIRR farm ranged from 24.9 to 27.1 and 21.0 to $21.3~\\mathrm{ppm}$ in brown and polished rice, respectively. Varietal release to field performance of DRR Dhan 48 is schematically represented in Figure 4. ",
