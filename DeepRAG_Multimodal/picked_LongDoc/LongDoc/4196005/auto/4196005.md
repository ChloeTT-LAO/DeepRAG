# Executive Summary  

# INTRODUCTION  

A Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is part of an ongoing, collaborative health improvement process. Through community engagement and participation, the CHNA identifies and prioritizes health-related needs and analyzes a broad range of social, economic, environmental, and behavioral factors that may contribute to health needs or influence health outcomes of residents.  

Information from the CHNA is used as a guide to develop a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) which aims to address the prioritized needs. The CHNA/CHIP cycle ensures that strategies to improve population health are data-driven and focused on the current needs of those who live, learn, work, and play in the community.  

Kent County’s 2020 CHNA was conducted by the Kent County Health Department (KCHD), local health systems, and ove 50 community-based organizations and dedicated partners.  

# REPORT GOALS & OBJECTIVES  

The purpose of this report is to serve as a foundation for community decision making and health improvement efforts. Key objectives of this report include:  

1. Describe the process used to collect community input and prioritize health-related needs   
2. Highlight community voices and their experiences   
3. Describe the current state of health and well-being in Kent County using recent data on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health outcomes, health risks, and social determinants of health, with a specific focus on how these factors differ by race, ethnicity, age, sex, and income.   
4. Identify community strengths, resources, forces of change, and service gaps   
5. Consider how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Kent County residents and systems  

# DATA COLLECTION  

The CHNA findings detailed throughout this report are based on data collected through a variety of primary (collected for this assessment) and secondary (existing data) sources.  

To accurately identify, understand, and prioritize the health-related needs in Kent County, this assessment combines quantitative data (such as the number of people affected, changes over time, and differences between groups) and qualitative data (such as community input, perspectives, and experiences). Together, both types of data help to describe the current state of health and ensure the CHNA results are community-driven—ultimately providing a more complete view of health and quality of life in Kent County.

# KEY FINDINGS  

Following analysis of community input data, 11 top health-related needs were identified:  

o Access to Care o Economic Security o Arthritis o Food & Nutrition $0$ Chronic Pain o Housing $0$ Diabetes o Mental Health $0$ Discrimination & Racial o Obesity Inequity o Stress & Social Support  

—Local public health system partner  

“Many of these have an impact on the others. If we could fix X, then it would address Y.”  

After considering the qualitative and quantitative data surrounding each health need, local leaders and community partners participated in a multi-step process to prioritize which issues should be addressed through health improvement plans. Using criteria-based ranking, stakeholders scored each health need according to 1) importance in the community; 2) if there are disparities or inequities in who is most impacted, and 3) our ability to address the need. Based on the total ranking scores, the following four topics were prioritized as the most significant health-related needs:  

# ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE  

Affordable health care for those who need it and information sharing of available resources to live a healthy life.  

# DISCRIMINATION AND RACIAL INEQUITY  

The policies and practices that create a culture of inclusivity and belonging, and advance health equity.  

# ECONOMIC SECURITY  

The ability of individuals and families to afford their basic needs and have an equal opportunity to save and build wealth.  

# MENTAL HEALTH  

Prevention and treatment of psychological, emotional, and relational issues that lead to higher quality of life.  

# NEXT STEPS  

These four health priorities reflect the importance of addressing some of the upstream factors that contribute to poor health outcomes in Kent County. Over the next few months, KCHD will begin the three-year CHIP cycle and develop goals and strategies to address the health priorities—either by supporting existing community initiatives or working with partners to create new initiatives. This process will require continuing community engagement, forming new partnerships, and expanding cross-sector collaboration. KCHD is dedicated to working with and listening to the community to best address these needs, improve health outcomes, and advance health equity in Kent County.

# WHAT BARRIERS PREVENTED YOU FROM ACCESSING NEEDED HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES?  

“Lack of health insurance. I make slightly   
too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too   
little to be able to afford a decent health insurance plan. This situation creates constant stress regarding struggling to   
afford mental health care and fearing that   
any type of physical health emergency will lead to medical bankruptcy.”  

“I can’t afford to add additional costs to my budget—I can’t pay the resulting bills. And I don’t have days available to take time off of work.”  

“Unsure which providers take my insurance.”  

2020 KENT COUNTY HEALTH PRIORITIES  

# Discrimination & Racial Inequity  

# Defi[Inmitpiorotan  

# Importance  

Discrimination refers to policies, practices, and behaviors that unfairly advantage some and disadvantage others based on socially defined characteristics such as race (racism), gender, age, ability, or sexual orientation.  

Racial inequities refer to unfair or unjust differences in health outcomes and factors influencing health (such as education, housing, employment, environment, etc.) along racial or ethnic lines.  

Discrimination has been linked to health problems such as anxiety, depression, obesity, high blood pressure, and substance abuse. 2 It may also cause people to not participate in health-promoting behaviors such as cancer screening, diabetes management, and condom use.3  

At the systems-level, discriminatory policies and institutional practices create unhealthy living environments and restrict access to social and economic opportunities. This structural discrimination—particularly racism—is a driving force of the social determinants of health and an additional barrier to health equity.4  

“This community is not inviting for   
African-Americans,   
for black and brown   
people. It just is not   
our community. And our systems here   
are not reflective of black and brown communities.”  

# Discrimination and Stress  

High stress levels can contribute to a variety of physical and mental health problems. According to community survey respondents, discrimination was more often   
reported as a frequent or constant stressor among people   
of color, people who identify as LGBTQ, and people with disabilities.  

![](images/50f642173fbb14fd5262485dab7273dd33e3519eef1066017533c921799e3368.jpg)  

# Discrimination and Health Care  

Discrimination was described as a barrier to receiving quality, affordable care, particularly among:  

People who have a disability (physical, hearing, and vision), who are transgender, or who speak a language other than English.  

# RACIAL INEQUITIES IN KENT COUNTY  

On average, when compared to their White counterparts, Black residents in Kent County are more likely to have:  

# Lower household incomes  

![](images/55b9a97b51a3ba92359e56f18e0b72f316fa8b3cbb9ab9642bb5b51e1d973c6f.jpg)  

For every $\$100$ in income earned by White households, Black households earn $\$52.29$

2 times as likely to have diabetes or prediabetes   
1.7 times as likely to have high blood pressure   
1.5 times more likely to die of cardiovascular disease  

“It's an excellent community to raise family. It's a good place to live. But it all goes back to who you are, what color you are. There is not a lot of opportunities for people of color.”  

–Focus Group Participant  

# Economic Security  

# Definition  

Economic security refers to the ability of individuals or households to cover their essential needs (such as housing, food, clothing and hygiene, and education) sustainably and with dignity.1  

# KEY INDICATORS:  

Gener al Finances How finances usually work out at the end of the month (some money left, just enough money, or not enough to make ends meet)  

Wages Average weekly wages  

Material Hardship  

Percent of adults who were unable to pay for housing, food, or medical care in the past year  

# Importance  

Health and wealth are closely linked. Economic disadvantage affects health by limiting choice and access to things like proper nutrition, safe neighborhoods, transportation, and other elements that define an individual’s standard of living. Whereas economic  prosperity provides people with resources that can be used to avoid or buffer exposu re to health risks and protect people from chronic stress.2  

IN KENT COUNTY, ADULTS WITH LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT poor physical and mental health, frequent stress, low access to health care, tobacco use, physical inactivity, and higher rates of chronic disease (such as asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) compared to those with higher household incomes.  

# Monthly Finances  

In general, how do your finances usually work out at the end of the month?

jobs.”  

“Lack of investment in lower-income neighborhoods.”  

“Being so close to the Medical Mile some of the corporate changes are being catered mostly to the higher income people.  

“Gentrification leaves out poor people and people of color.”  

# Mental Health  

# Definition  

Mental health is a state of emotional, psychological, and social well-being resulting in productive activities, fulfillin[gDefirneiltaitoinonssohuirpcse] with other people, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with challenges.  

Mental illness refers collectively to all diagnoseable menta  disorders. Mental disorders are health conditions that signif cantly affect mood, emotion, thinking or behavior, and often impact day-to-day living or ability to function. 2  

# Importance  

Mental health is essential to a person’s wellbeing, healthy family and interpersonal relationships, and the ability to live a full and productive life. Mental health also plays a major role in people’s ability to maintain good physical health. People, including children and adolescents, with untreated mental health disorders are at high risk for many unhealthy and unsafe behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse, violent or self-destructive behavior, and suicide. Mental illness also increases the risk for many chronic health conditions including diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart disease,

# Introduction  

As part of an ongoing community health improvement process, local public health system partners in Kent County conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) every three years, followed by a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). The 2020 CHNA and subsequent 2021-2024 CHIP will be Kent County’s fourth community health improvement cycle.  

A CHNA is a systematic method of collecting and analyzing community input and health-related data from a variety of sources. The goal of the CHNA process is to engage residents and community partners to better understand the current state of health and well-being in the community and identify key problems and assets. CHNA findings are used to guide community decision-making, prioritize public health issues, and develop a health improvement plan to address identified needs.  

# Purpose  

Nationally accredited public health departments are required to conduct a comprehensive CHNA every five years, and the Affordable Care Act requires non-profit hospital systems to conduct a CHNA every three years (both followed by a CHIP or action plan to address the identified health needs). These requirements ensure that health systems are investing in population health and that efforts are community-driven and based on the most recent data.  

As with past CHNAs, the Kent County Health Department (KCHD), five local health systems, and dozens of community organizations and coalitions partner together to fund and conduct a joint CHNA that is reflective of the entire Kent County community. This collaborative approach to population health helps strengthen cross-sector partnerships, leverage expertise and existing resources, and reduce duplicate efforts to better serve the community.  

# Framework  

Since the first Kent County CHNA in 2011, KCHD has used the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) framework to guide the process. MAPP is a nationally recognized, best-practice framework for community health needs assessment and improvement planning processes that was developed by the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NAACHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It’s intended to be an ongoing, continuous cycle of maintaining and expanding partnerships and regularly conducting assessments, so improvement efforts are based on the current needs of the community.1  

The key CHNA phases of MAPP include partner engagement, collecting and compiling data, and identifying strategic issues.  

# Social & Structural Determinants of Health  

The 2020 Kent County CHNA is based on the principle that health is not determined by individual behaviors and genetics alone. A key focus of this report is on non-clinical factors—such as income, race, ethnicity, and geography—as well as the economic, social, and built environments that make it easier or harder to be healthy, and the systems that shape these opportunities and environments.  

# PARTNER ENGAGEMENT  

The MAPP framework relies on a participatory process and includes stakeholders in every step (assessment, planning, and implementation) to ensure that the CHNA process is inclusive and representative of the community.  

# DATA COLLECTION – THE FOUR MAPP ASSESSMENTS  

MAPP includes four different assessments, each providing unique insights into population health within a community. Although all four assessments are not required to identify the most pressing health needs, combining the results of multiple assessments helps to paint the clearest picture of community health issues and systems.  

# Community Health Status Assessment  

The CHSA is a compilation of quantitative data to describe the population and overall state of health in the community, including the factors and conditions that impact long-term health outcomes and quality of life.  

# Community Themes & Strengths Assessment  

The CTSA identifies assets in the community and issues that are important to residents. This assessment relies on public participation to collect information on the opinions and experiences of community members and helps to ensure they are the primary source of input used to identify the top health needs.  

# Forces of Change Assessment  

The FOCA identifies forces, trends, or events that may impact health in the community. It also examines the opportunities and threats associated with those forces.  

# Local Public Health System Assessment  

The LPHSA measures how well different local public health system partners work together to deliver the 10 Essential Public Health Services.  

# IDENTIFYING STRATEGIC ISSUES  

his phase of MAPP involves reviewing the assessment data to identify key issues and prioritize the most pressing health needs in the community.  

The CHIP process addresses the last two phases of the MAPP framework: develop goals and strategies, and the action cycle. Using the CHNA data as a guide, goals and strategies are created to address the prioritized health needs through collective action and continued partnership development. In the action cycle, these strategies are implemented and evaluated over a three-year period.  

# Partner Engagement  

Multi-sector engagement and community participation throughout the CHNA help to ensure the process is communitydriven and that a broad range of expertise and input is included. Staff at KCHD facilitated the overall assessment process and convened community partners, including individuals and agencies who have historically participated in Kent County’s CHNA and/or CHIP process, as well as new partners and community sectors that were missing from previous assessments. Individuals from more than 50 organizations participated in the 2020 CHNA process. These community partners serve or represent several populations of interest (i.e., who generally face greater health challenges or inequities) including people with disabilities, aging adults, people of color, people experiencing homelessness, low-income, LGBTQ, and rural communities; and a broad range of sectors within the local public health system such as neighborhood associations, hospitals, schools, mental health organizations, non-profits, and social service agencies. A complete list of organizations that participated in the development of the CHNA is provided in the Acknowledgements section of this report.  

Community partners were involved in various capacities. The CHNA Committee designed the community survey and dissemination plan; identified and invited new community partners to join the CHNA process; and provided subject matter expertise throughout the assessment period. Additional agencies and partners participated in assessment activities such as conducting focus groups, survey promotion, and prioritization.  

# Data Collection  

Primary and secondary data were collected using mixed methods from a variety of sources to get a more complete understanding of the issues that affect health and quality of life in Kent County. Data collection activities were guided by the MAPP assessment objectives.  

# COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT  

The CHSA includes more than 55 indicators of health using primary data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey and secondary data from over 25 sources. Indicators were selected to broadly describe the population and socioeconomic characteristics of Kent County; the social and structural determinants of health (such as poverty, housing, and built environments); and common health risk behaviors. Morbidity and mortality indicators were selected based on the leading causes of death and hospitalizations in Kent County.  

# Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey  

The BRFSS is an ongoing telephone survey that collects information about health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The BRFSS is conducted at the state-level and supported by the CDC to collect nationally representative data. To obtain local-level data, KCHD contracted with Issues & Answers Network, a marketing research firm, to conduct a BRFSS in Kent County. There were 14 core sections and eight additional modules included in the questionnaire.  

Data collection took place from February 3 to March 22, 2020. Surveys were conducted via telephone interview (landline and cell phone) and offered in English and Spanish. Adults were randomly selected to participate based on a sample of households in Kent County. To provide population-specific results, Hispanic/Latino and African American residents were oversampled. Trained interviewers from Issues & Answers conducted a total of 1,375 telephone interviews $37\%$ via landline and $63\%$ via cell phone). The response rate was $15\%$ and the refusal rate was $1.7\%$ . Each completed interview lasted, on average, approximately 24 minutes.  

The BRFSS data included in this report are weighted to adjust for gender, age, race, and ethnicity using the 2010 Kent County Census population estimates. Some statistics were compiled by Issues & Answers and additional analysis of the dataset was completed by KCHD using SPSS statistical software. Due to the large, randomly selected sample, BRFSS results are likely representative of the Kent County population which allows for generalizability of the findings and comparison of trends over time.  

# Secondary Data Collection  

Data synthesis and secondary analysis were conducted using a variety of existing local, state, and national sources. Frequently used data sources (abbreviated throughout the report) include:  

$0$ ACS 1-year and 5-year estimates: American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau o CDC WONDER: Database of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics o MDHHS: Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Division for Vital Records and Health Statistics; Michigan Disease Surveillance System; and Michigan Resident Inpatient Files $0$ MiPHY: Michigan Profile for Healthy Youth survey, conducted by the Michigan Department of Education  

Additional information from the CDC, Healthy People 2020 and 2030, County Health Rankings, and America’s Health Rankings was used to describe the importance of each topic and its relation to health. Specific citations are included throughout the report.  

# COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT  

Community input data was collected through a community survey and focus groups. Both were designed and conducted fter the COVID-19 state-wide shutdown.  

# Community Survey  

One form of community input collected was through a self-administered survey. The survey was developed by the CHNA committee and contained 54 questions on a variety of topics including: COVID 19, stress and social support, neighborhood characteristics, and barriers to health services. It also asked respondents to identify the top five health conditions and social determinants of health that have the greatest impact on them, their household, or their community (see Appendix C for survey instrument).  

Surveys were administered electronically through Qualtrics (an online survey collection tool) in both English and Spanish. Paper surveys were also made available upon request for community partners to distribute. The survey was open for approximately nine weeks, from August 4 to October 9. Partner organizations assisted with survey promotion via social media and community outreach. Overall, 1,695 people responded to the survey (however, N-values differ since not all respondents answered each question). See Appendix B for survey respondent demographics.  

# Focus Groups  

To ensure a wide range of public input was collected, additional qualitative data was collected via community-led virtual focus groups. KCHD contracted with seven organizations and provided training on focus group facilitation. Representatives from partner organizations recruited five to eight participants and hosted virtual conversations using Zoom or other web-based meeting platforms. Facilitators were given a discussion guide with questions asking participants about:  

o Key characteristics of a healthy community   
o Strengths and assets for health where they live, and things that are lacking   
o The most important issues that need to be addressed to improve quality of life and overall health   
$0$ How these issues could be addressed

Focus groups were conducted in September 2020 and each lasted between 60-90 minutes. Each group discussion was recorded and sent to KCHD for analysis. The de-identified audio recordings were transcribed, checked for accuracy, then coded and analyzed thematically using NVivo (a qualitative data analysis software). The frequency with which a topic or theme was discussed across all seven focus groups was used to identify health-related needs and draw conclusions about how they impact the broader community. Selected quotes from the focus groups are presented throughout this report to support some of the key findings.  

# FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT  

The FOCA was conducted in partnership with Grand Valley State University. Data collection was completed by graduate students in the Master of Public Administration program as part of the Community Benefits and Assessment Management course in July 2020.  

Students engaged 30 local leaders and professionals who are knowledgeable of the political, economic, technological, environmental, or social issues affecting Kent County or general public health. Current events, long-standing existing factors, and emerging issues were included in the initial forces identified. Forces were prioritized based on stakeholder input and the direct relation to community health. Qualitative data analysis was conducted by KCHD using NVivo qualitative analysis software. The top forces, along with general themes identified across the dataset are included in the report.

# LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT  

he LPHSA was planned for September 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant impact it has had on the local public health system and stakeholders, the assessment was not conducted for this iteration of the CHNA.  

# Identifying and Prioritizing Health Needs  

Based on analysis of community input data, 11 topics were identified as top health needs. These were determined based on how many survey respondents selected it as an issue that greatly affects them, their household, or community; and/or if the topic emerged as theme across multiple focus groups. Secondary data and local BRFSS data were used to describe the magnitude, trends, and public health implications of each significant health need identified by the community.  

The 11 health needs were then prioritized by local public health leaders and community partners to determine the most significant health needs the county should focus improvement efforts on. Three different prioritization meetings were held virtually in December 2020. During each two-hour meeting, primary and secondary data were presented to stakeholders before working through a multi-step prioritization process and facilitated group discussion. Using criteriabased ranking, participants scored each of the 11 health topics based on 1) importance in the community; 2) if there are disparities or inequities in who is most impacted, and 3) our ability to address the need (see Appendix A for prioritization tool). Final priorities were determined based on total ranking scores from 54 community partners across all three sessions and stakeholder input from group discussions.  

Based on the prioritization activities, the following health needs will be addressed through formal improvement plans and implementation strategies during the 2021-2024 fiscal years: access to health care, discrimination and racial inequity, economic security, and mental health.  

# Limitations & Data Gaps  

This assessment was designed to provide a broad overview of health and well-being and identify critical issues related to community health in Kent County. However, it is not inclusive of every health-related issue that residents face and does not represent all possible populations of interest.  

# COVID-19 LIMITATIONS  

Data in this report represent the most current, county-level sources at the time of publication. However, it’s important to note the source of data in relation to the COVID-19 timeline (see Figure 1). Many indicators reflect the state of health prior to the pandemic; however, community input data was collected during the pandemic.  

Gathering community input data on long-term health needs during the pandemic may have increased the likelihood of bias and/or measurement error. Committee members tried to account for this by strategically phrasing survey questions so the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic would not skew the responses. For example, “fear or closure due to COVID- $\cdot19^{\prime\prime}$ was a response option included when asking about barriers to accessing health care, so these could be filtered out during analysis to get a more accurate and reliable determination of barriers that exist beyond the pandemic. In consideration of some of these limitations, the process of prioritizing health needs was based on both quantitative data collected prior to the state shutdown in Michigan, and qualitative data collected amidst the pandemic.  

# COMMUNITY SURVEY  

Another limitation is the convenience sampling methodology used to conduct the community survey (dissemination online and via community organizations). Because the sample of survey respondents was not randomly selected, generalizability of the findings to the broader population is limited. Compared to the population of Kent County, people of color, men, and younger adults (age 25 and younger) were underrepresented among survey respondents, and those with a bachelor’s degree or higher were overrepresented (see Appendix B). Due to the pandemic restrictions and cancelation of community events, in-person surveying techniques could not be used purposively sample underrepresented populations. Additionally, dissemination was primarily conducted through social media and partner networks which may have further limited the scope of potential respondents and increased the likelihood for selection bias.  

# FOCUS GROUPS  

The goal of the focus groups was to obtain additional community input from populations that were underrepresented in the survey responses and get an in-depth perspective on issues from specific sub-populations. Although the focus groups provide valuable insights, results are not statistically representative of the larger Kent County population due to nonrandom recruiting of participants and a small sample size. Additionally, since recruitment was conducted by the community organizations that hosted and facilitated focus groups, many who participated were already involved in community programming and the responses may only provide one perspective on the issues discussed.  

# GAPS IN DATA  

For secondary data, the most recent year of data available differs depending on the source and health topic. Additionally, some data in this report cannot be stratified by race, ethnicity, income, education level, zip code, etc., limiting the ability to explore differences or disparities among some sub-populations. Not all comparisons between groups could be tested for statistical significance (e.g., some secondary data); however, significance is noted when applicable and all significant differences are based on the $95\%$ confidence interval.  

In effort to consolidate findings, data have been disaggregated to highlight disparities between groups and not every demographic group for which data is available is presented in the report. To request additional data that is not included in this report, see the report publication page.  

# Report Structure & Timeline  

Data from the health status assessment (BRFSS and secondary data), community themes and strengths assessment (survey and focus group data), and forces of change assessment have been synthesized and integrated into this report. As previously noted in the limitations, most data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and statewide shutdown, however community input and forces of change were collected after. This consideration may be useful when interpreting the findings.  

Throughout the report, community input is highlighted in green (i.e., collected after the pandemic affected Michigan) to differentiate from all other data collected before the pandemic (presented in blue). Community input, forces of change, and other data related to COVID-19 and its impact are highlighted in red. Other forces of change not related to the pandemic are presented in gold.

# Access to Health Care  

Access to affordable medical, dental, and mental health care is an important factor that contributes to length and quality of life. Timely access to regular health services and treatment can help prevent disease, detect and treat illness sooner, and manage chronic conditions, enabling individuals to live longer, healthier lives.  

# INDICATORS  

$0$ Health insurance coverage   
$0$ Utilization of emergency and preventive services   
o Capacity of health facilities   
o Availability of providers  

# KEY FINDINGS  

The percentage of adults age 18-64 who are uninsured has increased for the first time since 2008. Since 2017, there have been improvements in (i.e., an overall decrease in the percentage of adults who report):  

▪ Not having a primary care provider ▪ Not going to the doctor due to cost ▪ Not getting a routine checkup  

o Adults with household incomes between $\$35$ ,000- $\cdot\$5$ 49,999 were the only group to have worse access to care acros all four indicators.   
o Even with insurance, health care is still unaffordable for many in Kent County. Two out of three people who could not see a doctor when they needed to because of cost were insured.  

# COMMUNITY INPUT  

o In general, the health care resources, and quality of care are major strengths of Kent County, however access to these resources is not equitable.   
o The top barriers for accessing care include health insurance (navigating a complex system) and high cost of services.   
o Community input revealed several challenges and emerging issues related to access to health care: ▪ Lack of caregivers and home healthcare workers is an emerging issue for the aging population ▪ Access to and use of technology is a barrier for telehealth services, especially as telehealth use increases ▪ Lack of awareness of existing resources and health literacy (i.e., knowing the right questions to ask and advocating for yourself in healthcare settings) are also barriers for some community members.  

“If you have access, the care you can receive is pretty excellent, again, you have to know what to look for and where to go.”

# Health Insurance  

Health insurance can facilitate entry into and navigation of the healthcare system. Having coverage increases utilization of preventive care and allows for easier access to needed specialty care and emergency services. It also provides financial protection in case of a serious accident or illness.1  

Uninsured people are less likely to have a regular source of medical care, and more likely to delay routine medical care due to costs, have poor health status, receive late diagnoses, and die prematurely.2  

In 2020, the rate of uninsured adults increased at the local, state, and national levels for the first time since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 (Figure 4). In Kent County, the increase in uninsured adults from 2017 to 2020 was most significant among adults who are younger, Hispanic or Latino, and who have a household income between $\$20$ ,000- \$49,999 (Figure 3). Among those who are insured, over half have coverage through their employer and a quarter have Medicare or Medicaid as their primary insurance.  

# Community Input  

“Lack of health insurance. I make slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to be able to afford a   
decent health insurance plan.   
This situation creates constant   
stress regarding struggling to   
afford mental health care and fearing that any type of   
physical health emergency will lead to medical bankruptcy.”

# Affordability  

Even with insurance, the cost of health services can be prohibitive for many. In the past 12 months, $8.8\%$ of Kent County residents could not see a doctor when they needed to because of cost. This represents a sustained downward trend in cost barriers to care from $12.7\%$ in 2008. Of those who reported cost as a barrier to seeing a doctor, $69.1\%$ were insured. Among those who are uninsured, nearly one in three $(28.1\%)$ reported that they needed to see a doctor in the past 12 months but could not because of cost.2  

For those who are uninsured and do seek care, there are often financial implications. Unaffordable medical bills can quickly translate into debt since many who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings.1 In Kent County, $18\%$ of people have past-due medical debt.2 The rate of medical debt in communities of color is more than twice that of white communities.†  

# Utilization  

Utilization of preventive health care services, such as mammograms, pap tests, prostate exams, influenza vaccinations, blood sugar tests, and cholesterol tests could reduce the prevalence and severity of diseases and chronic conditions. An annual visit with a primary care provider is an indicator of preventive health care access and utilization.  

In Kent County, most adults $(79.5\%)$ ) have received a routine checkup within the past year. Females are significantly more likely to have had a recent checkup $(84.8\%)$ than males $(74.0\%)$ . Black residents are also more likely to have had a recent checkup $(91.8\%)$ than White $(79.0\%)$ and Hispanic or Latino $(71.7\%)$ residents. Approximately two out of three adolescents $(63.1\%)$ also had a routine checkup within the past year.3  

Emergency department (ED) visits for certain conditions may indicate lack of access to more appropriate sources of medical care, such as primary care providers or specialists.4 In Kent County and Michigan, the rate of ED visits decreased from 2015 to 2018.

One of the FOCA threats identified was long-term health consequences due to reduced health care utilization throughout the pandemic, particularly during the two-month statewide closure. Although residents could still access necessary health care, COVID-19 was the most frequently selected barrier to accessing needed health services in the past year, according to survey respondents. Delays in chronic disease care, elective procedures, and preventive screenings could have long-term consequences.  

# PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS  

Ambulatory care sensitive (ACS) hospitalizations are inpatient hospital stays that could be prevented through timely and effective primary care. In Kent County, $18.7\%$ of all hospital admissions in 2018 were for ACS conditions. Approximately four out of five ACS hospitalizations were for adults age 45 and older.5  

ACS hospitalization rate, per 10,000 people (2018):  

Kent County: 185.6   
Michigan: 287.8  

# Provider Availability & Capacity  

Having a usual source of care (either a provider or facility where one regularly receives care) is an important factor for accessing timely, quality services and better managing personal health. Having a primary care provider who serves as the usual source of care enables the patient and provider build a stable, long term relationship that is associated with numerous health benefits, such as receiving appropriate preventive care, lower health care costs, fewer ED visits, and improved management of chronic conditions:1  

Approximately 1 in 8 adults $(12.7\%)$ in Kent County do not have a personal health care provider. The rates are higher among Hispanic or Latino and Black adults compared to non-Hispanic and White adults. Socioeconomic status (household income and educational attainment) is also associated with the likelihood of having a personal health care provider.2

# Community-Identified Need  

CAREGIVERS, SUPPORT STAFF, AND HOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR AGING ADULTS.  

In Kent County, there are 6.5 home health care/ personal care aides per 100 adults over age $65^{3}$  

# Economic Status  

Health and wealth are closely linked. Economic disadvantage affects health by limiting choice and access to things like proper nutrition, safe neighborhoods, transportation, and other elements that define an individual’s standard of living; whereas economic prosperity provides people with resources that can be used to avoid or buffer exposure to health risks and protect people from chronic stress.1  

There are consistent income gradients in health outcomes (also often reflected in racial/ethnic differences) among adults in Kent County. Those with lower household income are more likely to report poor physical and mental health, food insecurity, frequent stress, low access to health care, and higher rates of chronic disease (such as asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) compared to those with higher household incomes.  

# INDICATORS  

o Unemployment   
$0$ Income inequality   
o Ability to afford basic needs   
$0$ Opportunity for upward mobility  

# KEY FINDINGS  

o Unemployment in Kent County was at the lowest point since 2010 before the COVID-19 pandemic. At the peak of unemployment during 2020, one in five adults were unemployed.   
o Black residents in Kent County face significant socioeconomic disparities compared to their White counterparts—they are three times more likely to be unemployed and the median household income for Black adults is roughly half what it is for Whites.   
o Kent County ranks high in the U.S. and Michigan for income inequality. The top $1\%$ in Kent County make 28.7 times more than the bottom $99\%$ .   
o Wealth and health: those who usually did not have enough money to make ends meet at the end of the month were more likely to rate their health as fair or poor, and more likely to report being stressed most or all of the time in the past 30 days.  

# COMMUNITY INPUT  

Key community-identified challenges related to economic security include:  

# Forces of Change: Economic Recession  

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with higher than average unemployment and plunging economic output, the country has officially entered an economic recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.2 Although there has been some recovery in economic activity, the preliminary unemployment rate for Kent County in December 2020 $(4.3\%)$ was still above the 2019 average of $2.9\%$ .  

# THREATS  

o Wealth disparities and “pockets of poverty” across Kent County   
o Not enough jobs that pay a livable wage   
o Stigma associated with low-income status   
o Lack of minority-owned businesses   
o Lack of investment in communities of color and low-income neighborhoods   
o Lack of opportunities to create generational wealth  

Some sectors are experiencing longer lengths of unemployment than others and some businesses have permanently closed.  

Differing abilities to work from home could worsen economic and health inequities.  

Increase in financial hardship and loss of benefits (such as retirement, health insurance, etc.) because of job loss.  

# OPPORTUNITIES  

The increase in unemployment wages (i.e., additional $\$600$ per week) during the pandemic brought attention to what is considered a “livable wage.”  

Impetus for new business innovation  

# Unemployment  

There is a strong relationship between employment status and mental and physical health. A stable, safe, and well-paying job makes it easier for people life in healthier neighborhoods, provide quality childcare and education for their families, afford nutritious food, and access health care—all critical factors to maintaining good health that are jeopardized by unemployment.1 Unemployment is also associated with an increase in unhealthy behaviors (such as alcohol and tobacco use, diet, and exercise), higher levels of depression, and strained relationships with family and friends.2  

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, average unemployment in Kent County has been steadily declining since 2010, with a low of $2.9\%$ in 2019 (Figure 7). After the statewide shutdown in late March 2020, unemployment peaked at $21.3\%$ (Figure 8). Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, people with disabilities, and those with lower educational attainment are more likely to be unemployed (Table 4).

During August and September 2020, when the unemployment rate was around $7\%$ , layoffs, reduced hours, pay cuts, uncertainty about job security, and business closures were some of the most frequently mentioned employment concerns and challenges survey respondents reported.  

The temporary increase in employment wages and stimulus check provided some short-term relief for those who lost their job; however, it is not sustainable for those who are still unemployed and struggling to make ends meet.  

# Income  

# WAGES  

In Kent County, $81.2\%$ of households have earnings from wage, salary, and/or selfemployment income. Average weekly wages in Kent County are $\$947$ , which is lower than Michigan (\$1,057) and the U.S. (\$1,139).1 The amount of a living wage depends on family size and cost-of-living. The current state minimum wage is $\$9.65$ per hour and the federal minimum wage is $\$7.25$ per hour; 2 however, many advocates and economists agree it should be raised to $\$15$ per hour. Higher wages improve living standards, provide greater workforce stability, reduce reliance on social safety-net services, and increase the tax base. Minimum-wage increases have shown to be manageable for businesses and beneficial for workers and the economy.3  

In the Grand Rapids-Wyoming Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), 18 of the 22 major occupational groups (accounting for $72.7\%$ of all employment in the area) have average hourly wages that are significantly lower than their respective national averages. None of the occupational groups have higher wages.†4

Five of the 22 major occupational groups have average hourly wages below $\$15$ per hour (compared to only two groups nationally with average wages below $\$15$ ). In the Grand Rapids-Wyoming MSA, these five groups account for $16.9\%$ of total employment.  

# INCOME INEQUALITY  

# THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY UNEQUAL.  

Economic hardship and its indicators tend to be distributed geographically, reflecting pockets of poverty and contrasting areas of concentrated wealth, often along racial and ethnic lines. Structural racism and unfair treatment historically built into institutions, policies, and practices—such as residential segregation in impoverished neighborhoods; discrimination in bank lending to residents of largely minority neighborhoods; and discriminatory policing and sentencing practices—continue to play a major role in wealth inequality between people of color and white people in the United States.5  

Out of 3,061 U.S. counties, Kent County ranks $100^{\mathrm{th}}$ for income inequality (and ranks $3^{\mathsf{r d}}$ out of all counties in Michigan). The top $1\%$ in Kent County make 28.7 times more than the bottom $99\%$

neighborhood. African American householders have a much lower median income than any other racial group in Kent County and roughly half that of White householders (Table 5). Although this same disparity is evident at the state and national level, the gap between African American and White householder incomes is larger in Kent County. Despite similar educational attainment, the median income for females (who worked full-time, year-round in the past 12 months)  

is $\$41,273$ while the median income for males is $\$52,531$ . The same disparity (by roughly the same amount) is also observed at the state and national level.1

# Ability to Meet Basic Needs  

Measuring a family’s ability to meet basic needs can provide a broader understanding of well-being than income-based poverty indicators alone.  

# ALICE  

Increased cost of living and minimal increases in wages means many people with steady employment still don’t earn enough through work to meet their basic needs. ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) households include those that have incomes above the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) but struggle to afford basic household necessities†. For a single adult, the basic cost of household necessities is $\$1,914$ per month, or $\$23,880$ per year— compared to the FPL income limit for a single adult, which is $\$12,140$ or below.2,3 For a family of four (two adults and two children) monthly household expenses range from $\$498$ to $\$5,382$ , depending on the age of children and childcare needs. The total annual budget for a family of four is $\$56,700$ to $\$68,808$ , while the FPL income limit for a household of this size is less than half of annual expenses (\$25,100).  

From 2010 to 2017, the total cost of basic household necessities increased by $26\%$ for a single adult and $27\%$ for a family of four.2 During that same time period, average hourly wages in Michigan increased by $18\%$ and in Kent County by $15\%$ .4  

In Kent County, $10\%$ of households are below the FPL and another $24\%$ are ALICE. However, there are significant geographic disparities within Kent County (Figure 9), with $47\%$ of households in Grand Rapids below the ALICE Threshold (poverty level and ALICE households combined) compared to only $11\%$ of households in Ada township and the city of East Grand Rapids.

# MATERIAL HARDSHIP  

Households that cannot afford to meet all their basic needs consistently often have to make difficult spending tradeoffs. For example, paying a utility bill instead of purchasing healthy foods. In Kent County, $24.2\%$ of adults experienced at least one material hardship in the past year. Those who did experience a material hardship were nearly four times more likely to report fair or poor health compared to those who did not experience a hardship.

# Economic Opportunity  

Parents’ wealth shapes their children’s educational, economic, and social opportunities, which in turn shape their children’s health throughout life. Both poor health and economic disadvantage can compound over a person’s lifetime and across generations. Challenges young children face today—and into adulthood—can reflect their parents’ lack of opportunities.1  

Children in Kent County who were raised at the bottom, middle, and top of the income distribution are likely to have very different incomes as adults. White adults who were raised in the lowest income families now make slightly more on average than Black adults who were raised in the highest income families (Figure 11).

# GENERAL FINANCES & DEBT  

Financial health—defined as ability to manage expenses, prepare for and recover from financial shocks, have minimal debt, and build wealth—is both a root cause and effect of various forms of economic insecurity (e.g., housing or food insecurity). 2 When most or all of a household’s budget is spent on necessities, unplanned expenses can result in debt and prospects for building wealth are diminished.  

“If you don't have your basic needs fulfilled, how are you going to start moving up?”  

– Focus group participant  

In Kent County, nearly $40\%$ of residents have just enough money or not enough at the end of the month to make ends meet. White adults and males are more likely to have some money left over at the end of the month compared to their Black, Hispanic, and female counterparts (Figure 12). Communities of color are twice as likely to have debt in collections than White communities (Figure 13). Higher rates of debt and less disposable income make it significantly harder to advance economic equity.

Credit can be a lifeline during emergencies and a bridge to education and homeownership. But debt, which can result from credit or unpaid bills, often burdens the financial well-being of families and communities.

differences in debt   
accumulation between   
communities of color and   
white communities, which   
can reinforce the wealth gap.  

# Education  

Level of education is an important indicator of social and economic status and a strong predictor of health outcomes. Higher educational attainment is associated with better jobs, higher earnings, increased health knowledge, better selfreported health and fewer chronic conditions.1  

# INDICATORS  

$0$ Early childhood education enrollment   
$0$ Percent of $3^{\mathsf{r d}}$ and $8^{t h}$ Grade students at or above proficiency for English and Math   
$0$ High school graduation rates   
$0$ Highest educational attainment among adults  

# KEY FINDINGS  

o Disparities in educational performance (i.e., $3^{\mathsf{r d}}$ and $8^{\mathrm{th}}$ Graders meeting proficiency standards) and high school graduation rates between school districts in Kent County reflect the socioeconomic disadvantages between communities and geographically align with poverty rates.   
o More than half of high school seniors are enrolled in college within six months of graduation.   
$0$ Educational attainment among adults is higher in Kent County than the state of Michigan.  

# COMMUNITY INPUT  

o Lack of activities for youth outside of school hours was a challenge identified through surveys and focus groups.   
o Disparities in educational quality between public schools in Kent County is another issue, and the potential for the learning gap to increase because of differences in educational settings (i.e., in-person or virtual) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “We have some educational problems, like there's a very clear divide   
between education opportunity for our children, and all children should   
have access to high quality learning. And that is not the case currently.”  

–Focus group participant  

# Forces of Change: Virtual Schooling  

Educational settings provide more than just learning and development for children and adolescents. It’s also a source of one or more daily meals for students in low-income families, a place to develop social skills and healthy relationships with peers and teachers, and a safe place to be outside and exercise, and a resource for mental health services.  

When school resumed in the Fall of 2020, students returned to either in-person, virtual, or hybrid learning settings; However, among Kent ISD public schools, student enrollment dropped by about 3,000 students in the Fall. Decreased Kindergarten enrollment and increase in home-schooling are likely two major factors in the decline.2  

# THREATS  

o Gaps in education and lost progress.   
o Reduced access to support, counseling, and other services provided by the school system.   
o Increased food insecurity among children   
o Lack of access to computers, webcams, and wireless internet leading to unequal educational opportunities.   
o Increased screen time for children.  

# OPPORTUNITIES  

o Increased independent learning skills.   
o Ability to learn from home without distractions of classroom environments may be a better learning model for some students.   
o Creation of effective hybrid learning models.  

# Early Childhood Education  

Early childhood education (ECE) can include childcare settings and early learning programs for children from birth to kindergarten. ECE helps children develop critical social, emotional, and cognitive skills that act as a foundation for future learning and school readiness. In Michigan, several state and federally funded programs are available specifically for low-income families and children who may be at a greater risk of educational or developmental delays. In Kent County, $22.4\%$ of children under age five are enrolled in an ECE program such as Great Start Readiness, Early Childhood Special Education, Early On, and Head Start. 1 In 2019, just under half $(47.1\%)$ of children age three to four were enrolled in preschool. 2  

# Education & COVID-19  

Among survey respondents, one of the top challenges related to the pandemic was navigating virtual schooling, particularly for parents who worked outside of the house during that time, parents who had children with special learning needs, and parents of young children. Both parents and teachers reported concerns of children falling behind due to lack of consistency between virtual and in-person learning from district to district, as well as the mental health impacts for students who are not getting enough social interaction, can’t play sports, or do routine activities associated with school settings.  

# 3rd and 8th Grade Proficiency  

Children who are not reading proficiently by the end of third grade are much less likely to graduate from high school. In Kent County, students who are economically disadvantaged, have a disability, or are Black or African American are much less likely to have test scores at or above proficiency in English and Math at both the third and eighth grade levels (Table 6).  

TABLE 6  

The school districts with the lowest percentage of $3^{\mathsf{r d}}$ and $8^{\mathrm{th}}$ Grade students at or above proficiency (Kelloggsville, Godfrey Lee, and Godwin Heights) correspond to areas of Kent County with some of the highest poverty rates. Conversely, school districts with the highest percentage of students at or above proficiency (Byron Center and East Grand Rapids, and Forest Hills) have the lowest poverty rates in Kent County.

# High School & College  

Since 2010, the high school graduation rate† in Kent County has increased from $74.5\%$ to $82.9\%$ in 2019.1 Among the 20 public school districts in Kent County, graduation rates vary from $76.2\%$ in Grand Rapids Public Schools (which is the largest public school district, with a cohort of 832 high school seniors in 2018-2019) to $96.7\%$ in Forest Hills Public Schools\* (second largest district with a cohort of 783) and East Grand Rapids Public Schools, both neighboring districts to GRPS.2  

More than half of students who graduated in the 2018-2019 school year were enrolled in a two- or four-year college or university within six months of graduating (Figure 14). For the adult population overall, two-thirds $(66.7\%)$ have some college education. Kent County has a higher percentage of adults with a bachelor’s degree or higher than the state of Michigan (Table 7).

# Community Identified Need: Youth Activities and Guidance  

The community is lacking in guidance, mentorship, and positive activities for youth, particularly teens, when they’re not in school. Cost was also noted as a barrier to participation in some youth programs.

# Housing  

Safe, stable, affordable housing was identified as a community need. Particularly among those who are low-income, aging adults, and those living in the Grand Rapids area.  

Stable housing is a foundation for successful education and employment and a necessity for achieving and maintaining good health. Substandard or unsafe housing increases the risk for unintentional injuries, asthma, lead poisoning, and poor childhood development. Housing costs can also be a significant source of stress and poor mental health.  

# INDICATORS  

$0$ Affordability: housing cost burden; change in costs over time $0$ Stability: home ownership and relocation o Quality and safety: substandard housing; lead exposure  

# KEY FINDINGS  

o Renters in Kent County are two times more likely to experience housing cost burden than homeowners.   
o Homeowners are disproportionately non-Hispanic White—Kent County has a higher percentage of homeowners who are non-Hispanic White $(87.3\%)$ than both Michigan $(85.6\%)$ and the US $(76.0\%)$ .   
o Hispanic/Latino households are seven times more likely to be overcrowded than White households.   
$0$ The percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in Kent County has been decreasing since 2010 and continues to do so; however, children living in the City of Grand Rapids are 4.5 times more likely to have EBLLs than children living in the rest of Kent County.  

# COMMUNITY INPUT  

o The most frequently mentioned housing issue is lack of affordable and adequate housing, particularly for renters and aging adults   
o Themes from community members include:   
Gentrification of Grand Rapids neighborhoods   
Increasing rent prices   
Rental process is burdensome, competitive, and expensive when having to apply for multiple rental units   
Racial inequities in home ownership   
“A lot of people who should be in assisted living or nursing cannot afford it, [so they]   
choose to be independent. And   
consequently, we find that when   
they get into a facility like this, where it's supposed to be   
independent, they're stunned to find out they don't have the help they need. They can't do   
the cooking, the cleaning, all of   
that kind of thing themselves.”  

—Focus group participant  

“It’s going to get increasingly less affordable to live here for people who live on a limited income.”  

—Focus group participant  

“In early stages of gentrification, and all of the issues that come with that, including income-disparity, the   
introduction of new luxury rental units, among long-ignored, sub-standard homes and rental properties. New local shops and stores that are very clearly intended for the 'new' white residents, and too expensive or   
impractical for the residents that have   
lived in the neighborhood for the last 10, 20, 30 years.”  

—Survey respondent describing community challenges  

# Affordability  

Housing is considered “affordable” when rental or ownership expenses are less than $30\%$ of income. Households experiencing housing cost burden (paying more than $30\%$ of income) and severe housing cost burden (paying more than $50\%$ of income), often have to make difficult trade-offs in meeting other basic needs.  

Nearly half of all renters in Kent County experience housing cost burden, and roughly one in four experience sever housing cost burden. Renters are 3.5 times more likely to be severely cost burdened than homeowners (Figure 15).

# CHANGE IN HOUSING COSTS  

In the past five years, median home value has increased more than median household income in Grand Rapids, Kent County, and Michigan (Figure 16). Median gross rent has increased by roughly $20\%$ in Grand Rapids and Kent County compared to about $10\%$ in Michigan. While the median rent in Grand Rapids is just slightly higher than in Kent County, the median income for Grand Rapids residents is approximately $30\%$ lower than the county average.

# Housing Stability  

High levels of homeownership are associated with more stable housing and more tightly knit communities. Owning a home over time can also be an indicator of economic security by allowing individuals and families to build savings for education or other opportunities that are important for health and future family wealth.1  

# HOMEOWNERSHIP  

The rate of homeownership in Kent County is $69.8\%$ . Homeownership in Kent County is slightly lower than the state of Michigan $(71.2\%)$ and significantly higher than in Grand Rapids, where nearly half of all housing is rented $(44.6\%)$ . Across Grand Rapids, Kent County, and Michigan, homeowners are disproportionately non-Hispanic White. In Kent County, nonHispanic Whites make up $87.3\%$ of all homeowners and $73.8\%$ of the population. In Grand Rapids, this gap is even larger, despite a higher proportion of non-White homeowners in the city $(21.6\%)$ , $78.4\%$ of homeowners are non-Hispanic White compared to just $59.0\%$ of the population. 2

An indicator of housing instability is moving frequently, which is associated with negative health outcomes in children and adolescents such as poor academic performance, behavioral problems, and increased risk of engaging in harmful health behaviors.3 In the past year, $3.5\%$ of Kent County adults moved two or more times. Young adults $(13.2\%)$ and those with lower educational attainment $(12.9\%)$ and low household income $(8.2\%)$ were significantly more likely to have moved frequently.  

# Quality and Safety  

# SUBSTANDARD AND OVERCROWDED HOUSING  

More than 2,300 occupied housing units in Kent County are considered “substandard” and lack full indoor plumbing or kitchens. Three out of four substandard housing units are renter-occupied.4  

Over 5,000 occupied housing units are also overcrowded $(2.2\%).$ , with more than one person per room. Hispanic and Latino households are more likely to be overcrowded $(10.2\%)$ compared to African American $(3.7\%)$ and White $(1.5\%)$ households.2  

# LEAD EXPOSURE  

One of the most common sources of lead exposure is from paint, dust, soil, and water in homes. There is an elevated risk for lead exposure in homes built before 1978, and the highest risk of exposure in homes built before 1950. Much of the housing in Kent County is relatively new construction with $42.0\%$ of homes built in 1980 or later. In contrast, homes in Grand Rapids are older, with $80.2\%$ built before 1980.2 There are typically no observable symptoms of lead exposure and even low levels are highly toxic, especially to young children and pregnant women. Elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) are greater than or equal to 4.5 micrograms per deciliter of blood. In Grand Rapids, $6.3\%$ of children under age six who were tested had EBLLs compared to only $1.4\%$ of children in the rest of Kent County. Overall, the proportion of children with EBLLs in Grand Rapids and Kent County has decreased since 2010.5  

# Community Voices  

“Healthy homes are   
the start to healthier neighborhoods.   
We can't stay in a position where we have lead poisoning in all these old   
homes and our children are   
suffering as a result of it. So   
[…] whatever we can do to   
build strong neighborhoods   
and provide healthy homes, then we’ll have greater   
collective impact that will   
have a greater lasting effect   
for generations to come.”  

– Focus group participant  

# Neighborhood & Built Environment  

The characteristics of the neighborhoods where we live and the built environment (i.e., human-made surroundings) can have major effects on our health and opportunities to be healthy. Health can be adversely affected by exposure to pollution, violence and crime, high density of convenience and liquor stores, and lack of access to healthy foods. Conversely, the presence of sidewalks and playgrounds, after-school programs for children, and affordable nutritious food encourage healthy behaviors and make it easier to achieve and maintain good health. Social and economic conditions in neighborhoods may improve health through access to employment opportunities and public resources including efficient transportation, an effective police force and good schools.  

Housing costs largely determine where people can afford to live, and growing income inequality has created concentrated areas of wealth and poverty. These neighborhood differences can create and reinforce social and economic disadvantages that contribute to health inequities along socioeconomic, racial or ethnic lines, due to disproportionate access to resources and exposures to conditions that are harmful to health. 1  

# INDICATORS  

o Community safety: crime and perceived safety o Infrastructure and community layout $0$ Transportation  

# KEY FINDINGS  

o The total number of crimes in Kent County has decreased since 2015 and is likely attributable (in part) to the legalization of marijuana in 2018.   
o Adults with lower household incomes are more likely to think their neighborhood is unsafe.   
o Black and Hispanic youth are twice as likely to miss school because they feel unsafe at school or on their way to/from school.   
o There are five times as many fast-food outlets in Kent County as grocery stores  

# COMMUNITY INPUT  

o Some survey respondents noted an increase in crime in their neighborhoods (such as car break-ins, theft, and gun violence); however, respondents also described poor community-police relations and lack of trust.   
o For rural residents, police response and proximity to emergency services was a challenge.   
o The public transportation system in the Urban Core (i.e., in and around Grand Rapids) was a strength noted by community members. Although, transportation was described as a challenge for those living outside of the city and for those without a personal vehicle.  

# “Being rural, emergency support (fire, police, ambulance, etc.) are all far away.”  

“Gunshots are frequent in the area, some petty crime, but nothing really happens to improve it because no one wants to call the police.”  

“Lack of transportation, I   
have to walk at least 3   
miles to get to the   
nearest bus stop.”

# Community Safety  

# CRIME  

High levels of violent crime compromise physical safety and psychological well-being. Exposure to crime and violence also increases stress, which may exacerbate hypertension and other stress-related disorders. Exposure to chronic stress, particularly among children, contributes to increased risk for certain chronic diseases.1  

There is a slightly lower violent crime rate in Kent County than the State average; however, the property crime rate in Kent County is about $12\%$ higher than in Michigan (Figure 17). Since 2015, the total number of annual offenses (that are reported) has decreased in Kent County by about $10\%$ . A reduction in property crimes was the main driver of this decrease—accounting for $52\%$ of the total reduction out of four crime categories. This is likely attributable to the statewide legalization of marijuana in November 2018, as the number of offenses for violation of a controlled substance was cut in half between 2018 and 2019.  

# PERCEIVED SAFETY  

Regardless of actual crime rates, feeling unsafe can compromise psychological well-being and be a deterrent to pursuing healthy behaviors, such as exercising outdoors. Overall, $4.1\%$ of youth and $5.0\%$ of adults consider their neighborhood unsafe. Those with lower household incomes are more likely to consider their neighborhood unsafe – particularly among the lowest income earners (i.e., a household income below $\$20,000$ per year), with $12.3\%$ believing their neighborhood is unsafe.2,3  

Among middle and high school-aged youth, $5.6\%$ reported feeling unsafe or very unsafe at school and $10.4\%$ did not go to school on one or more of the past 30 days because they felt unsafe. Middle schoolers were more likely to report missing school due to feeling unsafe $(15.1\%)$ compared to high schoolers $(7.5\%)$ . African American and Hispanic or Latino youth were almost twice as likely to miss school due to feeling unsafe than White students for both middle and high school ages.

# Infrastructure & Community Layout  

There are strong correlations between the density of grocery stores in an area and residents’ diets. Healthy and fresh food options that are affordable and in close proximity makes it easier to have a balanced and nutritious diet. In Kent County, there are five times as many fast-food outlets as grocery stores. 1 In 2015, $21.1\%$ of the population was considered to have low access to a grocery store $-5.3\%$ were low income and low access.2

# PARKS & GREENSPACES  

Almost half $(46\%)$ of residents live within half a mile of a park.  There are 42 parks, green spaces, and regional trails in Kent County totaling 7,354 acres. Approximately two-thirds of Kent County parks have accessible (i.e., barrier-free) accommodations of some sort. 5 The City of Grand Rapids has an additional 82 parks and green spaces. 6  

# Community Identified Need: Safe Sidewalks & Improved Walkability  

Nearly a quarter of survey respondents $(23.4\%)$ do not think sidewalks are accessible where they live. The lack of safe, properly maintained sidewalks— particularly in high-traffic or high-speed areas—is dangerous for pedestrians and can be a deterrent to physical activity or spending time outdoors.  

“We need better sidewalks. I take my grandma on walks in her wheelchair, sometimes I have to enter the road because the sidewalks concrete is buckled.” – Community survey respondent  

# TRANSPORTATION  

In areas with low walkability, lack of transportation can be a barrier for accessing needed services and resources. In Kent County, $6.9\%$ of households do not have a vehicle. Among renter-occupied households, $17.5\%$ do not have a vehicle. The majority of workers in Kent County commute. The average commute time is 21 minutes, but $3.6\%$ of commuters drive more than 60 minutes to work. 3  

Overall, the public transportation system is accessible within the Grand Rapids area. However, for those who live outside of the city and who do not have a personal vehicle, transportation options are extremely limited. African Americans are more likely to use public transportation as a means of getting to work $(5.6\%)$ than Hispanic or Latino $(3.4\%)$ and non-Hispanic White $(1.1\%)$ residents. 4  

# “Lack of sidewalks and road shoulders for running and biking safely.”  

– Community survey respondent  

“28th Street creates a barrier to going out   
and about beyond immediate neighborhood. Other busy streets such as Eastern and   
Burton are harder to cross than they should   
be because crosswalks are not marked, are poorly marked, or are not observed by   
motorists. Busy streets are too wide or traffic too fast to be pedestrian friendly.”  

– Community survey respondent  

# Social and Community Context  

The quality of living, working, learning, and playing are influenced by inclusion and belonging. When a population or community belongs—in other words, is not marginalized or excluded—it means their voices are heard and they have a say in shaping the conditions in the community that affect their lives and health. Belonging and inclusion affect relationships and how we interact with others, access to resources, resilience, and opportunities for educational and economic success.1  

# INDICATORS  

o Community cohesion and belonging o Social support o Racism and discrimination  

# KEY FINDINGS  

o Just over half of Kent County households are individuals who live alone. More than a third of adults who live alone are age 65 or older.   
o More than one in ten African American $(13.1\%)$ and Hispanic or Latinos $(11.1\%)$ experienced racial discrimination in the workplace or when seeking health care in the past 12 months.  

# COMMUNITY INPUT  

o The community is not welcoming for people of color and they do not have the same experiences or sense of belonging as white residents.   
o West Michigan is a place where social connections are important for accessing opportunities and resources. If you don’t already have those connections, they can be difficult to form here.  

# Community Cohesion  

A sense of belonging and overall community cohesion were identified as something that’s important to health. However, many described the community as segregated and lacking diversity. A major theme that emerged from community input was that many people of color do not share the same experiences or sense of belonging as white people living in Kent County.  

# Community Conversations: Dialogue between two focus group participants  

“I can be anywhere in 15 or 20 minutes from where I live. I can be at the airport, I can be out in the woods on a trail, I can be at the lakeshore, yet I can find plenty of things to do in town, plenty of great restaurants […], we've got a symphony, we've got places like Meijer Gardens, we've got St. Cecilia's and so many clubs and just a lot to do.”  

“As a Mexican immigrant, it just affects me to   
see my own community […] the best way I can describe it, it’s two separate worlds, very   
separate. And I think that somebody can say, “I   
love this place” like [participant 1 said]. And it's true. It's true. But somebody can say “this place sucks for me or my family, I don't have   
the same opportunities, I'm not treated right.” And that is also true.”

Some community members described Kent County as welcoming and inviting, while others found it to be less inclusive. Black and Hispanic residents were about three times more likely to disagree that their community is welcoming and positive for them (Figure 19).  

“Very few are welcoming and friendly. Especially to people of color.”  

“Downtown is just growing   
and growing and growing.   
A lot of it's geared to bring us down and come play and enjoy the new amenities, the people,   
because they're all walking around downtown. So, I think it's a pretty inviting city.”

# Social Support  

Social connection and support are a determinant of health and can be an important factor in coping with stress and long-term resiliency. Social networks, whether formal (such as a faith-based group or social club), or informal (such as meeting with friends) provide a sense of belonging, security, and community.  

Different types of social support include: 1  

o Emotional support, or making someone else feel cared for   
o Instrumental or tangible support, such as money or helping with tasks   
o Informational support  

# 1 in 10  

survey respondents did not have people they could rely on for help when needed  

# “Social capital is important here. It’s very much who you are and who you know.”  

–Focus group participant  

According to residents who provided community input for the CHNA, social connections are an important asset in West Michigan for accessing information, resources, and opportunities—however, these connections can be hard to establish for some. A lack of systematic communication to the general public about existing resources and how to access them leads many to rely on informal networks, such as faith-based communities, for information on available resources. However, these connections can be hard to establish for some, and without those social connections or larger networks, they do not have access to the same resources.  

“Accessibility and promotion of   
resources seems to be exclusive   
information, lack of knowing how to connect to community/neighborhood.”  

–Survey respondent describing community challenges  

People who live alone make up over half of all households in Kent County (Figure 20).  

FIGURE 20  

Adults living alone

Females over age 65 are 2.5 times more likely to live alone than males over age 65.  

# Social Support & COVID-19  

Older adults and those who live alone experienced reduced social support and challenges such as lack of physical, inperson contact and increased feelings of loneliness and isolation because of the pandemic. Some also noted that providing support to loved ones was difficult— particularly for older adults or those who are high-risk—due to fear of exposing them to COVID-19.

# Discrimination & Racism  

Discrimination is the unfair or prejudicial treatment of people and groups based on characteristics such as race (racism), gender, age, ability, or sexual orientation.1 Discrimination is a social stressor that has physiological effects such as sleep difficulties, anxiety, and hypertension. Not all discrimination is conscious, intentional, or personal. It’s often built into institutional policies and practices that unfairly advantage some and disadvantage others. 2 , 3  This systematic disadvantage coupled with chronic and compounding stress are driving forces of social determinants of health and inequities in health outcomes.  

# Community Input: Discrimination  

“There are many times that I actually do not have procedures done because they cannot accommodate me […] They can't get me on an exam table, or I can't get into a building, or whatever the situation may be.”  

People who have a disability and who identify as LGBTQ were more   
likely to report that discrimination is a frequent or constant source of   
stress for them compared to those with no disability and straight/ cisgender survey respondents.  

In focus groups, participants also reported facing additional barriers to health care because of these characteristics.  

“What we don't want is to be passing over certain things that you would suggest to an able bodied person and then say, ‘Well, that would be really difficult, so I'm not even going to bring that up to somebody who has a physical disability.’”  

–Conversation between focus group participants “There's a lot of these different obstacles put in place for trans people when we're just trying to live. We just want health care. We just want to get the same care as everybody else. We're not trying to hack the system or anything. We're just trying to get health care.”  

–Focus group participant

# Technology  

Internet access is an important social determinant of health and resource for work, education, and communication. It has been especially crucial during the current COVID-19 pandemic as many employers and educators transitioned to remote work and learning. High speed internet (i.e., broadband) also plays a role in accessing healthcare via telehealth, which has become increasingly common due to the pandemic. Common barriers to high speed internet access include cost and deficient infrastructure.1  

In Kent County, $86.3\%$ of households have a broadband internet subscription and $11\%$ do not have household internet access. Of those with a broadband internet subscription, $10\%$ rely on a cell phone data plan as their source for internet.

Common barriers to high speed internet access include cost and deficient infrastructure. Those with household incomes below $\$50,000$ are about $20\%$ less likely to have a broadband internet subscription $(73.9\%)$ compared to those with a household income above $\$50,000$ $(94.4\%)$ .2 Areas of the county where internet service gaps persist include: Townships of Tyrone, Sparta, Grattan, Vergennes, Lowell, Bowne, Gaines, Caledonia, Byron, Cascade, Algoma, and Ada.3  

Age and knowledge of technology use are additional factors to consider with internet accessibility. Older adults in Kent County are less likely to have a computer device (such as a desktop, laptop, smartphone, or tablet) and less likely to have broadband internet. Among those age 65 and older, $17.9\%$ of households do not have a computer device compared to those age 64 and younger— $1.9\%$ of which do not have a computer device in their household.2  

# Technology & COVID-19  

# Technology was central to many of the things listed as helpful or providing relief.  

o Maintaining social connections and community networks while remaining physically distant (through video chat, live streamed religious services, group support meetings, etc.)   
o Accessing health care services virtually – this was most notable for mental health services and virtual counseling   
o “Very slow and sporadic” internet connectivity in rural areas was a challenge for staying connected with others and working virtually.   
o Others reported the cost of high-speed internet and new technology as significant challenges for working or learning virtually.

# Health Status  

General health status is a reliable self-rated assessment of one’s perceived health status, which may be influenced by all aspects of life, including behaviors, environmental factors, and community. Self-rated general health status is useful in determining unmet health needs, identifying disparities among subpopulations, and characterizing the burden of disease and overall well-being within a population.1  

Overall, $12.0\%$ of adults in Kent County reported that their health, in general, was fair or poor.  

# DISPARITIES IN SELF-RATED POOR HEALTH  

# RACE  

Black adults are twice as likely as their White counterparts to report fair or poor health (Figure 22)  

# INCOME  

Those with a household income below $\$50,000$ are about seven times more likely to report fair or poor health than those with a household income above \$50,000 (Figure 22)  

# AGE  

Younger adults are more likely to report experiencing frequent mental health problems than older adults—whereas older adults are more likely to report experiencing frequent physical health problems than younger adults (Figure 23).  

# ABILITY  

People with a disability are more likely to report fair or poor overall health, poor physical, and poor mental health than people with no disabilities.  

# SEXUAL ORIENTATION & GENDER IDENTITY  

LGBTQ adults are two to three times more likely to report poor physical and mental health, respectively than straight or cisgender adults (figure 23).

# Self-Reported Health & COVID-19  

According to community survey respondents, physical health mostly stayed the same while mental health worsened.  

How does your physical/mental health now compare to before the COVID-19 pandemic?  

65% said their physical health stayed the same and $46\%$ said their mental health stayed the same $24\%$ said their physical health worsened and $\cdot$ said their mental health worsened $12\%$ said their physical health improved and $7\%$ said their mental health improved  

# Life Expectancy  

In Kent County, average life expectancy is 79.9 years overall.  Average life expectancy is lower for American Indian/Alaskan Native (74.8) and African American (74.9) residents compared to White (80.3), Hispanic (85.1), and Asian (91.9) residents.1  

# Leading Causes of Death  

Kent County has lower mortality rates for almost all leading causes of death compared to Michigan and the U.S.  

Alzheimer’s disease is the notable exception, with 48.6 deaths per 100,000 people in Kent County and only 34.3 and 31.0 in Michigan and the U.S., respectively (Table 9).

# Chronic Disease  

Chronic diseases include conditions that last one year or more. They are the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S. and a driver of high annual healthcare costs. According to the CDC, six in 10 adults have a chronic disease and four in 10 have two or more. Chronic conditions may require ongoing medical attention and often negatively impact quality of life, especially if left undiagnosed or unmanaged. Although they are common and costly, many chronic diseases can be prevented or managed through simple lifestyle changes. The four lifestyle risk factors that increase risk for chronic conditions include:1  

$0$ Tobacco use $0$ Poor nutrition $0$ Lack of physical activity $0$ Excessive alcohol use  

Non-modifiable risk factors such as age, sex, and family history, as well as the physical, economic, and social environment also have significant impacts on disease occurrence and outcomes. In Kent County, there are consistent racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in risk factor prevalence, access to health care, and use of preventive services which contributes to inequities in chronic disease morbidity and mortality.  

# INDICATORS  

The following chronic conditions were selected as indicators of population health status in Kent County based on whether they were identified as a top health need through community input, or are among the leading causes of death, disability, or hospitalizations.  

$0$ Arthritis   
o Asthma   
o Cancer   
o Chronic Pain   
o Diabetes   
o Heart Disease & Stroke   
$0$ Obesity  

# Arthritis  

Arthritis is a general term for more than 100 different conditions (including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, and fibromyalgia) that result in inflammation or swelling of the joints. Arthritis can cause stiffness and severe, chronic joint pain. It’s a leading cause of disability in the U.S., affecting both work and daily living activities.1 The prevalence is expected to increase as the population ages.2  

# PREVALENCE  

o Nearly one in four adults $(23.1\%)$ of adults in Kent County have been diagnosed with some form of arthritis.   
o Prevalence increases with age – half of adults age 65 and older have been diagnosed with arthritis.  

# SEVERITY  

o A quarter of adults $(26.4\%)$ diagnosed with arthritis experience work limitations and more than a third $(37.5\%)$ experience activity limitations due to arthritis. o Among those who have been diagnosed with arthritis, $88.1\%$ reported having joint pain during the past 30 days.  

# DISPARITIES  

o Females are more likely to have arthritis $(27.0\%)$ compared to males $(18.9\%)$ ). Females are also more likely to report arthritis-attributable work and activity limitations.   
$0$ Adults age 35-44 are less likely to have arthritis $(14.3\%)$ than older age groups, but more likely to experience work and activity limitations ( $42.6\%$ and $55.6\%,$ respectively) due to arthritis.   
o Those with less than a high school education are significantly more likely to report joint pain in the past 30 days than those with some college or higher.  

# DISEASE MANAGEMENT  

o Only $19.8\%$ of adults with arthritis have taken an educational course or class to learn how to manage problems or symptoms related to arthritis. Females are significantly more likely to have received education on arthritis management than males.   
o Most adults have had a doctor or health professional suggest physical activity or exercise to help with arthritis symptoms $(73.8\%)$ ; $22.1\%$ of adults with arthritis have not received this advice.  

# Asthma  

Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the lungs and can cause episodes of wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can range in severity from mild to life threatening. Asthma attacks can be triggered by a variety of indoor and outdoor exposures such as tobacco smoke, outdoor air pollution, cold weather, exercise, stress, dust mites, pets, and mold. Asthma is the most chronic condition among children. Living environments, particularly substandard or overcrowded housing can increase the risk of developing asthma and cause more severe asthma—which is why children in low-income families are disproportionately burdened by this condition.1  

# HOSPITALIZATIONS  

o Asthma was the sixth leading cause of preventable hospitalizations in 2018, with 5.4 hospitalizations per 10,000 people. 2   
o Almost half $(46.7\%)$ of all asthma-related hospitalizations in 2018 were among children younger than 18 (asthma is the second leading cause of preventable hospitalizations among children in Kent County, with 10.3 hospitalizations per 10,000 children).  

# PREVALENCE  

o $8.8\%$ of middle and high school-age youth in Kent County reported currently having asthma. There is little difference between Black, Hispanic/Latino, and White students for asthma prevalence rates (i.e., those who have ever had asthma), however Black children are more likely to currently have asthma than Hispanic/Latino and White children.3   
o $16.8\%$ of adults have ever had asthma, and $10.4\%$ of adults currently have asthma.4  

# TRENDS  

o Adult asthma rates in Kent County have been increasing over the past 20 years. The largest spike in asthma prevalence (those who have ever had asthma) occurred in the past three years—increasing from $12.1\%$ to $16.8\%$ and surpassing the state $(16.4\%)$ and national $(14.9\%)$ prevalence rates.   
o The percentage of those who currently have asthma increased from $7.3\%$ in 2017 to $10.4\%$ in 2020.  

# DISPARITIES  

o Higher asthma prevalence is associated with lower household income and younger age groups. Females $(13.3\%)$ and non-Hispanic adults $(11.0\%)$ also have a higher prevalence than males $(7.4\%)$ and Hispanic or Latino adults $(5.8\%)$ .  

# Cancer  

Cancer is the second leading cause of death after heart disease in Kent County, Michigan, and the U.S. The biggest risk factor for cancer is age. Half of all new cancer diagnoses occur in adults age 65 and older. Other risk factors for cancer include tobacco use, obesity, exposure to ultraviolet light, environmental carcinogens, and family history. Getting routine recommended screenings such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and prostate exams can improve outcomes by detecting and treating cancer in its earlier stages. 1

The age-adjusted death rate for all three types of cancer is lower in Kent County than Michigan and the U.S.  

Breast cancer is the most common type, followed by prostate and lung cancer; however, lung cancer kills more people on average than breast and prostate cancer combined. Racial, ethnic, and gender disparities exist in incidence and mortality rates and are often linked to social determinants of health including education, economic status, and access to health care.  

African Americans are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than Whites.  

Black males are 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2.5 times more likely to die of prostate cancer than non-Hispanic White males.  

Non-Hispanic White females are slightly more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than Black females, however Black females are more likely to receive a late stage diagnosis and more likely to die from breast cancer than White females.  

# Chronic Pain  

Chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts for three months or more but can sometimes last for years. It’s one of the most common reasons people seek medical care and has a significant impact on overall well-being. Chronic pain is linked to restrictions in mobility and daily activities, anxiety, depression, poor perceived health, reduced quality of life, and several other health conditions including arthritis, cancer, and back pain.1,2  

Both non-opioid and opioid medications are used to treat chronic pain. People who take opioids are at risk for many adverse effects, including opioid misuse. Improving opioid prescribing practices, increasing the use of non-opioid medications, and managing chronic pain with physical therapy can all help reduce opioid misuse—one of the major public health challenges associated with chronic pain amid the opioid pandemic.3  

o State-wide, $37\%$ of Michigan residents have experienced chronic pain in the past year that limits their lives or work–most of whom (four out of five) had pain on some or most days4 Only one in five people with chronic pain were prescribed pain medication   
o The opioid prescribing rate in Kent County has decreased; from a peak of 90.2 prescriptions per 100 persons in 2012 to 67.7 prescriptions per 100 persons in 2018.5

# Diabetes  

Diabetes occurs when the body cannot produce or respond appropriately to insulin, resulting in high blood glucose levels. The three major types of diabetes include Type 1, Type 2, and Gestational. Type 2 diabetes, also referred to as adult onset diabetes, accounts for $90\text{\textperthousand}$ of all cases. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, unlike Type 1 which is caused by an autoimmune reaction and not known to be preventable. Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and usually goes away after birth but can be a risk factor for childhood obesity and for developing Type 2 diabetes later in life (for both the mother and child).  

Prediabetes, or borderline diabetes occurs when blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as Type 2 diabetes. It is a risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes as well as heart disease and stroke. Prediabetes is reversable, however, there may not be any symptoms and many adults don’t know they have it, so blood sugar tests and healthy lifestyle habits are key to prevention.1  

# HOSPITALIZATIONS  

o Diabetes is the ninth leading cause of death in Kent County and the leading cause for preventable hospitalizations.2   
o $15.4\%$ of all preventable hospitalizations in 2018 were for diabetes   
$0$ In 2018, the hospitalization rate for diabetes was twice the annual average from 2012-2016 (14.2 per 10,000 annual average from 2012-2016, and 28.8 per 10,000 in 2018).  

# PREVALENCE  

The prevalence of adults diagnosed with diabetes has decreased for the first time since 2008, compared to state and national diagnoses which have slowly increased.  

FIGURE 28  

# THE LARGEST DISPARITIES FOR BOTH DIABETES AND PREDIABETES ARE SEEN IN AGE, RACE, AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME.  

Trends in diabetes prevalence  

Local, state, and national diabetes prevalence, 2002-2020  

One in four adults over 65 have diabetes.  

African American adults are roughly two times as likely to have diabetes and prediabetes $15.9\%$ and $17.4\%$ than White adults $7.6\%$ and $9.1\%\$ ). African Americans are also more likely to have had a diabetes test within the past 3 years $(61.4\%)$ compared to White $(45.5\%)$ and Hispanic $(47.5\%)$ adults.

The rate of diabetes and prediabetes decreases as household income increases.  

# Heart Disease and Stroke  

Heart disease and stroke are both cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect blood flow to the heart and brain. In 2018, $30\%$ of all deaths in Kent County were attributable to heart disease and stroke and there are significant disparities in CVD mortality rates based on sex and race (Figure 29). Many of the risk factors associated with CVD are modifiable and addressing them early in life can prevent disease and disability related to CVD. Key risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cigarette smoking. Nearly half of Americans $(47\%)$ have at least one of these three risk factors. Other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also increase the risk for heart disease and stroke, including diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use:1

# RISK FACTOR PREVALENCE  

$0$ One in four adults in reported no physical activity in the past 30 days   
$0$ Almost two in three $(62.5\%)$ adults are overweight or obese   
o $13.5\%$ of adults currently smoke cigarettes   
$0$ one in three have high blood pressure   
$0$ one in four have high cholesterol  

# DISPARITIES IN HYPERTENSIONAND CHOLESTEROL AMONG KENTCOUNTY ADULTS  

# RACE  

Nearly half of all Black adults have high blood pressure, compared to one-third of White adults.  

# ETHNICITY  

Hispanic and Latino adults are more than twice as likely not to have had their cholesterol checked within the past five years.  

# INCOME  

Rates of hypertension are correlated with socioeconomic status (higher rates among those with lower educational attainment and household income). Cholesterol, however, is more evenly distributed with similar rates across socioeconomic groups.  

# AGE  

Both hypertension and high cholesterol prevalence increase with age. Among adults age 65 and older, $61.8\%$ have high blood pressure and $45.3\%$ have high cholesterol.  

# SEX  

Despite similar prevalence of high blood pressure among males $(29.7\%)$ and females $(28.8\%)$ , females were significantly more likely to be currently taking medication $(80.6\%)$ for high blood pressure than males $(71.1\%)$ .  

# HYPERTENSION & CHOLESTEROL  

Hypertension (high blood pressure) and high cholesterol are both risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Nearly a third $(29.2\%)$ of all adults in Kent County were told by a doctor that they have high blood pressure, and a quarter $(25.7\%)$ have been told they have had high cholesterol. The American Heart Association recommends that adults have their cholesterol checked with a blood test every four to six years. In Kent County, only $10.3\%$ of adults reported not having their cholesterol checked in the past five years. For hypertension management, about three quarters of adults who have had high blood pressure are currently taking medication.  

# Obesity  

Obesity is a complex condition and a major risk factor for other preventable chronic diseases and leading causes of death including heart disease, stroke, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Obesity and being overweight are also associated with other serious health conditions like osteoarthritis, breathing problems, sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety.  

The fundamental cause of obesity is poor diet and physical inactivity, however dietary and physical activity patterns are often determined by environmental and societal factors and reflect the lack of supportive policies in sectors such as health, transportation, urban planning, food processing, marketing, and education. 1

Obesity rates continue to rise in Michigan and the U.S.  

In Kent County, adult obesity rates have decreased slightly from a high of $32.0\%$ in 2017 to $30.8\%$ in 2020.  

Obesity rates among middle and high school-age youth in Kent County have increased—from $9.7\%$ and $11.4\%,$ , respectively, in the 2013-2014 school year to $15.8\%$ and $14.9\%$ in the 2019- 2020 school year.2 Youth obesity has increased at a faster rate than adult obesity in the same period.  

# Maternal and Infant Health  

Pregnancy, childbirth, and the first years of life are a determinant of health. A mother’s health-related behaviors as well as mental, physical, and socioeconomic well-being—before, during, and after pregnancy—can affect cognitive and physical development in infancy, and impact long-term outcomes into childhood and adulthood.1

In Kent County, women who reported smoking while pregnant was about half the average for the state of Michigan. Pregnant women in Kent County are also more likely to plan on breast feeding after birth, however the breast-feeding initiation rate is lower than the state average (Table 12).  

# Notes:

# LOW BIRTHWEIGHT  

Birthweight is a significant predictor for infant health. Low birthweight infants (weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth) have the highest risk of infant mortality. There are also short- and long-term health complications associated with low birthweight including breathing and heart problems during infancy, and Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and developmental delays during child and adulthood.  

Black mothers in Kent County are about twice as likely to have infants born with low birthweight than White mothers, and about three times more likely to have infants born with very low birthweight (Figure 31).

# INFANT MORTALITY  

Infant mortality rate (IMR) is defined as the number of deaths of children before one year of age. It is an important measure of community health because it reflects the health of the mother and infant during pregnancy and the year thereafter. Factors impacting maternal and infant health—and IMR—include access to prenatal care, prevalence of prenatal health behaviors (such as alcohol or tobacco use and proper nutrition during pregnancy), postnatal care and behaviors (such as childhood immunizations and nutrition), sanitation, and infection control.1 Persistent racial disparities in IMR are also indicative of health and socioeconomic inequities within communities. In Kent County the African American IMR is roughly twice that of the non-Hispanic White IMR. This disparity is also observed at the national level.

# Mental Health  

Mental health is a state of emotional, psychological, and social well-being resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with challenges. Mental illness refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders, or health conditions that significantly affect mood, emotion, thinking or behavior, and often impact day-to-day living or ability to function. Examples of mental illnesses include depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder.1 As with many diseases, mental illness can be mild or severe. There are multiple factors that contribute to poor mental health and mental illness. Genetics, environment, and lifestyle often influence whether someone develops a mental health condition and things like stress and traumatic life events make some people more susceptible.2  

Mental health and physical health are closely connected. Mental health plays a major role in people’s ability to maintain good physical health. People, including children and adolescents, with untreated mental health disorders are at high risk for many unhealthy and unsafe behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse, violent or self-destructive behavior, and suicide. Mental illness also increases the risk for many chronic health conditions including diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart disease, and cancer.3 Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.  

# INDICATORS  

o Self-reported poor mental health days per month   
o Diagnosed depression   
o Stress   
$0$ Disability due to mental health condition   
$0$ Percent of adults receiving mental health treatment  

# KEY FINDINGS  

o There are persistent disparities in poor mental health based on age, sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, disability status, race, and household income. Groups who consistently report higher rates of poor mental health, diagnosed depression, and stress include:  

Younger adults (age 18-24)   
Females   
LGBTQ adults   
People who have one or more disability   
Non-Hispanic/White adults   
Those with a lower household income  

o $14.3\%$ of adults experienced work or activity limitations in the past 30 days due to a mental health condition o $37\%$ are not currently receiving mental health treatment  

# COMMUNITY INPUT  

o Stress and mental health were the two most frequently selected factors that have the greatest impact on health and well-being.   
o Access to mental health care remains a top need in the community and the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health across all ages.   
o Limited options for mental health care for adolescents, especially during times of crisis  

# Mental Health & COVID-19  

When asked about the greatest challenges individuals and households experienced due to the pandemic, nearly every theme identified tied back to mental health.  

Survey respondents frequently mentioned feelings of stress, anxiety, fear, uncertainty, hopelessness, helplessness, frustration, and emotional exhaustion.  

Many described experiencing new stressors such as job loss, risk of exposure to COVID-19, and navigating virtual learning with children; and trying to manage or cope with existing stressors that were exacerbated by the pandemic like financial stability, isolation, and parenting or caregiving.  

Secondary stress—also referred to as compassion fatigue—is a by-product of working with or caring for someone else who is experiencing significant stress or trauma. Many comments from survey respondents described their own mental health challenges because of what others are going through.  

Access to mental health care is critical for maintaining good mental health and managing and treating mental illness, especially during times of extreme stress. Many noted the importance of being able to continue or begin mental health treatment (e.g., virtual counseling or therapy, obtaining necessary prescriptions, etc.) and how impactful it has been for their overall well-being. However, not all who wanted or needed mental health care could get it.  

One in five survey respondents were unable to access needed mental health care and the number one barrier was high cost of services.  

“Borrowing other people’s stress. Coping when other people are angry, stressed out, etc. and are looking for support when we have a limited capacity to give.”  

“Dealing with depression and anxiety. My Husband and I are both front line and essential workers, so we had trauma and anxiety surrounding work.  

# “Watching my child experience depression and anxiety”  

“We were challenged because many of our loved ones could not make rent payments and were   
stressed about being able to survive   
the pandemic as they were forced   
to work in conditions that exposed them to the virus.”  

# Self-Reported Poor Mental Health  

In Kent County, one in seven adults reported 14 or more days of poor mental health in the past 30 days—a similar rate to that of the U.S. and slightly lower than Michigan (see Figure 23). Young adults are six times more likely to report 14 or more poor mental health days than older adults. From 2017 to 2020, young adults were the only age group to experience a significant increase in poor self-rated mental health, from $17.7\%$ to $31.2\%$ . Household income is also associated with self-reported poor mental health. Those with lower household incomes are 5 times more likely than those with higher household incomes to report 14 or more days of poor mental health, and the likelihood decreases as household income increases. LGBTQ adults and those with a disability are also more likely to have 14 or more days of poor mental health—with rates three times higher than their straight or cisgender and able-bodied counterparts.  

# Diagnosed Depression  

Diagnosed depression is more common in Kent County compared to Michigan and the U.S. (Figure 33). Rates of diagnosed depression are highest among LGBTQ adults, people with disabilities, young adults, females, and White residents. There is also a relationship between depression and household income. The likelihood of being diagnosed with depression decreases as household income increases— those with a household income of less than $\$35,000$ a year are twice as likely to have a depressive disorder than those with a household income above $\$75,000$ .

# Stress  

Stress affects everyone from time to time, but experiencing persistent, daily stress puts continued strain on the body and overwhelms the physiological systems designed to mitigate stress. The compounding effects of chronic stress leads to an increased risk of health problems such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and depression.1  

People with greater socioeconomic advantage (e.g., with more education, higher incomes and/or greater wealth) may be more likely to experience stress in ways that have beneficial effects on their health, like being able to adapt to changes and cope with challenges. Conversely, those with less education and lower incomes typically face more frequent and numerous stressors in many aspects of their lives, while at the same time having more limited social and material resources for coping.2  

One in 10 adults in Kent County reported being stressed all or most of the time during the past 30 days. High rates of stress are reported most frequently among those who are LGBTQ or have a disability. The likelihood of being stressed all or most of the time is inversely proportional to both age and income, with younger and lower income groups reporting stress more often than their counterparts (Figure 34).

# Disability  

Mental health-related disability reflects the percentage of adults who had a mental health or emotional problem that kept them from doing work or other activities during the past 30 days. This can be an indicator of the severity of mental health conditions in a population.  

In Kent County, $14.3\%$ of adults experienced work or activity limitations in the past 30 days due to a mental health condition and more than one third of those who did are not receiving any mental health treatment $(37.2\%)$ . Among adults who reported 14 or more days of poor mental health, $43.5\%$ experienced work or activity limitations as a result of poor mental health.  

# Young Adults and Adolescents  

Young adults (age 18-24) reported higher rates of poor mental health, diagnosed depression, and work or activity limitations due to mental health than any other age group. When asked about specific symptoms, they most commonly experienced feelings of nervousness, restlessness, and like everything was an effort (Figure 36). In Kent County, adults age 18-29 accounted for $30\%$ of all suicides in 2020.1  

Youth with poor mental health may struggle with school and grades, decision making, and their overall health. Mental health problems in adolescence are often coupled with other health and behavioral risks such as increased risk of drug use, experiencing violence, and higher risk sexual behaviors.2  

One in three middle schoolers and one in five high schoolers have been bullied at school in the past year. Female middle schoolers are two times more likely to be cyberbullied than their male counterparts (Figure 37).

$23.7\%$ of middle school students and $31.4\%$ of high school students had persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year.  

$17.4\%$ of middle school students and $15.4\%$ of high school students have seriously considered attempting suicide.  

Females and Hispanic youth experienced higher rates of sadness, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation.  

# Treatment  

Mental health conditions can be treated or successfully managed. In Kent County, high cost of services, lack of access to appropriate services (e.g., crisis services for adolescents), insurance navigation, and stigma have all been identified as barriers to mental health care.  

There are two psychiatric hospitals in Kent County, with a total of 306 beds. Roughly one in five beds are available for patients under 18.1 In 2018, the hospitalization rate for affective disorders (i.e., mood disorders—depression and bipolar disorder are the most common) was 6.7 hospitalizations per 10,000 people, with an average length of stay of 5.8 days. Males accounted for just over half $(54.6\%)$ of hospitalizations. Young adults (age 18-24) had a higher hospitalization rate for mood disorders, with 10.9 per 10,000.2  

# Community Input  

According to community survey respondents who were unable to access mental health care in the past year, the top barrier was high cost of services.  

# Of adults who reported 14 or more days of poor mental health, 40.1% are not currently receiving any treatment.  

In Kent County, those who have higher rates of poor mental health (LGBTQ, disabled, young adults, females, White, and lower income) all have significantly higher rates of treatment (i.e., currently taking medication or receiving other treatment for a mental health condition) – with the exception of household income (the lowest household income earners have slightly higher rates of treatment, $25.9\%,$ compared to the highest income earners, $17.9\%,$ but the difference is not significant).  

# STIGMA  

Most adults $(89.8\%)$ agreed that treatment can help people with mental illness lead normal lives. Just over half of adults in Kent County $(53.6\%)$ ) agree that people are generally caring and sympathetic to people with mental illness, and about one in three $(35.1\%)$ disagree.  

# Community Input  

“I don't want any kind of mental health labels like "depression" or "anxiety" or the anything else left in my permanent medical record. You never know what can happen with those labels down the road.  

So even if that's what's happening, I'm not telling them.”

# Health Behaviors  

The following are considered “modifiable” (i.e., controllable) risk factors for disease. However, health-related behaviors are not always a matter of personal decisions and lifestyle choices. They are often a reflection of larger societal factors such as environment, education, and economic resources, that individuals cannot always control or modify. In Kent County, there are clear patterns across most of the health behavior indicators based on age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (education and income).  

Healthy behaviors have been shown to reduce premature mortality (i.e., early death), and a number of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Individuals who engage in unhealthy behavior may also be more likely to have multiple unhealthy habits. For example, adults and adolescents who smoke, don’t get enough sleep, don’t get enough exercise, eat fast food often and do not eat fruit regularly are more likely to consume sugar-sweetened beverages frequently. Adolescents who frequently consume sugar-sweetened beverages also have more screen time (such as television, cell phones, computers, video games, etc.). These further compounds the negative effects and increases the risk for disease, disability, and death.1  

# INDICATORS  

o Nutrition   
o Physical activity   
o Alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use   
o Sexual risk behaviors

# KEY FINDINGS  

o One in 10 adults eat the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables per day   
$0$ One in five adults drink sugar-sweetened beverages at least once per day   
o Physical inactivity among adults and youth has increased   
o White adults and those with higher household incomes are more likely to report binge drinking, and Black adults and those with lower household incomes are more likely to report smoking cigarettes

▪ 13 times higher rates of gonorrhea Eight times higher rates of chlamydia ▪ Four times higher rates of syphilis  

o From 2017 to 2020 there has been a $10\%$ increase in adults who have gotten an annual flu vaccine o Kent County ranks $11^{\mathfrak{t h}}$ in Michigan for pediatric immunization rate and $5^{\mathrm{th}}$ for adolescent immunization rate  

# Nutrition  

Balanced nutrition includes getting enough fats, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Imbalances in nutrition can include undernutrition (i.e., not eating enough, or not getting enough nutrients through healthy foods), and overnutrition (i.e., consuming too many calories or too much fat, salt, or sugar).  

Barriers to healthy eating include limited availability and access to healthy foods, high cost, and perceived lack of cooking knowledge or preparation time. Kent County residents also noted that cost and convenience are two major factors when making decisions about food, and that transportation is a significant barrier for those without a personal vehicle.  

# Community Voices  

“There's a Burger King, a Pizza Hut, a Hungry Howie's, a Taco Bell all within two blocks of my apartment. But if you don't   
have a vehicle, it's going to take you 40 minutes to get to the closest grocery store. So if you're trying to live a healthier lifestyle and not live off of fast food, but [don’t] have a vehicle, it's like, ‘Okay, do I want to make my dinner arrangements and take three hours just to go grocery   
shopping, or I can go walk to KFC and be back in 20 minutes.’”  

–Focus group participant  

The largest disparities in food insecurity are among young adults, people with disabilities, those with lower educational attainment, and lower household income. Although there is little difference in food insecurity by race/ethnicity, Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino adults are 2.5 times more likely to experience low food security (Figure 39).  

FIGURE 39

Food insecurity is defined as "often" running out of food and not having money to buy more, or not being able to afford balanced meals in the past 12 months  

Low food security is defined as "sometimes" running out of food and not having money to buy more, or not being able to afford balanced meal in the past 12 months  

# FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION  

Depending on age and sex, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends eating approximately five servings of fruits and vegetables per day (1.5-2 cups of fruits and 2-3 cups of vegetables). In Kent County, only about one in ten adults $(11.3\%)$ reported meeting these recommendations in 2020 (Figure 40). Among youth, about one in four $(24.5\%)$ reported eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. 1  

Those with a high school degree or less educational attainment are less likely to meet the nutritional recommendations and more likely to report low fruit and vegetable consumption than those with some college or higher educational attainment. Education level was also correlated with healthy food insecurity— $38.1\%$ of those with less than a high school education were sometimes or often not able to afford balanced meals in the past year, which decreased as education level increased, to $7.8\%$ of college graduates reporting healthy food insecurity.

# SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION  

Sugar-sweetened beverages, or sugary drinks, include any beverage with added sugar or other sweeteners. This includes soda, pop, fruit punch, sweet tea, sweetened powdered drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks. Sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest source of calories and added sugar in the American diet; frequent consumption is associated with weight gain and obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, tooth decay and cavities, and gout (a type of arthritis).1  

In Kent County, one in five adults consume at least one sugary drink per day. Younger adults, males, Black and Hispanic adults, and those with lower educational attainment and lower household incomes are most likely to report high sugarsweetened beverage consumption (Figure 41). Among youth, about one in six $(17.0\%)$ middle and high school-age students drank soda or pop once or more per day.2

# Physical Activity  

Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy body weight and normal muscle strength, bone mass, and joint function. It has been shown to prevent chronic disease, help manage conditions such as arthritis, and effectively treat chronic pain. Physical activity can also improve mental health, relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improve cognitive function.1  

In Kent County, walking is the most common physical activity residents reported, followed by running and weightlifting. However, physical inactivity rates among adults have been increasing and are at the highest point since 2002. In 2020, one quarter of Kent County residents reported no leisure-time physical activity in the past 30 days (Figure 42). Hispanic or Latino adults are significantly more likely to report physical inactivity $(41.9\%)$ compared to Black $(24.4\%)$ and White $(23.8\%)$ adults. Physical inactivity is also correlated with socioeconomic status (higher rates of physical inactivity among those with lower educational attainment and lower household incomes).

# Community-Identified Need: Exercise Opportunities  

Community input data revealed a need for affordable, safe exercise and recreation opportunities in the winter months, particularly for youth and older adults. Lack of activities for youth and the availability, quality, and maintenance of sidewalks in some areas were both issues that prevented some residents from getting daily exercise.  

Community members who participated in the survey or focus groups also described the importance of the social aspect of physical activity, and how exercising with or around other people is motivational and makes exercise more enjoyable. However, the cost of gym memberships and group fitness classes was a significant barrier for many.

# Alcohol, Tobacco, and Marijuana Use  

# ALCOHOL USE  

Excessive alcohol use includes binge drinking (four or more drinks on any occasion for women or five or more for men) and heavy drinking (eight or more drinks per week for women or 15 or more for men). Over time, excessive alcohol use can lead to health problems such as chronic disease, alcohol use disorder or dependency, and problems with learning, memory, and mental health. In Kent County, the rate of heavy drinking $(2.1\%)$ is well below the state $(6.2\%)$ ) and national $(6.5\%)$ average. The rate of binge drinking in Kent County $(15.8\%)$ is slightly lower than the rate in Michigan $(17.9\%)$ and the U.S. $(16.8\%)$ .1 The prevalence of binge drinking is higher among Kent County adults under age 55, males, Whites, and those with higher household incomes (above $\$35,000$ .  

Adults under age 55, males, Whites, and those with a household income below $\$35,000$ are significantly more likely to binge drink than those over age 55, females, Blacks and Hispanics, and lower household incomes (Figure 45).  

# TOBACCO USE  

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the U.S. The prevalence of current smokers in Kent County $(13.5\%)$ has decreased since 2017 (down from $15.4\%$ and is lower than the state and national average $18.7\%$ and $16.0\%,$ respectively). Approximately two-thirds of current smokers in Kent County have tried to quit in the past year $(60.3\%)$ .  

Unlike excessive alcohol use, the rate of current smokers is higher among Black adults, and those with lower educational attainment and household income. Since 2017, the most significant decreases in smoking prevalence has been among adults age 25-34 $22.6\%$ to $12.2\%$ ), Hispanics and Latinos ( $16.5\%$ to $9.9\%$ ), and those with a household income less than $\$20,000$ ( $28.8\%$ to $14.3\%$ ).  

Among youth, less than two percent of middle and high school-age students reported smoking cigarettes in the past 30 days. However, $6.7\%$ of middle schoolers and $15.0\%$ of high schoolers reported using e-cigarettes or vape products in the past 30 days (Figure 46).  

# MARIJUANA USE  

Recreational marijuana use was legalized in the state of Michigan in 2018, although it remains illegal at the federal level. Use is increasing while the perception of how harmful marijuana use can be is declining. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), one in 10 adults who use marijuana can become addicted. This rate is even higher for adolescents, for which one in six who start using before age 18 can become addicted.2 In Kent County, $12.7\%$ of high school students and $3.5\%$ of middle school student reported using marijuana in the past 30 days (Figure 46).  

Among adults, $16.1\%$ reported using marijuana in the past 30 days, and $9.4\%$ reported using marijuana on 14 or more days. Young adults are significantly more likely to report recent use $(31.7\%)$ and frequent use $(19.7\%)$ compared to older age groups. Just under half of those who used marijuana in the past 30 days reported using it for both medical and non-medical reasons $(44.3\%)$ and most reported smoking it $(75.5\%)$ , eating it $(10.4\%)$ , or vaporizing $(6.9\%)$ .

# PERCEIVED ACCESS TO DRUGS & ALCOHOL AMONG YOUTH  

One in three high school students reported that it was sort of easy or very easy to get cigarettes $(31.9\%)$ or marijuana $(38.8\%)$ , and half thought it was easy to get alcohol $(47.9\%)$ .  

Among middle school-age students, one in five thought it was easy to get cigarettes $(19.6\%)$ , one in seven thought it was easy to get marijuana $(13.9\%)$ , and one in three thought it was easy to get alcohol $(27.7\%)$  

# Sexual Risk Behaviors  

Risky sexual behaviors can result in unintended health problems such as HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections, and unplanned pregnancy. Promoting a positive approach to sexuality and sexual relationships is an important public health goal.1  

# HIGH-RISK HIV BEHAVIORS  

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a preventable disease. People who get tested for HIV and learn they are infected can make significant behavior changes to improve their health and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their sex or drug-using partners.2 High-risk HIV behaviors includes any of the following situations: injected any drug other than those prescribed; been treated for a sexually transmitted disease or STD; or given or received money or drugs in exchange for sex. Among adults age 18-64 in Kent County, $7.8\%$ have engaged in at least one high-risk behavior in the past year that increases the risk for HIV infection. The highest prevalence of HIV risk behaviors is among LGBTQ adults $(22.1\%)$ and young adults age 18-24 $(20.4\%)$ . This younger age group is also the most likely age group not to have been tested for HIV ( $68.8\%$ have never been tested, compared to $56.2\%$ for the county); whereas LGBTQ adults are much less likely to never have been tested for HIV (only $33.8\%$ have never been tested).  

# SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS  

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are transmitted from person to person through sexual intercourse or sexual contact with an infected person. There are more than 20 different types of STIs, which can be caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Common STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus (HPV), and syphilis. STIs are common – according to the CDC, about one in five people in the U.S. have an STI but many people don’t have any symptoms. Most STIs or the symptoms they cause can be treated, but without treatment they can lead to serious health problems.  

In Kent County, rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea are higher than the state of Michigan average. Syphilis and gonorrhea rates in 2019 were higher (16.0 and 195.9 per 100,000, respectively) than the previous five-year averages (12.2 and 151.8 per 100,000, respectively). The rate of new chlamydia infections in Kent County decreased slightly, from an average of 597.9 per 100,000 in 2014-2018, to 551.8 per 100,000 in 2019.  

There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in STI rates. The rate of syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea is about 2.5 to 13 times higher among Hispanic and Black residents in Kent County compared to their White counterparts (Table 13).

# Vaccinations  

Vaccinations are an important public health measure to prevent the spread of some communicable diseases and protect individuals from becoming infected. Currently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends immunizing adults against 15 infectious diseases, including influenza and pneumonia.1 However, just over half of adults in Kent County got an annual flu shot $(51.7\%)$ and about three-quarters of adults over the age of 65 have ever gotten a pneumonia shot $(72.7\%)$ . Together, influenza and pneumonia are the seventh leading cause of death in Kent County (Table 9).  

Since 2017, there has been an increase in the proportion of adults in Kent County who have gotten an annual flu shot, from $41.5\%$ to $51.7\%$ . The most notable increase was among adults age 65 and older—from $58.9\%$ in 2017 to $78.7\%$ in 2020. This age group was also the most likely to have gotten a flu shot compared to all other age groups. Among Kent County adults, there are some educational, racial, and ethnic disparities in annual flu vaccination rates. Those with a college degree are twice as likely $(59.5\%)$ to have gotten a flu shot in the past 12 months compared to those who have less than a high school education $(30.3\%)$ . White and non-Hispanic adults $(53.6\%)$ ) are also more likely than Black $(44.2\%)$ and Hispanic $(33.3\%)$ adults to be vaccinated.2  

Vaccination recommendations start just after birth and continue through adolescence and into adulthood. For pediatric immunization rates (ages 19-35 months), Kent County ranks $11^{\mathrm{th}}$ out of 84 Michigan counties, with $64.8\%$ of all children in that age group receiving the recommended vaccinations. The adolescent immunization rate in Kent County (for ages 13-17 years) is $53.3\%,$ ranking fifth out of all counties in Michigan.3

# 2020 Kent County Community Survey  

# Introduction  

Every three years, Kent County conducts a community health needs assessment (CHNA). The CHNA helps communities, organizations, and local health systems identify the major health-related challenges residents are facing. The issues identified will be the focus of health improvement efforts in the county for the next three years.  

We need to hear from you! We rely on voices and input from all over Kent County to learn about the different communities, their strengths, and the things that need improvement. This survey asks questions about you, your opinions and experiences related to general health and well-being. Some questions require only one answer, and other questions allow you to select multiple answers. The survey will take about 15 minutes to complete.  

Your participation is voluntary and your responses are anonymous. No identifying information is required to complete the survey. However, if you would like to enter a drawing for a chance to win a $\$50$ Visa gift card, we will ask for your contact information at the end of the survey. This will be stored separately from your survey answers and will be kept confidential and will not be shared.  

Results from this survey will be summarized and included in the 2020 CHNA report, which will be publicly available in the spring of 2021 on the Kent County Health Department’s website (www.accesskent.com) and through participating community organizations.
