Mental illness refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders, or health conditions that significantly affect mood, emotion, thinking or behavior, and often impact day-to-day living or ability to function. Examples of mental illnesses include depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder.1 As with many diseases, mental illness can be mild or severe. There are multiple factors that contribute to poor mental health and mental illness. Genetics, environment, and lifestyle often influence whether someone develops a mental health condition and things like stress and traumatic life events make some people more susceptible.2 ",
