These meetings with members of Cree communities were an effort to understand their values, perspectives and desires concerning Cree Education, and to align the Ends policies from the Council Policy Manual with what the Cree Nation wanted. In terms of the operations, the Council has set clear direction and purpose for the organization through its Ends policies, outlining clearly the benefits to be achieved on behalf of the students, staff and Cree Nation. Through the Executive Limitations policies, it also described the parameters within which the Director General is to manage the operations of the organization. Council delegates to the Director General with “one voice,” yet maintains control and authority without “meddling” in operational matters. Council’s focus has been on the governance of the Cree School Board. It created the Governance Process and CouncilManagement Delegation Policies to guide Council in its governance of the organization. Finally, the Council also assures that the Cree School Board as an organization operates at an optimal level. It conducts evaluations of the Director General and itself on a regular basis. ",

This was a proud moment for the community of Wemindji as members of the community and the school staff witnessed this announcement. While in Mistissini, the Ministers visited Voyageur Memorial School and visited a Cree Culture class.

Appointments to the working groups were by invitation and memberships consist of a cross-section of the Cree Nation: Elders, youth, men and women. Appointments of the working groups were based on education, work experience, knowledge of Cree culture, language, and history, as well as expertise in education, law, linguistics, and political science.

One of the efficiencies of adopting and working with Policy Governance is the required approvals items on the agenda. Items or agenda matters that usually took many hours of deliberations now take minutes to approve. Why? Two words. Policy Governance. How does Policy Governance work in relation to required approvals? There is a process that takes place prior to the submission of any agenda item under required approvals. The Council and Executive Committee review the documents a few days in advance so we are aware of the upcoming items. There could be twenty or more items on required approvals but they could be approved within ten minutes. Any items without proper documents such as a missing recommendation are usually deferred to the next regular meeting. Once Council or the Executive Committee are satisfied that the items contain all supporting documents, they are then approved in one sweeping motion. Like the Council of Commissioners meetings, the Executive Committee does not want to unilaterally approve agenda items without the supporting documents or recommendations. When the process is followed, it gives the Council of Commissioners and Executive Committee more time to deal with matters that are of great importance to the stakeholders through the ownership linkage meetings. Community input is therefore of great importance. On behalf of the Executive Committee, I would like to wish the best of continued success to the 2014-2015 Graduates. ",

L’un des gains d’efficacité que procurent l’adoption et l’utilisation de la politique de gouvernance concernent les points à l’ordre du jour qui exigent une approbation. Ces points qui nécessitaient habituellement de nombreuses heures de délibération font maintenant l’objet d’une approbation en quelques minutes. Pourquoi me demanderez-vous? La réponse est simple : la politique de gouvernance. Quel est le lien entre la politique de gouvernance et les approbations requises? Parce que nous suivons un processus précis avant la suggestion de points à l’ordre du jour exigeant une approbation. Le Conseil et le comité exécutif examinent les documents quelques jours avant afin de connaître les points à venir. Même si une vingtaine de points exigent une approbation, le tout s’effectue en dix minutes. Tous les points pour lesquels la documentation est insuffisante, notamment une recommandation manquante, sont reportés à l’assemblée ordinaire suivante. Dès que le Conseil ou le comité exécutif considère que tous les points sont accompagnés de tous les documents justificatifs, ils sont approuvés en bloc. Comme dans le cadre des réunions du Conseil des commissaires, le comité exécutif ne veut pas approuver unilatéralement les points à l’ordre du jour sans les documents justificatifs ou les recommandations appropriées. Lorsque ce processus est respecté, le Conseil des commissaires et le comité exécutif disposent davantage de temps pour traiter des enjeux plus importants aux yeux des intervenants dans le cadre des réunions sur les liens capitalistiques. Par conséquent, la participation de la communauté est d’une grande importance. Au nom du comité exécutif, j’aimerais souhaiter le meilleur des succès aux diplômés de 2014-2015. ",

I believe the opportunity to run our own Cree School Board as Cree people was meant for us to be successful at doing it. I don’t believe for one moment that our Cree leaders expected our Cree School Board organization, our schools and our education system to be disorganized, dysfunctional, and a failed system. The vision was to see our Cree people be successful in running and controlling their own school board and education system. However, more importantly, the intended outcome of this vision was to ensure that our Cree students succeed in their education at all levels including youth, adult education, and Post-Secondary education, and that they become successful contributors within our Cree society in a significant way.

Parents and families must realize that they have a major role in the development and growth of their children in their physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being. I believe our students will be more eager, engaging, and willing to learn in our classrooms and schools if parents take the primary role of teaching them first at home.

Les révisions du CGV sont fondées sur les commentaires des enseignants recueillis au moyen de sondages et sur les visites de mise en œuvre du CGV dans les écoles. Le programme de secondaires 1 et 2 a fait l’objet d’une mise en œuvre complète et les enseignants concernés ont suivi une formation pédagogique. Quant au programme de secondaire 3 (première année du deuxième cycle), il a été rédigé et sera présenté aux enseignants en août. Le CGV pour l’enseignement de la science au niveau primaire, le CGV à l’intention des élèves du 1er, 2e et 3e cycles, ainsi que le CGV pour l’enseignement de la langue crie au secondaire (premier cycle) ont été mis en œuvre.

To improve reading and writing, teachers used effective strategies such as guided reading & writing, reading buddies and interactive notebooks. In mathematics, some teachers used manipulatives, but many used word walls and fractals to focus on specific math components. To monitor students’ progress, we used the PM Benchmark reading assessment at each term and CAMS & STAMS to assess students’ math levels. On the 2015 CAT scores, some improvement has been seen at the grade 6 level, especially in writing as we have achieved our LSIP goal of $15\\%$ at Stanine 4 or above with a $17\\%$ success rate. On the other hand, we will closely monitor the needs of the secondary 3 students as little to no improvements have been seen on the CAT scores. ",
