Mumbai:  

OCTROI is applicable in Mumbai  

What is OCTROI?  

The word OCTROI has its roots in the French word 'Octroyer' which is derived from a Latin word auctorizare, the literal meaning being to authorize or to grant. It used to denote a tax levied on goods brought into town, and was collected at the city gates. Since this levy was imposed under Octroyer, that is, a royal grant, it was known as octro is, which later became OCTROI.  

In modern usage Octroi is a local tax collected on articles brought into a town for local use by various local bodies like corporations, municipalities, zillaparishads, village panchayats etc.  

Levy of Octroi is based on the value, weight, length and number of articles. Basis of levy may vary from State to State or even between different local bodies within a State.  

Municipal Corporation of Mumbai is known as Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) The BMC used to levy a tax called 'Town Duty' since 1912 for all articles imported into the town limits irrespective of whether the articles brought in were to be consumed, used or sold within its limit or not.  

In 1965, Octroi a tax to be levied on specified articles at their time of entry into the limits of the Greater Bombay for consumption, use or sale was introduced. The Municipal Commissioner is empowered to frame rules, governing the procedures of levy, Assessment and collection of Octroi, refund and exemption.  

Places of import were identified for purpose of levy  

1. Import by Sea: Docks Wharfs   
2. Import by Rail: Railway stations, Depots, Sidings   
3. Import by Air: Airport terminals   
4. Import by Road: Municipal Octroi posts at roads across Greater Bombay limits  

For shipments received by air DOTZOT clears through the dedicated octroi terminal available at BDA for apex

The check post authorities retain form \`A' along with the photocopy of the Invoice. Form \`B' along with the original document is handed over to the customer in our case its through DOTZOT to the consignee.  

# C & CC FORM  

In the event of wrong payment of Octroi or rejection of a material by the consignee in BOM due to a valid reason, Octroi refund can be claimed from the Municipal Corporation.   
The goods for which Octroi refund is to be claimed has to be exported out of Mumbai under Form-C in case the export is by sea or air or under Form-CC in case the export is by road.   
After the Form-C or Form-CC is stamped at the check post the customer in Mumbai has to apply for refund with the BMC authorities.  

The amount paid as Octroi is refunded after deducting $6.25\%$ as service charges by MMC.

# N - FORM  

Is an application for exemption in respect of articles imported for immediate export? Goods cleared under Nform should be exported within 7 days (168 hrs)  

N-form is required for exemption from Octroi for shipments imported into Mumbai for immediate exports i.e. for shipments transiting through Mumbai.  

For apex shipments transiting through Mumbai received by air the DOTZOT Apex team completes the N- form in triplicate.  

The Octroi inspector in the airline cargo warehouse checks the shipments against consignment airway bill invoice and certifies the N-form.  

The certified copies (3 copies) of N-form accompany the shipment and the paperwork to the exit check post. These exit check post can be any one of the five-road check post listed above.  

At the exit check post, the Octroi inspector checks and stamps the N-form and returns the Original copy of N-form to DOTZOT staff.  

For apex shipments received by surface for upliftment by air, the BHI staff complete the N-form in triplicate.  

At the entry check post (EEH), Octroi inspector verifies the shipment against invoice/airway bill, and certifies the N-form and hands over the triplicate copy to DOTZOT staff.  

This copy of N-form along with other paperwork and the shipment is produced to the octroi inspector at airline cargo warehouse for closing of the N-form.  

- In case the shipment does not tally with the description on invoice or the invoice is incomplete/incorrect the shipment may be detained by the octroi inspector.  

- In case the consignee imports the shipment into Mumbai for export on his own through rail, road, sea or air subsequently the N-form formality will have to be completed by consignee in case he wants exemption from Octroi. - In case for some reason the point of exit/export needs to be changed DOTZOT staff will have to file application for redirection paying the requisite fees.  

- In case of non-closure of N-form both the consignor and the carrier, in our case DOTZOT, are liable to pay an amount equivalent to the Octroi amount that may have accrued had the shipment not been cleared through NForm, and the risk of being black listed and de-recognized by BMC.

Stock transfer: The shipment should accompany with a duly filled Form 47. In the absence of the said form, penalty equivalent to $30\%$ of the invoice value will be charged to the consignee.  

# Unregistered Dealer / Individual  

If the items (listed as applicable for VAT-47) are not coming for resale but own consumption by the consignee who is an individual, which is not registered with the sales tax department (i.e. has no CST or LST no) then a signed declaration from the consignee that the items are for own use and not for resale should accompany the shipments.

# Inbound Shipments  

# Registered Dealers:  

Form 38 is mandatory for all commercial shipments traveling to Uttar Pradesh. The form can be generated online and it’s known as E Sancharan.  

As per new notification of Uttar Pradesh Commercial Tax department, E-Sancharan can be generated in 2 parts by using partial load.  

In first Part customer will update the details like consignor and consignee Name, Address, Invoice no, Value etc. after saving the details system will generate an Interim Number and customer will provide the same number to transporter.  

With the interim number transporter will generate the final E-Sancharan by updating the transporter and Vehicle detail before entering the shipments into Uttar Pradesh.  

# Un-Registered Dealers / Individuals:  

Form 39 is mandatory for all personal/noncommercial shipments traveling to Uttar Pradesh. Form 39 should be in 3 parts marked original, duplicate, triplicate. Original part is retained by Sales Tax Department of check post at the time of entry and the duplicate delivered to consignee along with the shipment. Note: Manual Form 39 without signature and stamp of Sales Tax Department of UP is not valid. It should be properly filled with stamp and signature of consignor & consignee.
