# Observations – Traffic Trends  

Where traffic growth on major roads has occurred: – US-26 in West Jackson (at Y intersection & High School Rd) WY-22 in Wilson   
Except at the Y Intersection, little traffic growth has occurred in Teton County since 2006   
Visitor traffic has grown less than 1%  annually   
START service increases & Village TDM program have reduced traffic growth in the Town to Village corridor  

# Conclusions  

Traffic growth has been driven by economics increased commercial space + dwelling units in West Jackson increased in-commuting (both Teton Pass & Snake River)  

Visitorship has not been a source of increased traffic Teton County population has been decentralizing Transit has been effective in Town – Village corridor Core area circulation – all modes – is an important need  

# Baseline Scenario  

# Baseline Scenario  

No further change in per capita VMT   
Future land use: – consistent with Comprehensive Plan   
– growth rate based on past decade (2003 – 2013)   
VMT and traffic increase as:   
– population and commercial space increases – visitorship increases in commuting increases

# Major Capital Projects  

Approach implementation strategically Use a network approach (capital project groups) Begin with WYDOT’s PEL study (WY-22 & WY-390) Use benchmarks to guide project development  

![](images/5d9f1b86df667cc8655094fa946264794202db8eaba2c62ae336954d869a380c.jpg)  

# Policy Decision  

Com Plan Policy 8.2.b:   Design critical infrastructure and facilities for the peak effective population.  Critical facilities, as defined by the electeds through service level planning, should be designed to provide an acceptable level of service to the peak effective population. Other facilities will be designed to accommodate average demand. Temporarily reduced service level may occur at times of peak population; however, reductions should not produce a meaningful threat to the public safety.

# Y Intersection Issues & Opportunities  

Issues  

Opportunities – Scale of project – Network approach – Cost of project – Tribal Trails Connector – Visual impacts – Bus prioritization Walk/bike barrier – Longer service life – Transit operations – WYDOT collaboration  

Recommended Approach   
– Project development based on network   
– Address multimodal design  

# Tribal Trails Issues & Opportunities  

Issues • Opportunities   
– Neighborhood impacts – Network approach   
– Lack of County funding – Local connectivity – Route redundancy – START operations – WYDOT collaboration   
Recommended Approach   
– Request WYDOT include in project development – Address design options to reduce impacts

# Basis for Recommendation  

Feasible transit program (transit demand is   
already exceeding supply)   
Helps avoid/postpone major highway projects   
that detract from local character   
Supports other local objectives  

# Implementation  

# Implementation  

1. Double transit service by 2024   
2. Implement a TDM\* program   
3. Apply benchmarking system to major projects   
4. Improve internal connectivity in town & village   
5. Establish an RTA\*\*  

\* TDM = transportation demand management \*\* RTA = regional transportation authority  

# 1.  Significant Increase in Transit Service Levels

# Transit – Strategic Options  

1.  Fares and Passes  

Fare-free Valley services (\$1 million/year) Implement bulk-rate discount commuter pass  

2.  Commuter Services  

Increase service levels (# of runs/day) Implement express runs + local runs  

# Transit – Strategic Options  

3.  Corridor Services  

Further increases in level of service (runs/day) New service to airport New service to Grant Teton National Park  

4.  Circulator Services  

Split Town Shuttle into linear routes  

# Tentative 2024 Transit Plan  

Add runs to both commuter routes   
Increase summer service to Teton Villag   
Break Town Shuttle up into linear routes   
Update pass and fare options   
Initiate a three-year pilot – Jackson to Grand Teton Park (Jenny Lake) – June 15 – September 15 – Half-hour frequency each direction – Adjust and tweak each season – Look for partnerships  

# Potential 2035 Transit Plan  

Convert Town Village service to BRT (Bus   
Rapid Transit)   
Add remote “light” maintenance facilities at   
other end of commuter routes   
Include possible high capacity transit corridor   
in any environmental process to evaluate   
bypass alternatives

2.  Implement a cooperative\* “transportation demand management” (TDM) program  

\* Town, county, WYDOT, Park Service, major employers  

# TDM Program Elements  

Employer coordination   
Transit passes – commuter and visitor   
Guaranteed ride home for commuters   
Events, promotions   
Information clearinghouse – esp. transit   
Tourist and visitor outreach   
Bikeshare and car share   
Monitoring and reporting for ITP  

3.  Use a benchmarking system to guide decisions about major corridor projects
