# DESCRIPTION  

The TLV320AIC32 is a low-power stereo-audio codec with a stereo headphone amplifier, as well as multiple inputs and outputs, programmable in single-ended or fully-differential configurations. Extensive register- based power control is included, enabling stereo 48-kHz DAC playback as low as $\overline{{14}}\ m\boldsymbol{\mathsf{W}}$ from a 3.3-V analog supply, making it ideal for portable, battery-powered audio and telephony applications.  

The record path of the TLV320AIC32 contains integrated microphone bias, digitally-controlled stereo-microphone pre-amp, and automatic gain control (AGC), with mix/mux capability among the multiple analog inputs. The playback path includes mix/mux capability from the stereo DAC and selected inputs, through programmable volume controls, to the various outputs.  

The TLV320AIC32 contains four high-power output drivers as well as two fully differential output drivers. The high-power output drivers are capable of driving a variety of load configurations, including up to four channels of single-ended 16-Ω headphones using ac-coupling capacitors, or stereo 16-Ω headphones in a cap-less output configuration. In addition, pairs of drivers can be used to drive 8-Ω speakers in a BTL configuration at $500~\mathrm{{\dot{m}}}\mathrm{{\dot{w}}}$ per channel.  

The stereo audio DAC supports sampling rates from $8~{\mathsf{k H z}}$ to $96k H z$ and includes programmable digital filtering in the DAC path for 3D, bass, treble, midrange effects, speaker equalization, and de-emphasis for 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and $48~\mathsf{k H z}$ rates. The stereo-audio ADC supports sampling rates from 8 kHz to $96~\mathsf{k H z}$ and is preceded by programmable gain amplifiers providing up to $+59.5$ dB analog gain for low-level microphone inputs.  

The serial control bus supports the $1^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ protocol, while the serial-audio data bus is programmable for $1^{2}\mathsf{S}$ , left/right justified, DSP, or TDM modes. A highly programmable PLL is included for flexible clock generation and support for all standard audio rates from a wide range of available MCLKs, varying from $512~{\mathsf{k H z}}$ to 50 MHz, with special attention paid to the most popular cases of 12 MHz, 13 MHz, 16 MHz, 19.2 MHz, and 19.68 MHz system clocks.  

The TLV320AIC32 operates from an analog supply of $2.7\:\forall\:-3.6\:\forall$ , a digital core supply of $1.65\:\forall\mathrm{~-~}1.95\:\forall$ , and a digital I/O supply of 1. $\mid\vee-3.6\vee$ . The device is available in a $5\times5~\mathsf{m m}$ , 32-lead QFN package.

(1) Ratio of output level with 1-kHz full-scale sine wave input, to the output level with the inputs short circuited, measured A-weighted over a $20-H z$ to 20-kHz bandwidth using an audio analyzer. (2) All performance measurements done with $20-k H z$ low-pass filter and, where noted, A-weighted filter. Failure to use such a filter may result in higher $T H D+N$ and lower SNR and dynamic range readings than shown in the Electrical Characteristics. The low-pass filter removes out-of-band noise, which, although not audible, may affect dynamic specification values.

# OVERVIEW  

The TLV320AIC32 is a highly flexible, low power, stereo audio codec with extensive feature integration, intended for applications in smartphones, PDAs, and portable computing, communication, and entertainment applications. Available in a $5\times5~\mathsf{m m}$ , 32-lead QFN, the product integrates a host of features to reduce cost, board space, and power consumption in space-constrained, battery-powered, portable applications.  

The TLV320AIC32 consists of the following blocks:  

Stereo audio multi-bit delta-sigma DAC (8 kHz – 96 kHz)   
Stereo audio multi-bit delta-sigma ADC (8 kHz – 96 kHz)   
Programmable digital audio effects processing (3-D, bass, treble, mid-range, EQ, de-emphasis)   
Six audio inputs   
Four high-power audio output drivers (headphone/speaker drive capability)   
Three fully differential line output drivers   
Fully programmable PLL   
Headphone/headset jack detection with interrupt  

# HARDWARE RESET  

The TLV320AIC32 requires a hardware reset after power-up for proper operation. After all power supplies are at their specified values, the RESET pin must be driven low for at least 10 ns. If this reset sequence is not performed, the 'AIC32 may not respond properly to register reads/writes.  

# DIGITAL CONTROL SERIAL INTERFACE  

The register map of the TLV320AIC32 actually consists of multiple pages of registers, with each page containing 128 registers. The register at address zero on each page is used as a page-control register, and writing to this register determines the active page for the device. All subsequent read/write operations will access the page that is active at the time, unless a register write is performed to change the active page. Only two pages of registers are implemented in this product, with the active page defaulting to page 0 upon device reset.  

For example, at device reset, the active page defaults to page 0, and thus all register read/write operations for addresses 1 to 127 will access registers in page 0. If registers on page 1 must be accessed, the user must write the 8-bit sequence $0{\times}01$ to register 0, the page control register, to change the active page from page 0 to page 1. After this write, it is recommended the user also read back the page control register, to safely ensure the change in page control has occurred properly. Future read/write operations to addresses 1 to 127 will now access registers in page 1. When page 0 registers must be accessed again, the user writes the 8-bit sequence $0\times00$ to register 0, the page control register, to change the active page back to page 0. After a recommended read of the page control register, all further read/write operations to addresses 1 to 127 will now access page 0 registers again.  

# I2C CONTROL INTERFACE  

The TLV320AIC32 supports the $1^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ control protocol using 7-bit addressing and is capable of both standard and fast modes. For ${\mathsf{I}}^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ fast mode, note that the minimum timing for each of tHD-STA, tSU-STA, and tSU-STO is 2.0 µs, as seen in Figure 17. The TLV320AIC32 will respond to the ${\mathsf{I}}^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ address of 0011000. I2C is a two-wire, open-drain interface supporting multiple devices and masters on a single bus. Devices on the ${\mathsf{I}}^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ bus only drive the bus lines LOW by connecting them to ground; they never drive the bus lines HIGH. Instead, the bus wires are pulled HIGH by pull-up resistors, so the bus wires are HIGH when no device is driving them LOW. This way, two devices cannot conflict; if two devices drive the bus simultaneously, there is no driver contention.  

![](images/4c2f5e75a4f3d5506fffd183da06340b516acb7a4c98458f73168c877c59d236.jpg)  
Figure 17. I2C Interface Timing  

Communication on the $\mathsf{I}^{2}\mathsf{C}$ bus always takes place between two devices, one acting as the master and the other acting as the slave. Both masters and slaves can read and write, but slaves can only do so under the direction of the master. Some ${\mathsf{I}}^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ devices can act as masters or slaves, but the TLV320AIC32 can only act as a slave device.  

An $1^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ bus consists of two lines, SDA and SCL. SDA carries data; SCL provides the clock. All data is transmitted across the ${\mathsf{I}}^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ bus in groups of eight bits. To send a bit on the $1^{2}{\dot{\mathsf{C}}}$ bus, the SDA line is driven to the appropriate level while SCL is LOW (a LOW on SDA indicates the bit is zero; a HIGH indicates the bit is one). Once the SDA line has settled, the SCL line is brought HIGH, then LOW. This pulse on SCL clocks the SDA bit into the receivers shift register.  

The $1^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ bus is bidirectional: the SDA line is used both for transmitting and receiving data. When a master reads from a slave, the slave drives the data line; when a master sends to a slave, the master drives the data line. Under normal circumstances the master drives the clock line.  

Most of the time the bus is idle, no communication is taking place, and both lines are HIGH. When communication is taking place, the bus is active. Only master devices can start a communication. They do this by causing a START condition on the bus. Normally, the data line is only allowed to change state while the clock line is LOW. If the data line changes state while the clock line is HIGH, it is either a START condition or its counterpart, a STOP condition. A START condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from HIGH to LOW. A STOP condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from LOW to HIGH.  

After the master issues a START condition, it sends a byte that indicates which slave device it wants to communicate with. This byte is called the address byte. Each device on an ${\mathsf{I}}^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ bus has a unique 7-bit address to which it responds. (Slaves can also have 10-bit addresses; see the $\mathsf{I}^{2}\mathsf{C}$ specification for details.) The master sends an address in the address byte, together with a bit that indicates whether it wishes to read from or write to the slave device.  

Every byte transmitted on the $1^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ bus, whether it is address or data, is acknowledged with an acknowledge bit. When a master has finished sending a byte (eight data bits) to a slave, it stops driving SDA and waits for the slave to acknowledge the byte. The slave acknowledges the byte by pulling SDA LOW. The master then sends a clock pulse to clock the acknowledge bit. Similarly, when a master has finished reading a byte, it pulls SDA LOW to acknowledge this to the slave. It then sends a clock pulse to clock the bit.  

A not-acknowledge is performed by simply leaving SDA HIGH during an acknowledge cycle. If a device is not present on the bus, and the master attempts to address it, it will receive a not−acknowledge because no device is present at that address to pull the line LOW.  

When a master has finished communicating with a slave, it may issue a STOP condition. When a STOP condition is issued, the bus becomes idle again. A master may also issue another START condition. When a START condition is issued while the bus is active, it is called a repeated START condition.  

The TLV320AIC32 also responds to and acknowledges a General Call, which consists of the master issuing a command with a slave address byte of 00H.

Figure 19. I2C Read  

In the case of an $1^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ register write, if the master does not issue a STOP condition, then the device enters auto-increment mode. So in the next eight clocks, the data on SDA is treated as data for the next incremental register.  

Similarly, in the case of an $1^{2}{\mathsf{C}}$ register read, after the device has sent out the 8-bit data from the addressed register, if the master issues a ACKNOWLEDGE, the slave takes over control of SDA bus and transmit for the next 8 clocks the data of the next incremental register.  

# DIGITAL AUDIO DATA SERIAL INTERFACE  

Audio data is transferred between the host processor and the TLV320AIC32 via the digital audio data serial interface, or audio bus. The audio bus of the TLV320AIC32 can be configured for left or right justified, I2S, DSP, or TDM modes of operation, where communication with standard telephony PCM interfaces is supported within the TDM mode. These modes are all MSB-first, with data width programmable as 16, 20, 24, or 32 bits. In addition, the word clock (WCLK) and bit clock (BCLK) can be independently configured in either Master or Slave mode, for flexible connectivity to a wide variety of processors  

The word clock (WCLK) is used to define the beginning of a frame, and may be programmed as either a pulse or a square-wave signal. The frequency of this clock corresponds to the maximum of the selected ADC and DAC sampling frequencies.  

The bit clock (BCLK) is used to clock in and out the digital audio data across the serial bus. When in Master mode, this signal can be programmed in two further modes: continuous transfer mode, and 256-clock mode. In continuous transfer mode, only the minimal number of bit clocks needed to transfer the audio data are generated, so in general the number of bit clocks per frame will be two times the data width. For example, if data width is chosen as 16-bits, then 32 bit clocks will be generated per frame. If the bit clock signal in master mode will be used by a PLL in another device, it is recommended that the 16-bit or 32-bit data width selections be used. These cases result in a low jitter bit clock signal being generated, having frequencies of $32\times F s$ or $64\times F s$ . In the cases of 20-bit and 24-bt data width in master mode, the bit clocks generated in each frame will not all be of equal period, due to the device not having a clean $40\times F s$ or $48\times F s$ clock signal readily available. The average frequency of the bit clock signal is still accurate in these cases (being $40\times F\bar{\mathsf{s}}$ or $48\times F s)$ , but the resulting clock signal has higher jitter than in the 16-bit and 32-bit cases.  

In 256-clock mode, a constant 256 bit clocks per frame are generated, independent of the data width chosen. The TLV320AIC32 further includes programmability to tri-state the DOUT line during all bit clocks when valid data is not being sent. By combining this capability with the ability to program at what bit clock in a frame the audio data will begin, time-division multiplexing (TDM) can be accomplished, resulting in multiple codecs able to use a single audio serial data bus.  

When the audio serial data bus is powered down while configured in master mode, the pins associated with the interface will be put into a tri-state output condition.  

# RIGHT JUSTIFIED MODE  

In right-justified mode, the LSB of the left channel is valid on the rising edge of the bit clock preceding the falling edge of word clock. Similarly, the LSB of the right channel is valid on the rising edge of the bit clock preceding the rising edge of the word clock.

Figure 20. Right Justified Serial Bus Mode Operation  

# LEFT JUSTIFIED MODE  

In left-justified mode, the MSB of the right channel is valid on the rising edge of the bit clock following the falling edge of the word clock. Similarly the MSB of the left channel is valid on the rising edge of the bit clock following the rising edge of the word clock.

Figure 21. Left Justified Serial Data Bus Mode Operation  

# I2S MODE  

In I2S mode, the MSB of the left channel is valid on the second rising edge of the bit clock after the falling edge of the word clock. Similarly the MSB of the right channel is valid on the second rising edge of the bit clock after the rising edge of the word clock.

Figure 22. I2S Serial Data Bus Mode Operation  

# DSP MODE  

In DSP mode, the rising edge of the word clock starts the data transfer with the left channel data first an immediately followed by the right channel data. Each data bit is valid on the falling edge of the bit clock.

Figure 23. DSP Serial Bus Mode Operation  

# TDM DATA TRANSFER  

Time-division multiplexed data transfer can be realized in any of the above transfer modes if the 256-clock bit clock mode is selected, although it is recommended to be used in either left-justified mode or DSP mode. By changing the programmable offset, the bit clock in each frame where the data begins can be changed, and the serial data output driver (DOUT) can also be programmed to tri-state during all bit clocks except when valid data is being put onto the bus. This allows other codecs to be programmed with different offsets and to drive their data onto the same DOUT line, just in a different slot. For incoming data, the codec simply ignores data on the bus except where it is expected based on the programmed offset.  

Note that the location of the data when an offset is programmed is different, depending on what transfer mode is selected. In DSP mode, both left and right channels of data are transferred immediately adjacent to each other in the frame. This differs from left-justified mode, where the left and right channel data will always be a half-frame apart in each frame. In this case, as the offset is programmed from zero to some higher value, both the left and right channel data move across the frame, but still stay a full half-frame apart from each other. This is depicted in Figure 24 for the two cases.

# AUDIO DATA CONVERTERS  

The TLV320AIC32 supports the following standard audio sampling rates: 8 kHz, 11.025 kHz, $12k H z$ , $16k H z.$ , 22.05 kHz, 24 kHz, 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and 96 kHz. The converters can also operate at different sampling rates in various combinations, which are described further below.  

The data converters are based on the concept of an Fsref rate that is used internal to the part, and it is related to the actual sampling rates of the converters through a series of ratios. For typical sampling rates, Fsref will be either 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, although it can realistically be set over a wider range of rates up to $53k\mathsf{H}z$ , with additional restrictions applying if the PLL is used. This concept is used to set the sampling rates of the ADC and DAC, and also to enable high quality playback of low sampling rate data, without high frequency audible noise being generated.  

The sampling rate of the ADC and DAC can be set to Fsref/NDAC or $2\times$ Fsref/NDAC, with NDAC being 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, or 6.  

# AUDIO CLOCK GENERATION  

The audio converters in the TLV320AIC32 need an internal audio master clock at a frequency of 256×Fsref, which can be obtained in a variety of manners from an external clock signal applied to the device.  

A more detailed diagram of the audio clock section of the TLV320AIC32 is shown in Figure 25.  

![](images/f1ad6d612b745c197112df58a4c2643d40be705e14340d09d9b51a77f8669109.jpg)  
Figure 25. Audio Clock Generation Processing  

The part can accept an MCLK input from $512~{\mathsf{k H z}}$ to $50~\mathsf{M H z}$ , which can then be passed through either a programmable divider or a PLL, to get the proper internal audio master clock needed by the part. The BCLK input can also be used to generate the internal audio master clock.  

A primary concern is proper operation of the codec at various sample rates with the limited MCLK frequencies available in the system. This device includes a highly programmable PLL to accommodate such situations easily. The integrated PLL can generate audio clocks from a wide variety of possible MCLK inputs, with particular focus paid to the standard MCLK rates already widely used.  

When the PLL is disabled, $\mathsf{F s r e f}=\mathsf{C L K D I V\_I N}/\left(128\times\mathsf{Q}\right)$   
Where $\mathsf Q=2$ , 3, …, 17 CLKDIV_IN can be MCLK or BCLK, selected by register 102, bits D7-D6.   
NOTE – when ${\mathsf{N D A C}}=1.5,$ , 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, or 5.5, odd values of Q are not allowed. In this mode, MCLK can be as   
high as $50M H z$ , and Fsref should fall within $39\mathsf{k H z}$ to $53k H z$ .  

When the PLL is enabled, Fsref $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ (PLLCLK_IN × K × R) / $(2048\times\mathsf{P})$ , where $\mathsf{P}=1,2,3,...,8$ $\mathsf{R}=1,2,...,16$ ${\sf K}={\sf J}.{\sf D}$ J = 1, 2, 3, …, 63 ${\sf D}=0000$ , 0001, 0002, 0003, …, 9998, 9999 PLLCLK_IN can be MCLK or BCLK, selected by Page 0, register 102, bits D5-D4  

P, R, J, and $\mathsf{D}$ are register programmable. J is the integer portion of K (the numbers to the left of the decima point), while D is the fractional portion of K (the numbers to the right of the decimal point, assuming four digits o precision).  

# Examples:  

If ${\sf K}=8.5$ , then $\mathsf{J}=8$ , $\mathsf{D}=5000$ If $\mathsf{K}=7.12$ , then $\mathsf{J}=7$ , $\mathsf{D}=1200$ If ${\sf K}=14.03$ , then $\mathsf{J}=14$ , ${\sf D}=0300$ If $\mathsf{K}=6.0004$ , then $\mathsf{J}=6$ , $\mathsf{D}=0004$  

When the PLL is enabled and $\textsf{D}=\ 0000$ , the following conditions must be satisfied to meet specified   
performance: 2 MHz ≤ ( PLLCLK_IN / P ) ≤ 20 MHz $\frac{80\mathsf{M}\mathsf{H}z\dot{\leq}(\mathsf{P}\mathsf{L}\mathsf{L}\mathsf{C}\mathsf{L}\mathsf{K}_{-}\mathsf{I}\mathsf{N}\times\mathsf{K}\times\mathsf{R}/\mathsf{P})\mathsf{\leq}110\mathsf{M}\mathsf{H}z$   
When the PLL is enabled and $\mathsf{D}\neq\mathsf{O}000$ , the following conditions must be satisfied to meet specified performance: 10 MHz ≤ PLLCLK _IN / P ≤ 20 MHz 80 MHz ≤ PLLCLK $\lvert N\times\mathsf{K}\times\mathsf{R}/\mathsf{P}\leq110\mathsf{M}\mathsf{H}z$ $4\leq\mathsf{J}\leq11$ ${\mathsf{R}}=1$  

# Example:  

$M C\mathsf{L K}=12\mathsf{N}$ Hz and Fsref $=44.1$ kHz Select ${\mathsf{P}}=1$ , ${\mathsf{R}}=1$ , $\mathsf{K}=7.5264$ , which results in $\mathsf{J}=7$ , $D=5264$  

# Example:  

$M C L K=12M H z$ and Fsref $\phantom{-}=48.0$ kHz Select ${\mathsf{P}}=1$ , ${\mathsf{R}}=1$ , $\mathsf{K}=8.192$ , which results in $\mathsf{J}=8$ , $\mathsf{D}=1920$  

The table below lists several example cases of typical MCLK rates and how to program the PLL to achieve Fsref $=44.1$ kHz or $48~\mathsf{k H z}$ .

The TLV320AIC32 includes a stereo audio ADC, which uses a delta-sigma modulator with 128-times oversampling in single-rate mode, followed by a digital decimation filter. The ADC supports sampling rates from 8 kHz to $48~\mathsf{k H z}$ in single-rate mode, and up to $96~\mathsf{k H z}$ in dual-rate mode. Whenever the ADC or DAC is in operation, the device requires an audio master clock be provided and appropriate audio clock generation be setup within the part.  

In order to provide optimal system power dissipation, the stereo ADC can be powered one channel at a time, to support the case where only mono record capability is required. In addition, both channels can be fully powered or entirely powered down.  

The integrated digital decimation filter removes high-frequency content and downsamples the audio data from an initial sampling rate of 128 Fs to the final output sampling rate of Fs. The decimation filter provides a linear phase output response with a group delay of 17/Fs. The $^{-3}$ dB bandwidth of the decimation filter extends to 0.45 Fs and scales with the sample rate (Fs). The filter has minimum 75dB attenuation over the stopband from 0.55 Fs to 64 Fs. Independent digital highpass filters are also included with each ADC channel, with a corner frequency that can be independently set to three different settings or can be disabled entirely.  

Because of the oversampling nature of the audio ADC and the integrated digital decimation filtering, requirements for analog anti-aliasing filtering are very relaxed. The TLV320AIC32 integrates a second order analog anti-aliasing filter with 20-dB attenuation at 1 MHz. This filter, combined with the digital decimation filter, provides sufficient anti-aliasing filtering without requiring additional external components.  

The ADC is preceded by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), which allows analog gain control from 0 dB to 59.5 dB in steps of 0.5 dB. The PGA gain changes are implemented with an internal soft-stepping algorithm that only changes the actual volume level by one 0.5-dB step every one or two ADC output samples, depending on the register programming (see registers Page-0/Reg-19 and 22). This soft-stepping ensures that volume control changes occur smoothly with no audible artifacts. On reset, the PGA gain defaults to a mute condition, and upon power down, the PGA soft-steps the volume to mute before shutting down. A read-only flag is set whenever the gain applied by PGA equals the desired value set by the register. The soft-stepping control can also be disabled by programming a register bit. When soft stepping is enabled, the audio master clock must be applied to the part after the ADC power down register is written to ensure the soft-stepping to mute has completed. When the ADC powerdown flag is no longer set, the audio master clock can be shut down.  

# AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL (AGC)  

An automatic gain control (AGC) circuit is included with the ADC and can be used to maintain nominally constant output signal amplitude when recording speech signals (it can be fully disabled if not desired). This circuitry automatically adjusts the PGA gain as the input signal becomes overly loud or very weak, such as when a person speaking into a microphone moves closer or farther from the microphone. The AGC algorithm has several programmable settings, including target gain, attack and decay time constants, noise threshold, and maximum PGA gain applicable that allow the algorithm to be fine tuned for any particular application. The algorithm uses the absolute average of the signal (which is the average of the absolute value of the signal) as a measure of the nominal amplitude of the output signal.  

Note that completely independent AGC circuitry is included with each ADC channel with entirely independent control over the algorithm from one channel to the next. This is attractive in cases where two microphones are used in a system, but may have different placement in the end equipment and require different dynamic performance for optimal system operation.  

Target gain represents the nominal output level at which the AGC attempts to hold the ADC output signal level. The TLV320AIC32 allows programming of eight different target gains, which can be programmed from $-5.5$ dB to –24 dB relative to a full-scale signal. Since the device reacts to the signal absolute average and not to peak levels, it is recommended that the larger gain be set with enough margin to avoid clipping at the occurrence of loud sounds.  

Attack time determines how quickly the AGC circuitry reduces the PGA gain when the input signal is too loud.   
can be varied from 8 ms to 20 ms.  

Decay time determines how quickly the PGA gain is increased when the input signal is too low. It can be varied in the range from 100 ms to $500~\mathrm{ms}$ .  

Noise gate threshold determines the level below which if the input speech average value falls, AGC considers it as a silence and hence brings down the gain to 0 dB in steps of 0.5 dB every FS and sets the noise threshold flag. The gain stays at 0 dB unless the input speech signal average rises above the noise threshold setting. This ensures that noise does not get gained up in the absence of speech. Noise threshold level in the AGC algorithm is programmable from $-30$ dB to $-90$ dB relative to full scale. A disable noise gate feature is also available. This operation includes programmable debounce and hysteresis functionality to avoid the AGC gain from cycling between high gain and 0 dB when signals are near the noise threshold level. When the noise threshold flag is set, the status of gain applied by the AGC and the saturation flag should be ignored.  

Maximum PGA gain applicable allows the user to restrict the maximum PGA gain that can be applied by the AGC algorithm. This can be used for limiting PGA gain in situations where environmental noise is greater than programmed noise threshold. It can be programmed from 0 dB to $+59.5$ dB in steps of 0.5 dB.

Figure 26. Typical Operation of the AGC Algorithm During Speech Recording  

Note that the time constants here are correct when the ADC is not in double-rate audio mode. The time constants are achieved using the Fsref value programmed in the control registers. However, if the Fsref is set in the registers to, for example, $48\mathsf{k H z}$ , but the actual audio clock or PLL programming actually results in a different Fsref in practice, then the time constants would not be correct.  

# STEREO AUDIO DAC  

The TLV320AIC32 includes a stereo audio DAC supporting sampling rates from 8 kHz to $96~\mathsf{k H z}$ . Each channel of the stereo audio DAC consists of a digital audio processing block, a digital interpolation filter, multi-bit digital delta-sigma modulator, and an analog reconstruction filter. The DAC is designed to provide enhanced performance at low sampling rates through increased oversampling and image filtering, thereby keeping quantization noise generated within the delta-sigma modulator and signal images strongly suppressed within the audio band to beyond $20~\mathsf{k H z}$ . This is realized by keeping the upsampled rate constant at $128\ \times$ Fsref and changing the oversampling ratio as the input sample rate is changed. For an Fsref of $48~\mathsf{k H z}$ , the digital delta-sigma modulator always operates at a rate of 6.144 MHz. This ensures that quantization noise generated within the delta-sigma modulator stays low within the frequency band below $20~\mathsf{k H z}$ at all sample rates. Similarly, for an Fsref rate of $44.1~\mathsf{k H z}$ , the digital delta-sigma modulator always operates at a rate of 5.6448 MHz.  

The following restrictions apply in the case when the PLL is powered down and double-rate audio mode is enabled in the DAC.  

Allowed Q values $=4$ , 8, 9, 12, 16 Q values where equivalent Fsref can be achieved by turning on PLL $\mathsf Q=5$ , 6, 7 (set $\mathsf{P}=5/6/7$ and ${\sf K}=16.0$ and PLL enabled) $\mathsf Q=10$ , 14 (set ${\mathsf{P}}=5$ , 7 and $\mathsf{K}=8.0$ and PLL enabled)  

# DIGITAL AUDIO PROCESSING  

The DAC channel consists of optional filters for de-emphasis and bass, treble, midrange level adjustment, speaker equalization, and 3-D effects processing. The de-emphasis function is implemented by a programmable digital filter block with fully programmable coefficients (see Page-1/Reg-21-26 for left channel, Page-1/Reg-47-52 for right channel). If de-emphasis is not required in a particular application, this programmable filter block can be used for some other purpose. The de-emphasis filter transfer function is given by:  

$$
{\sf H}(z)=\frac{{\sf N}0+{\sf N}1\times z^{-1}}{32768-{\sf D}1\times z^{-1}}
$$  

where the N0, N1, and D1 coefficients are fully programmable individually for each channel. The coefficients that should be loaded to implement standard de-emphasis filters are given in Table 2.  

Table 2. De-Emphasis Coefficients for Common Audio Sampling Rates

(1) Default De-emphasis Coeffiicients  

In addition to the de-emphasis filter block, the DAC digital effects processing includes a fourth order digital IIR filter with programmable coefficients (one set per channel). This filter is implemented as cascade of two biquad sections with frequency response given by:  

$$
\bigg(\frac{\mathsf{N}0+2\times\mathsf{N}1\times z^{-1}+\mathsf{N}2\times z^{-2}}{32768-2\times\mathsf{D}1\times z^{-1}-\mathsf{D}2\times z^{-2}}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{\mathsf{N}3+2\times\mathsf{N}4\times z^{-1}+\mathsf{N}5\times z^{-2}}{32768-2\times\mathsf{D}4\times z^{-1}-\mathsf{D}5\times z^{-2}}\bigg)
$$  

The $\mathsf{N}$ and D coefficients are fully programmable, and the entire filter can be enabled or bypassed. The structure of the filtering when configured for independent channel processing is shown below in Figure 27, with LB1 corresponding to the first left-channel biquad filter using coefficients N0, N1, N2, D1, and D2. LB2 similarly corresponds to the second left-channel biquad filter using coefficients N3, N4, N5, D4, and D5. The RB1 and RB2 filters refer to the first and second right-channel biquad filters, respectively.

Figure 27. Structure of the Digital Effects Processing for Independent Channel Processing  

The coefficients for this filter implement a variety of sound effects, with bass-boost or treble boost being the most commonly used in portable audio applications. The default $\mathsf{N}$ and $\mathsf{D}$ coefficients in the part are given in Table 3 and implement a shelving filter with 0-dB gain from DC to approximately $150~\mathsf{H z}$ , at which point it rolls off to a 3-dB attenuation for higher frequency signals, thus giving a 3-dB boost to signals below $150~\mathsf{H z}$ . The N and D coefficients are represented by 16-bit two’s complement numbers with values ranging from –32768 to 32767.

The digital processing also includes capability to implement 3-D processing algorithms by providing means to process the mono mix of the stereo input, and then combine this with the individual channel signals for stereo output playback. The architecture of this processing mode, and the programmable filters available for use in the system, is shown in Figure 28. Note that the programmable attenuation block provides a method of adjusting the level of 3-D effect introduced into the final stereo output. This combined with the fully programmable biquad filters in the system enables the user to fully optimize the audio effects for a particular system and provide extensive differentiation from other systems using the same device.  

![](images/64a3f9356c58bce5d72e500f896143f602e104cdf8a8540f4181a71a905767dd.jpg)  
Figure 28. Architecture of the Digital Audio Processing When 3-D Effects are Enabled  

It is recommended that the digital effects filters should be disabled while the filter coefficients are being modified. While new coefficients are being written to the device over the control port, it is possible that a filter using partially updated coefficients may actually implement an unstable system and lead to oscillation or objectionable audio output. By disabling the filters, changing the coefficients, and then re-enabling the filters, these types of effects can be entirely avoided.  

# DIGITAL INTERPOLATION FILTER  

The digital interpolation filter upsamples the output of the digital audio processing block by the required oversampling ratio before data is provided to the digital delta-sigma modulator and analog reconstruction filter stages. The filter provides a linear phase output with a group delay of 21/Fs. In addition, programmable digital interpolation filtering is included to provide enhanced image filtering and reduce signal images caused by the upsampling process that are below $20~\mathsf{k H z}$ . For example, upsampling an 8-kHz signal produces signal images at multiples of 8-kHz (i.e., 8 kHz, 16 kHz, $24\mathsf{k H z}$ , etc.). The images at 8 kHz and $16k H z$ are below $20k H z$ and still audible to the listener; therefore, they must be filtered heavily to maintain a good quality output. The interpolation filter is designed to maintain at least 65-dB rejection of images that land below 7.455 Fs. In order to utilize the programmable interpolation capability, the Fsref should be programmed to a higher rate (restricted to be in the range of $39~\mathsf{k H z}$ to $53k\mathsf{H}z$ when the PLL is in use), and the actual Fs is set using the NDAC divider. For example, if $\mathsf{F s}=8\mathsf{k H z}$ is required, then Fsref can be set to $48~\mathsf{k H z}$ , and the DAC Fs set to Fsref/6. This ensures that all images of the 8-kHz data are sufficiently attenuated well beyond a 20-kHz audible frequency range.  

# DELTA-SIGMA AUDIO DAC  

The stereo audio DAC incorporates a third order multi-bit delta-sigma modulator followed by an analog reconstruction filter. The DAC provides high-resolution, low-noise performance, using oversampling and noise shaping techniques. The analog reconstruction filter design consists of a 6-tap analog FIR filter followed by a continuous time RC filter. The analog FIR operates at a rate of $128\times$ Fsref (6.144 MHz when Fsref $=48~{\mathsf{k H z}}$ , 5.6448 MHz when Fsref $=44.1\ \mathsf{k H z}\bar{)}$ . Note that the DAC analog performance may be degraded by excessive clock jitter on the MCLK input. Therefore, care must be taken to keep jitter on this clock to a minimum.  

# AUDIO DAC DIGITAL VOLUME CONTROL  

The audio DAC includes a digital volume control block which implements a programmable digital gain. The volume level can be varied from 0 dB to $-63.5$ dB in 0.5-dB steps, in addition to a mute bit, independently for each channel. The volume level of both channels can also be changed simultaneously by the master volume control. Gain changes are implemented with a soft-stepping algorithm, which only changes the actual volume by one step per input sample, either up or down, until the desired volume is reached. The rate of soft-stepping can be slowed to one step per two input samples through a register bit.  

Because of soft-stepping, the host does not know when the DAC has been actually muted. This may be important if the host wishes to mute the DAC before making a significant change, such as changing sample rates. In order to help with this situation, the device provides a flag back to the host via a read-only register bit that alerts the host when the part has completed the soft-stepping and the actual volume has reached the desired volume level. The soft-stepping feature can be disabled through register programming. If soft-stepping is enabled, the MCLK signal should be kept applied to the device until the DAC power-down flag is set. When this flag is set, the internal soft-stepping process and power down sequence is complete, and the MCLK can then be stopped if desired.  

The TLV320AIC32 also includes functionality to detect when the user switches on or off the de-emphasis or digital audio processing functions, to first (1) soft-mute the DAC volume control, (2) change the operation of the digital effects processing, and (3) soft-unmute the part. This avoids any possible pop/clicks in the audio output due to instantaneous changes in the filtering. A similar algorithm is used when first powering up or down the DAC. The circuit begins operation at power up with the volume control muted, then soft-steps it up to the desired volume level. At power down, the logic first soft-steps the volume down to a mute level, then powers down the circuitry.  

# ANALOG OUTPUT COMMON-MODE ADJUSTMENT  

The output common-mode voltage and output range of the analog output are determined by an internal bandgap reference, in contrast to other codecs that may use a divided version of the supply. This scheme is used to reduce the coupling of noise that may be on the supply (such as 217-Hz noise in a GSM cellphone) into the audio signal path.  

However, due to the possible wide variation in analog supply range (2.7 V – 3.6 V), an output common-mode voltage setting of $1.35\mathrm{V}$ , which would be used for a $2.7\:\forall$ supply case, will be overly conservative if the supply is actually much larger, such as $3.3\ V$ or $3.6\vee$ . In order to optimize device operation, the TLV320AIC32 includes a programmable output common-mode level, which can be set by register programming to a level most appropriate to the actual supply range used by a particular customer. The output common-mode level can be varied among four different values, ranging from 1.35 V (most appropriate for low supply ranges, near 2.7 V) to $1.8~\mathsf{V}$ (most appropriate for high supply ranges, near 3.6 V). Note that there is also some limitation on the range of DVDD voltage as well in determining which setting is most appropriate.

# AUDIO DAC POWER CONTROL  

The stereo DAC can be fully powered up or down, and in addition, the analog circuitry in each DAC channel can be powered up or down independently. This provides power savings when only a mono playback stream is needed.  

# AUDIO ANALOG INPUTS  

The TLV320AIC3105 includes six single-ended audio inputs. These pins connect through series resistors and switches to the virtual ground terminals of two fully differential opamps (one per ADC/PGA channel). By selecting to turn on only one set of switches per opamp at a time, the inputs can be effectively muxed to each ADC PGA channel.  

By selecting to turn on multiple sets of switches per opamp at a time, mixing can also be achieved. Mixing of multiple inputs can easily lead to PGA outputs that exceed the range of the internal opamps, resulting in saturation and clipping of the mixed output signal. Whenever mixing is being implemented, the user should take adequate precautions to avoid such a saturation case from occurring. In general, the mixed signal should not exceed 2 Vp-p (single-ended).  

In most mixing applications, there is also a general need to adjust the levels of the individual signals being mixed. For example, if a soft signal and a large signal are to be mixed and played together, the soft signal generally should be amplified to a level comparable to the large signal before mixing. In order to accommodate this need, the TLV320AIC3105 includes input level control on each of the individual inputs before they are mixed or muxed into the ADC PGAs, with gain programmable from 0 dB to –12 dB in 1.5 dB steps. Note that this input level control is not intended to be a volume control, but instead used occasionally for level setting. Soft-stepping of the input level control settings is implemented in this device, with the speed and functionality following the settings used by the ADC PGA for soft-stepping.  

Figure 29 shows the single-ended mixing configuration for the left channel ADC PGA, which enables mixing of the signals LINE1L, LINE2L, LINE1R, MIC3L, and MIC3R. The right channel ADC PGA mix is similar, enabling mixing of the signals LINE1R, LINE2R, LINE1L, MIC3L, and MIC3R.

# ANALOG INPUT BYPASS PATH FUNCTIONALITY  

The TLV320AIC3105 includes the additional ability to route some analog input signals past the integrated data converters, for mixing with other analog signals and then direction connection to the output drivers. This capability is useful in a cellphone, for example, when a separate FM radio device provides a stereo analog output signal that needs to be routed to headphones. The TLV320AIC3105 supports this in a low power mode by providing a direct analog path through the device to the output drivers, while all ADCs and DACs can be completely powered down to save power. When programmed correctly, the device can pass the signal LINE2L and LINE2R to the output stage directly.  

# ADC PGA SIGNAL BYPASS PATH FUNCTIONALITY  

In addition to the input bypass path described above, the TLV320AIC32 also includes the ability to route the ADC PGA output signals past the ADC, for mixing with other analog signals and then direction connection to the output drivers. These bypass functions are described in more detail in the sections on output mixing and output driver configurations.  

# INPUT IMPEDANCE AND VCM CONTROL  

The TLV320AIC32 includes several programmable settings to control analog input pins, particularly when they are not selected for connection to an ADC PGA. The default option allows unselected inputs to be put into a tri-state condition, such that the input impedance seen looking into the device is extremely high. Note, however, that the pins on the device do include protection diode circuits connected to AVDD and AVSS. Thus, if any voltage is driven onto a pin approximately one diode drop $(\sim0.6\lor)$ above AVDD or one diode drop below AVSS, these protection diodes will begin conducting current, resulting in an effective impedance that no longer appears as a tri-state condition.  

Another programmable option for unselected analog inputs is to weakly hold them at the common-mode input voltage of the ADC PGA (which is determined by an internal bandgap voltage reference). This is useful to keep the ac-coupling capacitors connected to analog inputs biased up at a normal DC level, thus avoiding the need for them to charge up suddenly when the input is changed from being unselected to selected for connection to an ADC PGA. This option is controlled in Page-0/Reg-20 and 23. The user should ensure this option is disabled when an input is selected for connection to an ADC PGA or selected for the analog input bypass path, since it can corrupt the recorded input signal if left operational when an input is selected.  

In most cases, the analog input pins on the TLV320AIC32 should be ac-coupled to analog input sources, the only exception to this generally being if an ADC is being used for DC voltage measurement. The ac-coupling capacitor will cause a highpass filter pole to be inserted into the analog signal path, so the size of the capacitor must be chosen to move that filter pole sufficiently low in frequency to cause minimal effect on the processed analog signal. The input impedance of the analog inputs when selected for connection to an ADC PGA varies with the setting of the input level control, starting at approximately $20~\mathsf{k}\Omega$ with an input level control setting of 0-dB, and increasing to approximately $80\mathrm{-}\mathsf{k}\Omega$ when the input level control is set at $-12$ dB. For example, using a $0.1~\upmu\mathsf{F}$ ac-coupling capacitor at an analog input will result in a highpass filter pole of $80~{\mathsf{H}}z$ when the 0 dB input level control setting is selected.  

# PASSIVE ANALOG BYPASS DURING POWER DOWN  

Programming the TLV320AIC3105 to passive analog bypass occurs by configuring the output stage switches for passthrough. This is done by opening switches SW-L0, SW-R0 and closing either SW-L1 or SW-L2 and SW-R1 or SW-R2. See Figure 30. Programming this mode is done by writing to page 0, register 108.  

Connecting the MIC1L/LINE1L input signal to LEFT_LOP is done by closing SW-L1 and opening SW-L0; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D0. Connecting the MIC2L/LINE2L input signal to LEFT_LOP is done by closing SW-L2 and opening SW-L0; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D2.  

Connecting the MIC1R/LINE1R input signal to RIGHT_LOP is done by closing SW-R1 and opening SW-R0; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D4. Connecting the MIC2R/LINE2R input signal to RIGHT_LOP is done by closing SW-R2 and opening SW-R0; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D6. A diagram of the passive analog bypass mode configuration can be seen in Figure 30.  

In general, connecting two switches to the same output pin should be avoided, as this error shorts two input signals together, which would likely cause distortion of the signal as the two signal are in contention. Poor frequency response would also likely occur.

Figure 30. Passive Analog Bypass Mode Configuration  

# MICBIAS GENERATION  

The TLV320AIC32 includes a programmable microphone bias output voltage (MICBIAS), capable of providing output voltages of $2.0\:\vee$ or $2.5\vee$ (both derived from the on-chip bandgap voltage) with $4{\cdot}{\mathsf{m A}}$ output current drive. In addition, the MICBIAS may be programmed to be switched to AVDD directly through an on-chip switch, or it can be powered down completely when not needed, for power savings. This function is controlled by register programming in Page-0/Reg-25.  

# ANALOG FULLY DIFFERENTIAL LINE OUTPUT DRIVERS  

The TLV320AIC32 has two fully differential line output drivers, each capable of driving a 10-kΩ differential load. The output stage design leading to the fully differential line output drivers is shown in Figure 31 and Figure 32. This design includes extensive capability to adjust signal levels independently before any mixing occurs, beyond that already provided by the PGA gain and the DAC digital volume control.  

The LINE2L/R signals refer to the signals that travel through the analog input bypass path to the output stage. The PGA_L/R signals refer to the outputs of the ADC PGA stages that are similarly passed around the ADC to the output stage. Note that since both left and right channel signals are routed to all output drivers, a mono mix of any of the stereo signals can easily be obtained by setting the volume controls of both left and right channel signals to $^{-6}$ dB and mixing them. Undesired signals can also be disconnected from the mix as well through register control.

Figure 32. Detail of the Volume Control and Mixing Function Shown in Figure 25 and Figure 16  

The DAC_L/R signals are the outputs of the stereo audio DAC, which can be steered by register control based on the requirements of the system. If mixing of the DAC audio with other signals is not required, and the DAC output is only needed at the stereo line outputs, then it is recommended to use the routing through path DAC_L3/R3 to the fully differential stereo line outputs. This results not only in higher quality output performance, but also in lower power operation, since the analog volume controls and mixing blocks ahead of these drivers can be powered down. This signal path will attenuate the signal by a factor of 1 dB.  

If instead the DAC analog output must be routed to multiple output drivers simultaneously (such as to LEFT_LOP/M and RIGHT_LOP/M) or must be mixed with other analog signals, then the DAC outputs should be switched through the DAC_L1/R1 path. This option provides the maximum flexibility for routing of the DAC analog signals to the output drivers  

The TLV320AIC32 includes an output level control on each output driver with limited gain adjustment from 0 dB to 9 dB. The output driver circuitry in this device are designed to provide a low distortion output while playing fullscale stereo DAC signals at a 0dB gain setting. However, a higher amplitude output can be obtained at the cost of increased signal distortion at the output. This output level control allows the user to make this tradeoff based on the requirements of the end equipment. Note that this output level control is not intended to be used as a standard output volume control. It is expected to be used only sparingly for level setting, i.e., adjustment of the fullscale output range of the device.  

Each differential line output driver can be powered down independently of the others when it is not needed in the system. When placed into powerdown through register programming, the driver output pins will be placed into a tri-stated, high-impedance state.  

# ANALOG HIGH POWER OUTPUT DRIVERS  

The TLV320AIC32 includes four high power output drivers with extensive flexibility in their usage. These output drivers are individually capable of driving $30~\mathsf{m}\mathsf{W}$ each into a $16-\Omega$ load in single-ended configuration, and they can be used in pairs to drive up to $500~\mathsf{m}\mathsf{W}$ into an 8-Ω load connected in bridge-terminated load (BTL) configuration between two driver outputs.  

The high power output drivers can be configured in a variety of ways, including:  

1. driving up to two fully differential output signals   
2. driving up to four single-ended output signals   
3. driving two single-ended output signals, with one or two of the remaining drivers driving a fixed VCM level,   
for a pseudo-differential stereo output   
4. driving one or two $^{8-\Omega}$ speakers connected BTL between pairs of driver output pins  

5. driving stereo headphones in single-ended configuration with two drivers, while the remaining two drivers are connected in BTL configuration to an 8-Ω speaker.  

The output stage architecture leading to the high power output drivers is shown in Figure 33, with the volume control and mixing blocks being effectively identical to that shown in Figure 32. Note that each of these drivers have a output level control block like those included with the line output drivers, allowing gain adjustment up to $+9{\mathsf{d B}}$ on the output signal. As in the previous case, this output level adjustment is not intended to be used as a standard volume control, but instead is included for additional fullscale output signal level control.  

Two of the output drivers, HPROUT and HPLOUT, include a direct connection path for the stereo DAC outputs to be passed directly to the output drivers and bypass the analog volume controls and mixing networks, using the DAC_L2/R2 path. As in the line output case, this functionality provides the highest quality DAC playback performance with reduced power dissipation, but can only be utilized if the DAC output does not need to route to multiple output drivers simultaneously, and if mixing of the DAC output with other analog signals is not needed. The direct connection path will attenuate the signal by a factor of 1 dB.

Figure 33. Architecture of the output stage leading to the high power output drivers  

The high power output drivers include additional circuitry to avoid artifacts on the audio output during power-on and power-off transient conditions. The user should first program the type of output configuration being used in Page-0/Reg-14, to allow the device to select the optimal power-up scheme to avoid output artifacts. The power-up delay time for the high power output drivers is also programmable over a wide range of time delays, from instantaneous up to 4-sec, using Page-0/Reg-42.  

When these output drivers are powered down, they can be placed into a variety of output conditions based on register programming. If lowest power operation is desired, then the outputs can be placed into a tri-state condition, and all power to the output stage is removed. However, this generally results in the output nodes drifting to rest near the upper or lower analog supply, due to small leakage currents at the pins. This then results in a longer delay requirement to avoid output artifacts during driver power-on. In order to reduce this required power-on delay, the TLV320AIC32 includes an option for the output pins of the drivers to be weakly driven to the VCM level they would normally rest at when powered with no signal applied. This output VCM level is determined by an internal bandgap voltage reference, and thus results in extra power dissipation when the drivers are in powerdown. However, this option provides the fastest method for transitioning the drivers from powerdown to full power operation without any output artifact introduced.  

The device includes a further option that falls between the other two – while it requires less power drawn while the output drivers are in powerdown, it also takes a slightly longer delay to power-up without artifact than if the bandgap reference is kept alive. In this alternate mode, the powered-down output driver pin is weakly driven to a voltage of approximately half the DRVDD1/2 supply level using an internal voltage divider. This voltage will not match the actual VCM of a fully powered driver, but due to the output voltage being close to its final value, a much shorter power-up delay time setting can be used and still avoid any audible output artifacts. These output voltage options are controlled in Page-0/Reg-42.  

The high power output drivers can also be programmed to power up first with the output level control in a highly attenuated state, then the output driver will automatically slowly reduce the output attenuation to reach the desired output level setting programmed. This capability is enabled by default and can be controlled by Page-0/Reg-40.  

# SHORT CIRCUIT OUTPUT PROTECTION  

The TLV320AIC32 includes programmable short-circuit protection for the high power output drivers, for maximum flexibility in a given application. By default, if these output drivers are shorted, they will automatically limit the maximum amount of current that can be sourced to or sunk from a load, thereby protecting the device from an over-current condition. In this mode, the user can read Page-0/Reg-95 to determine whether the part is in short-circuit protection or not, and then decide whether to program the device to power down the output drivers. However, the device includes further capability to automatically power down an output driver whenever it does into short-circuit protection, without requiring intervention from the user. In this case, the output driver will stay in a power down condition until the user specifically programs it to power down and then power back up again, to clear the short-circuit flag.  

# CONTROL REGISTERS  

The control registers for the TLV320AIC32 are described in detail below. All registers are 8 bit in width, with D7 referring to the most significant bit of each register, and D0 referring to the least significant bit.

# Output Stage Volume Controls  

A basic analog volume control with range from 0 dB to -78 dB and mute is replicated multiple times in the output stage network, connected to each of the analog signals that route to the output stage. In addition, to enable completely independent mixing operations to be performed for each output driver, each analog signal coming into the output stage may have up to seven separate volume controls. These volume controls all have approximately 0.5-dB step programmability over most of the gain range, with steps increasing slightly at the lowest attenuations. Table 5 lists the detailed gain versus programmed setting for this basic volume control.
