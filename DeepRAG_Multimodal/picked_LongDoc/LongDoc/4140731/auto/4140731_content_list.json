Mercia had its own distinctive art of high quality, the Tiberius school of manuscripts, including the Book of Cerne and the Barberini Gospels and an influential style of metalwork, including the elegant Trewhiddle style of silver jewellery, that spread across England.

The role of nature as the source of wealth and sustainer of life is emphasised.

It’s a movement system arising from an instinctive response to musical stimuli, based on the observation of natural   \nmovements of the spine in everyday life.

There is strong evidence that the Health Qigong, which was developed and widely practised in China, greatly improves general health of those who regularly practise it. In modern times it has become very popular for fitness purposes. Qigong is particularly beneficial, improving posture, balance, breathing effectiveness and general coordination, as well as mental focus and relaxation, helping older people make the most of their mature years. The course does not require any previous knowledge and all exercises are done standing. No equipment needed, just wearing clothing and thin exercise shoes or socks. ",

The first step after that is the ancestral languages identified in the eighteenth century, with a focus on our Indo-European group. The journey takes in all the significant languages once spoken in Britain: Celtic variants, forms of Latin, Germanic tribal dialects, Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse and Norman French. Diversions include the development of punctuation, runes, regional dialects and foreign infiltrations into modern English. Evidence from place names, history and literature is examined. At the end of the journey we consider the international significance of English and the evolution of the language in our lifetimes.

The book's diminished subject matter, along with its employment of the epiphany (a term coined by Joyce), and its deliberate lack of evident authorial intrusion which allows its characters inadvertently to reveal their truths, marked the beginning of a new style in twentieth-century literature. Joyce evidently conceived of the Irish as his primary readers for Dubliners, and these Irish readers were the inhabitants of a particular historical context - the early twentieth-century Dublin of Joyce's youth. Joyce intended Dubliners to be realistic and revelatory. The course will consider Dubliners' innovations of style and substance, studying the individual stories against the background of the context of the Ireland he so uncompromisingly addressed in the struggle for what he termed 'the spiritual liberation of my country'. The required course reading is Dubliners (Penguin Modern Classics, 2000). ",

Originating in an artistic and intellectual project that sought to revive the pairing of music and drama in ancient Greece, Monteverdi's operas unsurprisingly base their plots on legendary and historical personalities, notably Orpheus, Ulysses, and Nero. The message however is endlessly familiar: humans are at the mercy of forces beyond their control. How   \nMonteverdi presents this in music is the question for us to consider.

Philosophy is not really about armchair reasoning - it is a living skill.  However, in order that we may acquire that skill it is useful to look at how logicians have applied it in the past. Great minds, from Plato to Wittgenstein, have helped to show us the way to relate philosophy to every aspect of our lives. An introduction to simple formal logic, which can be applied to help with correct reasoning and hence clear thinking, will assist us in exposing fallacies in the   \nstatements and reasoning of others, whether in casual, friendly conversation or the serious attempts of advertisers, politicians and public figures to influence our thought.   \nFlawed and false arguments abound and in this course we try to show ways to untangle them.

Finally, the drunken gate-crasher   \nAlcibiades bursts in, and praises Socrates himself as the object of love. You will need the Penguin Classics   \ntranslation by Christopher Gill. We will read the book   \ntogether. I shall provide a running philosophical   \ncommentary and facilitate discussion. We will also read (and consider) C. S. Lewis' masterpiece \"The Four Loves\", an exploration of how having four different words for \"love\" (as Greek has) helps reduce the confusion which Englishspeakers fall into, with just the one word. You will need a copy of this book, too. ",

Photography lives, and has always lived, in a world of influences and challenges to which it responds and on which it, in turn, has an impact.  Its story and current   \npractice reflect debates around issues such as equality, exploitation, censorship and interpretations of history. Usually those matters are expressed through the   \nphotographs; sometimes they are expressed through the lives of the photographers. This course will explore these relationships in five sessions covering: ideas that changed photography; photographs that changed the world; women in photography; travellers, exploration and photography; and photographic controversy and the bounds of   \nacceptability (will include pictures that some may find   \noffensive).

Are we receiving a balance of views,   \nincluding from others who take a contrary position when analysing the data? Some of the data and conclusions reached will be presented and discussed. Political attempts to limit emissions, generated by the burning of fossil fuels, include policies with far-reaching economic consequences (e.g. in energy sources, energy usage, and power   \ngeneration). What are these policies hoping to achieve, and can they be successful?  Alternative views to the orthodoxy will be presented, based on the work of acclaimed   \nscientists in the field, and data from official organisations. Time will be allocated for discussion. ",

As a result, British geologists pioneered or ‘colonised’ vast stretches of geological time with British names such as Cambrian and Devonian. William Smith’s 1817 geological section from North Wales to London, roughly along the route of the Irish Mails, was the first to represent the   \nsuccession of strata that preserve a good sample of the last 550 million years of geological time.

It's difficult to do most advanced physics without advanced mathematics, but there is an exception. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote a paper (often called EPR) showing that the prevailing   \ninterpretation of quantum mechanics was inconsistent with reality. In 1964, the Irish physicist John Bell generalised their idea and framed it as a simple experimentally testable equation. The result of the experiment was \"Quantum Mechanics - 1: Reality - 0\".  EPR's concept of reality was shown to be incorrect. The worrying thing is that this   \nincorrect concept might be summed up as \"Things have properties\".  After a quick review of quantum mechanics, photons, and polarization, we'll dive into EPR, Bell's work, Aspect's experiments, and their implications. The concepts here are very challenging but fortunately the maths is relatively easy, trigonometry and probability. ",

It can bring many important benefits: less anxiety, greater awareness, better concentration, and a more sensitive understanding of oneself and others. Meditation has recently become influential in the West as an effective method for dealing with the pressures and difficulties of living. It has been practised for 2500 years as a central aspect of the Buddhist tradition, although the course does not assume Buddhist or any other beliefs. The course is practice-based: it focuses on setting up a regular meditation practice and introduces two basic methods, based on awareness of the breath and on the cultivation of kindness.

The value of investments is allocated in proportion to member's accumulated subscriptions. Membership is not a short term commitment, nor is it a source of investment advice.  Investments are purchased from members' monthly subscriptions of £50 per month (paid by standing order) and there is a nonrefundable joining fee of £50 to cover the significant administration costs.   Members must have some knowledge of investments in general and the stock market in particular.  Prospective members are expected to attend at least 2 meetings before joining.  We will continue with Hybrid Zoom when post-Covid. For further information, please contact the Organiser - Eddie Hatfield.  Contact the U3AC Office to register your interest in joining the club. ",
