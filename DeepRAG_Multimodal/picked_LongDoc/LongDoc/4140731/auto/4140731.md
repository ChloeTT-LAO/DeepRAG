# General information  

# About U3AC  

University of the Third Age in Cambridge (U3AC) is a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) that organises educational, social and fitness activities for people who are not, or no longer, in full-time employment (there are no age restrictions). Our website, www.u3ac.org.uk, gives full details of the organisation – how we are run, our history, our constitution, policies and our annual report and accounts. It is the place to go for up-to-date information about our courses, lectures, social and cultural activities, privacy policy, public liability insurance etc.  

# The annual subscription  

The annual subscription for 2021–2022 is £95. New members pay an additional enrolment fee of £5. A reduced rate subscription is available for members in receipt of pension credit. To qualify for the reduced subscription of $20\%$ of the full rate (£19), contact the Office with evidence of your entitlement. If you enrol online, you will be refunded the difference when the relevant documentation has been received. The annual membership subscription contributes to the administration and accommodation costs of U3AC and is non-refundable. It is not a payment for individual classes, lectures or activities.  

# Applying for courses  

For existing members  

Applications should be submitted via the website, www.u3ac.org.uk, no later than 13 August. lease note: If you apply for only one course, and that course has a limited number of places, we canno guarantee that you will be allocated a place. It is therefore advisable to list an alternative.  

1. Log on to the website using your username and password (if you have forgotten your password, click Forgotten Password).   
2. Click 'Course selection'. Select the courses you want to apply for. You can choose a maximum of 6: Make sure their times do not clash. If two are on the same day, ensure that you have time to get from one to the next. Rank your courses in order of preference with your first choice at the top of the list. You can change the order of preference by dragging the courses you have selected up and down the list.   
3. If you wish, enter an alternative course in the right-hand column. The alternative should be either: similar to the course in the first column and you don’t mind which one you attend, including the same course which is offered both on Zoom and face-to-face or at the same time as the course in the first column.   
4. Click the ‘Submit course choices’ button at the bottom of the screen.   
5. Pay the annual subscription, and any additional course fees via PayPal, using your credit card or debit card (you do not need to have a PayPal account).   
6. Once payment has been made via PayPal you will be taken back to the U3AC website to complete the payment and submit your application.  

For new members  

You must first register on the website and set up your account:  

1. Click Join U3AC on the homepage.   
2. Complete the two parts of the online registration form (‘Your info’ and ‘Additional Information’). Don’t forget to click the Submit button at the bottom of the Additional Information form.   
3. Then apply for up to 6 courses, as described in steps 2–6 for existing members above.  

Any existing or new member who needs help completing the online form, should telephone the Office on 01223 321587 and a member of staff will be pleased to talk you through the process.  

If you do not have access to the internet, the Office can send you a paper copy of the New member registration and course application form.  

When to apply  

You can join U3AC at any time and apply for courses. If your course choices are submitted by 13 August, they will be included in the annual allocation process, which uses a computer algorithm. If they are submitted after the allocation process, some courses will be full, so it is best to check first with the Office. If you have made your application by 13 August, you will be sent your membership card in September, with a list of the courses on which you have a place.  

The vacancy list, available from September, shows courses that still have vacancies. If you apply for a course that is full, you will be placed on the waiting list.  

# Course allocation  

The computer algorithm used to allocate courses works as follows:  

1. It finds all members who have placed a particular course as their first choice.   
2. If there are more applicants than places on the course, the algorithm selects names at random from the list of applicants.   
3. If the course still has empty places, applications from members who put it as their second choice are considered, and so on.   
4. If you are not allocated a place on your chosen course, your name is added to the waiting list, unless you have listed an alternative course in the second column. In this case the alternative course will be substituted for the course in the first column and you will not be put on the waiting list.   
5. To make the course allocation more evenly balanced, the algorithm holds a ‘success number’ for each member. This is initially set to zero. Each time a member is allocated a place on a course, their success number increases by 1. Members who have a lower success number (i.e. have not been allocated their first choice of course, or their alternative first choice) are given priority in the allocation of second choice courses, and so are more likely to get these.  

Once you have received your confirmation letter and membership card you may start to attend courses. Please note: The Courses Committee reserves the right to cancel courses whose enrolments fail to reach $50\%$ of the allocated capacity.  

# Attending courses  

Health and safety  

Participation in all U3AC activities is at your own risk.  

Before taking a fitness course or other physical activity, please consider whether you should consult your GP.   
If you have a significant health concern, please mention this (in confidence) to the course tutor or organiser.  

If you are attending a class in the U3AC premises, let Office staff know if you require help should the premises need to be evacuated in an emergency by ticking the box on the application form.  

Members with special needs  

Many courses can be adapted to cater for members with visual or hearing impairments. Please discuss your needs with the course tutor or organiser.   
A table on pages 87 and 88 of this Programme and the course venues page on the website give details of each venue’s facilities and accessibility.  

Withdrawing from a course  

If you are not able to attend a course, or if you find it does not meet your needs, let the Office know as soon as possible so your place can be offered to someone on the waiting list.  

# Contacting a tutor  

For data protection reasons, the tutor’s personal details are not printed in the Programme of Courses.   
Instead, they are available to members who are logged in to the website.  

Log in in the usual way and go to the course description page. The contact details are listed under the tutor’s description. • If you do not have internet access you can request this information from the Office.

# Insurance  

U3AC’s insurance policy includes cover for public liability, that is U3AC’s liability for accidental injury or damage to property which occurs at our premises or in the external venues we hire for some of our activities. This covers members and those working on our behalf as volunteers while in our premises or in such external venues. Where a course is held in a member’s home, our public liability insurance covers only losses directly attributable to the activities outlined in the course description given in the Programme of Courses.  

Our public liability also extends to excursions and trips organised by U3AC’s Social and Cultural Activities Committee and to any trip forming part of a course description.  

Please note that we accept liability only for activities formally provided by U3AC and accepted by our insurer. For other informal activities or trips abroad, individual members should have appropriate household or travel insurance.  

Please contact the Office (office@u3ac.org.uk) if you have any questions about public liability insurance for an activity you may organise or if you wish to see a copy of the policy document.  

# Volunteering  

U3AC is very much run by its members for its members, and there is a continuing need for help with our activities. In particular, we are always looking for members who are willing to teach a course or lead a group. Other members arrange visits to museums, galleries, theatres and concerts, and occasionally organise short trips in this country and longer trips abroad. Established members may wish to consider joining the U3AC Council.  

Please indicate on your application form if you would like to volunteer in any way.  

# Art  

# ART 01: Abstract art  

Coordinators: Andrew Grimmer, Simon Draper, Gregor   
Alvey, Maggie Balshaw & Brian Mitchell   
Day and time: Friday 10:10 - 12:10   
Venue: Castle Street Methodist Church (Hall)   
Length of course: 2 terms. Autumn (10 weeks), Spring (10   
weeks)  

Places: 24  

Start date: 15 Oct  

Participants are encouraged to experiment and enjoy this socially interactive group. A highlight of ART 01 has been the ethos of collaboration and open mindedness. This has created a forum free of pressure that everyone thoroughly enjoys. Although there is no formal tuition, we will give guidance and set out a programme of, in the main, twoweekly sessions each dealing with a specific theme. We plan to arrange break-out sessions on specific techniques including digital art.  When you feel confident you may like to take a lead sharing techniques in a session. You can work in any medium (except oils), bringing your own materials and equipment. If, unfortunately, we have to return to 'virtual' classes we have proved this can be done successfully.  

Format: Course or activity without teaching About us: The organisers, in addition to their experience in the world of art, have varied backgrounds encompassing education, science, and music.  

# ART 03: Back to basics 1. An introduction to drawing and painting  

# ART 02: Anything goes: exploring representational and abstract forms

This course will offer a loose structure for members to explore/develop their favourite mediums and art forms. Words/music/themes/existing works of art and art movements will be used to stimulate creative artwork. Class members will gain most from the sessions if they prepare for their interpretations of the themes as homework, as the topic will be given at least a week in advance of the class. The choice of mediums to be used will be that of the class members. Advice will be offered about suitable mediums for chosen subjects. The course will be most suited to previous participants in 'Anything goes', but others are also welcome. Course members will be expected to reflect on their work and the processes that go into producing it in joint discussion and critique.  

Format: Practical activities and discussions

# Art history  

# ARTH 02(z): Looking at art: 1300-1600 (Spring term)  

# ARTH 01: Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia (Spring term)  

Tutor: Diane Milan   
Day and time: Friday 09:30 - 10:30   
Venue: U3AC (Pink room)   
Length of course: 1 term. Spring (8 weeks)

Cambridge was part of Anglo-Saxon Mercia, bordering on the kingdom of East Anglia. Mercia was one of three   
powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and came into particular prominence during the Mercian supremacy under King Offa, when Magdalene Bridge was built and ended in 910 within a single kingdom of England. The course will look at the geographical extent of Mercia to the Welsh border; its peoples, its dialect.  Northumbria has Bede and Wessex the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Mercia has less documentary evidence but its story is now starting to be told with the stunning find of the Staffordshire Hoard.  Mercia had its own distinctive art of high quality, the Tiberius school of manuscripts, including the Book of Cerne and the Barberini Gospels and an influential style of metalwork, including the elegant Trewhiddle style of silver jewellery, that spread across England. It has famous churches and sculpture, which drew on Carolingian art.  

# Format: Lecture  

About me: I am an enthusiastic amateur whose History degree specialised in the Anglo-Saxons. I have the good fortune to live somewhere offering high quality workshops, which update my knowledge.

Venue: Zoom   
Length of course: 1 term. Spring (10 weeks)

Start date: 20 Jan   
This course explores the story of Western European art from 1300-1600, from late Italian mediaeval artists such as Giotto and Simone Martini to the High Renaissance of Raphael and Michelangelo, and the different context in which Northern artists such as Van Eyck, Dürer and   
Holbein worked. We will consider how writers, patrons, and institutions shaped their work and continue to influence what we consider 'beautiful' or 'great art' today. The course introduces visual analysis techniques for looking at   
paintings, sculpture and architecture and talking to others about it. Each session includes small group exercises and everyone makes a short end-of-term presentation. Please make sure you will be able to attend the first session.   
Visit(s) to the Fitzwilliam will be arranged, if possible.   
[Previously offered as part of my two-term 'Looking at art' course.]

# ARTH 03: Reading women: Questioning image and meaning(s)  

Tutor: Britta Dwyer   
Day and time: Tuesday 11:20 - 12:35   
Venue: U3AC (Pink room)   
Length of course: 1 term. Autumn (6 weeks)   
Places: 25   
Start date: 12 Oct   
Why are women readers so overrepresented in the visual arts given the limited access they had historically to the 'activity of reading'? Why were reading women considered dangerous? In this class I want to bring together a selection of works of women reading - from the Renaissance to present - to ask some loaded questions. Beginning with WHO is reading and WHAT is being read (bible, novel or newspaper) I want to explore HOW the images reflect upon social issues (women's literacy, patriarchal taboos) and crucially, HOW the images function as metaphors for   
voyeurism and gendered viewing. So, join me on this   
challenging journey as we interpret images of 'Reading women'. Male members especially welcome: we need your input and feedback.  

Format: Lecture  

About me: I am a retired university lecturer and have taught classes at the U3AC for the last ten plus years.

Venue: U3AC (Pink room)   
Length of course: 1 term. Summer (6 weeks)   
Places: 25   
Start date: 27 Apr   
This introductory course concerns what we know about Vermeer of Delft, set in context by referring to   
contemporaries.  There are thirty-four works currently   
attributed to this Dutch master, some tentatively.  There are three areas of subject matter - a few   
historical/mythological/biblical paintings, a street scene, a town view, and some "modern" paintings of people in   
interiors of the period.  Vermeer's themes, methods, use of colour and use of optical aids will be addressed, both   
generally and in relation to particular works.  Links to   
internet resources will be offered to enable participants to pursue their interest in the subject material.  

Format: Lecture  

About me: The course is based on a six month research project into the life and works of Vermeer of Delft.  

# ARTH 05: Vikings in Cambridge and East Anglia  

# Arts and Crafts  

# ARTC 01: Arts forum  

Leader: Colin Whitworth

Venue: U3AC (Yellow room)   
Length of course: 2 terms. Autumn (10 weeks), Spring (10 weeks)   
Places: 10   
Start date: 13 Oct   
Each session will begin with a half-hour presentation and discussion of a topic, led by a member of the group. Topics will cover all of the arts - visual, literature, music, dance, architecture, film/tv, etc.  The second half will be an open and informal discussion of the latest arts news and issues - books recommended, exhibitions visited, the local music scene, etc. We hope for a lively exchange of opinions. This is a fully-participatory forum - it is essential that all   
members of the group are willing to present at least one prepared topic during the 2 terms. Presentations can be projected from a laptop, or by handing around reference material, by holding a quiz, or any other method.

East Anglia reaching as far as Ely and Cambridge was one of the wealthiest areas of Anglo-Saxon England, and one of the places most affected by sea-borne Vikings due to its long coastline. The course will look at the first Viking Age in East Anglia and patterns of settlement, trade and the   
setting up of towns helped by the many recent metal  
detected finds. The course will also look at Viking beliefs and conversion, Viking art, style and fashion and how this combined with Anglo-Saxon art, sculpture and metalwork. The second Viking Age under King Cnut brought about a peace dividend, the founding or re-founding of several famous abbeys in our part of the world, who engaged in digging waterways long before the Dutch in c.17th and took part in a monastic and artistic revival - the last hurrah of the Anglo-Saxons.

Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet available today. It is a powerful piece of software widely used for dataanalysis, finance and scientific computing. Many people use it, yet few really exploit its power. The course is aimed at helping those people who only currently use Excel as a way of storing information and for simple calculations. The overall objectives will be to help users improve their   
mastery of Excel. A reasonable knowledge of the   
spreadsheet is needed including the ability to open the program and to enter data. Topics covered will include, Charts, Pivot Tables, use of Lists, use of Names, Data Validation, Functions etc. The course could culminate in a project exploiting the things learnt. You will need your own laptop (MAC or PC). A tablet will not do. You must have a 2010 or later version of Excel.

Most people use computers but have little idea of the way they work. This course will look at the basic elements of a computer, starting with how they function, their use of binary numbers, and consider how a simplified computer actually works and how a computer is programmed. We will look at the general principles behind computer   
programming and consider some simple practical   
examples. I will use Microsoft Excel to demonstrate some of these ideas. Consequently you will need a laptop with a post 2010 version of Excel. A tablet will not do.

We will start with a brief history of mapping, and then look at some of the new ways we can nowadays use information traditionally shown on maps - SatNav systems, Web   
Mapping, Google Earth, Geographic Information Systems, etc.  We will then look at the new technologies that make these new developments possible and consider a range of applications of geographical information systems including e-government, planning, the environment, transportation and location-based services and some of the ethical and societal issues involved. Hopefully there will be time to do a little crystal ball gazing. No previous knowledge will be assumed, but some level of familiarity with the Internet would be useful. The course will introduce a wide range of websites with geographical content. There will be a class website and in the final session members can present their own topics. This is an update of the course given last year.

Do you do Sudoku? Personally I find it even more   
challenging writing computer programs to solve Sudoku and other puzzles. If there are others out there with similar interests, would you like to establish this forum? You may be an experienced programmer, or you might want to learn and be looking for problems to work on. The range of puzzles we might look at is exemplified by the daily puzzles in the "i" newspaper. Some can be solved directly by an algorithm, some require trial-and-error. The Python   
programming language suggests itself, but I'm open to alternatives.

A fresh approach to economics which considers the   
principles relating to the major areas of economic study. It takes as its basic assumption that, in practice, economics should have a just and equitable outcome for all those participating in, or affected by, the economy. Economics is approached as a social study, involving all of humanity, but with humanity seen in the context of its place in nature and the universe. The role of nature as the source of wealth and sustainer of life is emphasised.  Importing considerations of justice, equality and nature's laws into the study of   
economics opens up a much brighter prospect for planetary health and prosperity. No previous knowledge of   
economics is required.

Study of the great economists and their ideas is used to focus attention on some of the hidden assumptions of economic life - the idea of property, the place of land,   
labour and capital as factors of production, the importance of natural resources and the income derived from them, the role of government in managing modern economies.   
Understanding these enables students to see the causes of many of the injustices and difficulties experienced in   
modern economics and how these might be avoided or resolved. The course gives brief descriptions of different economic systems - classical, neo-classical, Marxist,   
Keynesian, monetarist etc - and assesses the extent to which they demonstrate the working of natural laws and the effects they have had. It builds on the principles covered in Economics with justice course but it is not necessary to have attended that course to find this course of interest.

already enjoy reading The Economist, or who are looking for great insights about the way politics, economics,   
finance, demographics, culture, science and technology might shape life in Britain, and the rest of the world.  The Economist is a wide ranging magazine, with a very   
readable house style. If you don't know it, it is a discovery worth making. As a group, we focus, in a highly   
participative way, on the Leaders each week.  You will be debating The Economist's interpretations and its solutions.

We shall use the excellent Carbon Conversations materials by Cambridge authors Rosemary Randall and Andy Brown to analyse one's personal impact (carbon footprint), as well as the wider social and political issues. Difficult issues are tackled using several methods including games, case studies and discussion. Class members consider what changes they could realistically make eg eating less meat or travelling less, and what factors make change difficult. Elizabeth has run this many times for Cambridge Carbon Footprint/U3AC and is joined for the second time by Andy Clarke. Materials may be downloaded, or text books cost £10 to be paid by bank transfer (or by cheque). Homework will be set each week looking at the 4 main drivers of

By 1930, talking motion pictures had become almost   
necessary for commercial success. The cinema had had more than 30 years to develop and perfect the method of conveying a drama without dialogue. The art of the silent cinema then disappeared, for the sound cinema has very different requirements. It was an art form that is very   
beautiful. The purpose of this course is to show examples of films in which that art form was developing and had reached a very sophisticated level. We will see whole films and if they are less than two hours we will have shorts. If more than two hours (and many of the best are) we will hold a longer class to see the complete film. Each film is accompanied by programme notes which are intended to give information. This year we may watch a couple of very early talkies.  

Format: Show films with programme notes sent beforehand, some discussion when there is time About me: I am a retired lawyer and judge. I am a lifelong film fan. I ran a seaside summer cinema for some years in my teens.

Have you ever thought you would love to dance but just did not know where to start? Would you like to learn how to articulate this natural yearning in a series of clear, and easy to follow movements, accessible to persons of all ages, shapes and physical conditions? If the answer is yes, then Dance harmony is for you. What is Dance harmony? It’s a movement system arising from an instinctive response to musical stimuli, based on the observation of natural   
movements of the spine in everyday life. I have developed this coherent system over a number of years drawing from my background in Dance, Pilates and Qigong. The good news is that Dance harmony enables the dancer to   
interpret virtually any kind of music, from the slow and lyrical to the most rhythmic.

Venue: Friends Meeting House, Jesus Lane (Ann Docwra

Length of course: 2 terms. Autumn (9 weeks), Spring (9   
weeks)  

Places: 12  

Start date: 12 Oct  

This course, based on the work of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais, will help you learn to move with minimum effort and maximum efficiency - not by using muscular strength but by becoming more aware of how you move. You will be verbally guided through movement sequences in basic positions: sitting or lying on the floor, standing, or sitting in a chair. The emphasis will be on recognising habitual movement patterns and developing new alternatives. These sometimes subtle movements are relaxing and help to increase flexibility and co-ordination. Please note: there will be no meetings during school half-terms: 26 Oct & 15 Feb.  

Format: Taught course or activity  

About me: I finished my training as a Feldenkrais practitioner in 1998 in New York City. I have practiced in Cambridge for more than 20 years.

Venue: Zoom   
Length of course: 3 terms. Autumn (10 weeks), Spring (10   
weeks), Summer (5 weeks)  

Places: 20  

Start date: 12 Oct  

Health Qigong is a psychological practising skill that combines body, breath and mind into one exercise regime through slow, flowing and effective three-dimensional movements. The first aim is to adjust posture and movement, the second is to adjust and regulate breathing and the third is to adjust mental concentration. There is strong evidence that the Health Qigong, which was developed and widely practised in China, greatly improves general health of those who regularly practise it. In modern times it has become very popular for fitness purposes. Qigong is particularly beneficial, improving posture, balance, breathing effectiveness and general coordination, as well as mental focus and relaxation, helping older people make the most of their mature years. The course does not require any previous knowledge and all exercises are done standing. No equipment needed, just wearing clothing and thin exercise shoes or socks.  

Format: Taught course or activity  

About me: As a qualified Health Qigong and Pilates instructor my mission is to find common ground between holistic Eastern and secular Western movement traditions.

breathing, relaxation and managing long term conditions. We will work at a gentle pace, with the emphasis on slow individual development to enable each student to come to their own understanding of these arts. Many people will repeat the course several times.

countryside to be enjoyed – some walks are pretty flat, but over the years we have found a fair number of slopes here and there to provide a bit more of a challenge. And of   
course, on occasions, there can be a ploughed field to cross! We aim to walk for 10-11 miles at an average speed of approx. 3.4-3.5mph. Shorter walks are for existing group members only. Appropriate clothing and footwear are

The Rock Climbing group has run successfully since 2010. We climb at one of two Big Rock indoor climbing centres in Milton Keynes. These are brilliant for both beginners and experienced.  Occasionally, we also climb outdoors. We meet in or close to Cambridge and car share for the 45 minute drive to Milton Keynes. We share the cost of fuel and there is an entry charge at Big Rock. We are a friendly open group, working together and helping each other. We welcome newcomers with a basic level of fitness and run coaching sessions. Some of us started to climb recently and others climbed when younger and have come back to it. We find that most people can learn to climb safely.  But, we reserve the right to exclude people if after tuition, we are not confident that they can climb safely.  

Format: We offer tuition and coaching if required, but mostly we climb independently taking responsibility for our own safety

We visit each other's gardens, share our experiences, discuss current jobs and any other perennial problems.  Over coffee we might exchange plants, catalogues, borrow books and make plans. It does not matter how large/small your garden is, how developed, or how blank a canvas.  You don't have to host a meeting if you don't want to. We shall divide the course into 2 groups of 10, and then send you the relevant information.  The first meeting for both groups will be on Friday 17th September, when we shall plan visits for the rest of the year.

# HIS 06: Bavaria, the "different" German Federal State - open the curtain and have a look! (Spring term)  

Tutor: Rolf Meyer   
Day and time: Tuesday 11:15 - 12:40   
Venue: U3AC (Red room)   
Length of course: 1 term. Spring (10 weeks)   
Places: 16   
Start date: 18 Jan   
Bavaria is the biggest German Federal State by size and has a very long history which is much longer than the   
history of Germany as a country. Bavaria has changed from an ancient duchy to a modern and very prosperous part of the current Germany. The history of Bavaria covers   
glorious times (e. g. the famous "fairy tale" King Ludwig II), the end of its independence (Bismarck's unification of   
Germany), the dark Nazi years and Hitler's affection for Bavaria as well as the development as a federal state since 1946. We will look into Bavaria's history, society & culture, political developments and economy. A glance at Bavaria's regions will complete the journey. Many Bavarians consider their state "different" to all other federal states of Germany. In this course we will try to discover if there is a reason for this. Maybe it's just imagination?

The philosophy behind this outline course of Irish history is: interest - pure and simple. What does it mean to be Irish? This course will examine the history, language, culture and geography that has made them from the Celts in ancient times to Cromwell in the 17th Century. Any general history of Ireland will be useful, but the course will be self  
contained - no text necessary.

Over the centuries people have travelled in Asia for many different reasons. These journeys were difficult, not only mountains, deserts, wars and bandits but also unhelpful or obstructive bureaucracy.  This course will look at several of them, who they were, why they travelled and where they went. They include a Hungarian looking for the homeland of his people; two ladies who both lived to 100 but made very different journeys; two Chinese monks who travelled to India; finding the Tsangpo gorge in Tibet; the Russian exploration of eastern Siberia and, of course, Marco Polo. The times range from the fourth century to the present day.

The winding route through English begins with language itself: its prehistory and theories about its origin. The first step after that is the ancestral languages identified in the eighteenth century, with a focus on our Indo-European group. The journey takes in all the significant languages once spoken in Britain: Celtic variants, forms of Latin, Germanic tribal dialects, Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse and Norman French. Diversions include the development of punctuation, runes, regional dialects and foreign infiltrations into modern English. Evidence from place names, history and literature is examined. At the end of the journey we consider the international significance of English and the evolution of the language in our lifetimes.  Class members will be set oral and written tasks and will be expected to take part in discussion and in reading scripts. General knowledge of English history and literature required. Not suitable for those whose English is limited.  

Format: Lecture with discussion and activities About me: After working in publishing as a freelance editor for many years, I enjoy sharing with others what I have learned about the evolution of the English language.

Visit the place where Macbeth really died. Tour the tower house of Threave, built by Archibald 'The Grim' Douglas. Find out why Edinburgh Castle was cursed to 'sink in sin' after its infamous Black Dinner - inspiration for the 'Red Wedding' scene in Game of Thrones. Scotland's castles can entertain and inform. They tell tales full of human interest, but they also reflect the country's history - and can even cast light on the roots of Scottish nationalism in our own time. This course, illustrated with photos and maps, will explore both of these themes and tease out from the country's history why it was that Scotland developed an architectural castle style unique in Europe - and then stuck with it for three centuries, long after other countries had ceased to fortify their houses.

Mediterranean Turkey squashed as it is between the high Taurus mountains and the sea, is but a narrow strip of coastline most times cut off from the interior and looking out to the big wide world. The east Mediterranean was a very busy place from early times and that's where some of the ideas came from. Come and have a look for yourself: no previous knowledge required.  We shall start from the west with those intriguing Lycians and end up in Antioch now a Turkish town but with quite a variegated past.

2021 is the 200th anniversary of the death of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the most instantly-recognisable and controversial individuals in European history. Praised as an enlightened reformer and promoter of economic progress and reviled as a megalomaniac tyrant and warlord,   
Napoleon's reputation is as much debated today as it was in his lifetime. This course will examine his impact on   
France, Europe and the world. It will include his rise to power and relationship with the French Revolution, his methods of governing France, his attempts to defeat   
Britain, his military and political domination of Europe, resistance to his rule and the reasons for his eventual   
downfall. Sessions will make use of Napoleon's own   
speeches and writings, the views of his contemporaries and of historians and works of art from the period. No previous knowledge is required.

economically and culturally - concentrating on the late   
1940s and 1950s, but looking ahead to ask what might be   
an end date for a coherent account of the period - was it   
1953 (death of Stalin and end of Korean War), 1962   
(Cuban missile crisis), 1968 (unrest everywhere), mid   
1970s (end of Vietnam War, death of Mao) or 1989?

This course has now reached the Nineteenth century in the course of which the papacy is deprived of its secular   
authority and Rome becomes the capital of the kingdom of a united Italy.  Our seven fully illustrated lectures will take in the short but hyperactive Napoleonic intervention, with the beginnings of systematic examination of the archaeology of the city; the early promise of modernisation under Pius IX before his exile; the surrender of the city in 1870 to the forces of King Vittore Emanuele II; the start of the building of Roma Capitale and a second phase of archaeological exploration; and we should get through to the end of the century or a little beyond.  As before, we will take note of social and religious conditions and structures within the city and national and international politics without.  Members new to the course are welcome.

The course is a continuation from what was covered in 2020-2021.  After a review of the ‘reigns’ of Trajan (AD 98- 117) and Hadrian (AD 117-138) as the ‘Empire’ reached its height, we will look at Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius (138-180); the disastrous ‘reign’ of Commodus; the Civil War of 193; the achievements of the Severan Dynasty (AD 193-235) – with its assertive, often ruthless women who, towards its end, ran the empire in the name of ‘emperors’ in their early teens; the 50-year breakdown of the mid-AD 200s when the empire broke into three; its reunification under men like Aurelian; and the ‘new order’ of Diocletian (AD 284-305). Included will be a look at the women of the imperial house and the state’s interactions with the   
emerging Church. Newcomers will be most welcome but should contact the tutor before the course begins.

This course is for those wishing to learn more about the history and importance of Cambridge's thriving technology cluster. Christened a 'Phenomenon' by the Financial Times, our small city punches way above its weight. In the digital economy alone, Cambridge has the fifth highest turnover in the UK - ahead of cities such as Birmingham and   
Southampton. How did it get that way? Based on a range of material, including my two books about the evolution and global impact of the Cambridge Phenomenon, we'll explore how the early technology entrepreneurs got started, the challenges they had to overcome and how the   
Phenomenon 'grow'd like Topsy'. I'm hoping that at least some of the participants in this series of talks will have firsthand experience from their own careers, so am looking forward to sharing and learning at the same time.

After the departure of the Romans from Britain. The course will cover the 'Dark Ages' and the various theories of how the people we call the Anglo-Saxons arrived, gradually dominated England, and formed kingdoms.  As the course progresses the written and archaeological evidence   
becomes more certain giving us a view of how the   
development of the powerful Kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, and eventually the superpower of Wessex took place. The spread of Christianity is essential to the   
understanding of this period. We will meet the Kings that ruled these new great Kingdoms. The era of the Viking raids which developed from bloody seasonal raids into outright invasions, then to settlements and changed the character of England will also be covered. The course concludes with the Battle of Hastings, the death of King Harold, and the coronation of Duke William of Normandy as William I of England.

We are - some of us at least - living longer than ever. This   
has created a huge market for advice givers and   
commentators of every persuasion, from the scientific to   
the wryly humorous. They are part of a long tradition of   
reflections, whether philosophical, literary or religious, that   
aim to fit ageing into life's overall narrative: how do we   
define it, and how is it experienced? As with all phases of   
life, the third age is to a large extent a social construct   
whose shape varies in different epochs and cultures. This   
course explores a variety of attitudes to the subject from   
the psalms to the present day, from Cicero to Tolstoy, and   
from Francis Bacon to Diana Athill. Can we find in the   
ensuing composite picture any points of universal validity?

The title alludes to Darwin’s Descent of Man, and repeats the much-acclaimed series commissioned by David   
Attenborough on BBC2. (It complemented Civilisation.) Jacob Bronowski took 3 years travelling the world tracing the development of human society through its   
understanding of science. He had a rare grasp of science, but also its historical and social context. He disliked the dichotomy of the arts and the sciences, and was uniquely qualified to take on this magnus opus. You may remember the original series, and book, and welcome the opportunity to explore again:- Lower than the Angels, The Harvest of the Seasons, The Grain in the Stone, The Hidden   
Structure, Music of the Spheres, The Starry Messenger, The Majestic Clockwork, World within World, The Ladder of Creation, The Drive for Power, Knowledge or Certainty, Generation upon Generation, The Long Childhood. Each week we’ll look at one 50 min programme/theme, forming the basis for about 35 mins discussion.

About me: I have led courses on many themes. I relished this Series when aired on TV, and it stands the test of time; a retrospective look will help us find fascinating insights.

The aim of the course is to improve our skills in managing investments, made more important by low interest rates. The range of options for safe and profitable investment is enormous, but with knowledge and commitment it is possible to ‘beat the market'. We learn as much from each other as from media and sales promotional material, useful as this is for background intelligence. We’ll look for insights into how successful investors operate, and try to identify the upcoming regions and sectors. We'll start discussing the issues of the day, financial, political and economic and their implications for the market and for investors like us. We’ll evaluate the range of products, shares, funds, investment trusts, ETFs, trackers, bonds, which private investors normally consider. We’ll then share thoughts and experiences on how our portfolios are performing and so, in the spirit of reciprocity, members should be active investors. Please contact the leader before enrolling for this course.

The course is similar to an investment club but will use 'virtual' money rather than 'real' money. Individual shares will be researched at each meeting, and members can also propose shares that seem interesting from an investment point of view. Buy/Sell decisions are made in Teams, and each Team will start with the same initial investment portfolio and the same money for investment.  At the end of the course, we will all learn from the decision-making processes of each Team. Course members will need to access the internet between meetings, and all the websites used by the course will be 'free to use'.

A continuation of last year's course for 'Beginners'.  We'll   
pick up with the study of classical Latin by turning to Book II   
of the 'Cambridge Latin Course' (with any reviewing of   
material in Book I if the class feels it's needed). We will   
encounter some new 'constructions' and, of course, new   
vocabulary. The scene will also change to Roman Britain   
with a new set of characters. 'Newcomers' will be most   
welcome, but it is hoped that priority will be given to   
members of the 2020-2021 'first-year' class. The tutor will   
provide supplemental handouts to the book (for which there   
may be a very small charge). Let's have fun exploring even

using 'the subjunctive' we met in Book III of the Cambridge   
Latin Course, we will move on to Book IV where we will   
meet more usages taking us close to everything needed for   
Latin GCSE and beyond. Again we will encounter a wide   
range of new vocabulary. Every effort will be made to give   
priority in enrolment to those in last year's third-year class,   
although new members will be welcome. Again there will be   
handouts to supplement Book IV (for which there will be a   
small charge). It is hoped that we will also look at a few   
simple passages of Latin from Roman writers as a   
diversion from the 'text-book'. Please retain your handouts

This is a continuation of last year's course, but new members are also welcome. There will sometimes be a little grammar work, but we will spend most of the time reading, translating and discussing articles in the French language magazine 'Rendez-vous', which contains items and interviews on current affairs, as well as feature-length articles on culture, history, and social issues - not forgetting 'humour'. Please note that we will be covering the same material as the Wednesday afternoon 'Rendez-vous' class (FRE 03) - so don't apply for more than one.  You will need to take out a year's subscription to the magazine, which comes out every other month. Please call the tutor for further information about this. Unfortunately I will have to miss the last two weeks of the Autumn term, but I anticipate that the classes can still go ahead.

You will need to be roughly O level standard to get the most out of this course. We will spend about a third of the lesson each on grammar and pronunciation,   
reading/translating and listening in this relaxed and friendly class. From time to time we watch a short film. We will be using Practice in French Grammar (2nd edition, with blue and red cover - other editions will not do) by Michael Gross, published by Nelson Thomas. It is sadly out of print, but copies are available on the internet. Heffers can obtain copies, but would have to charge a handling fee.

The aim of the class is to help you put aside your inhibitions and speak French more freely.  You will be encouraged to talk briefly to the class in French on any subject you   
choose, which may lead to questions and discussion. You will be gently corrected for grammatical and pronunciation errors, so that you can make your meaning clear. There will be some teaching about these aspects of language, time for informal conversation, as well as a chance to dip into our library of condensed novels and short stories.

This relaxed class is suitable for a variety of levels, but you need a reasonable working level of French. It is a fun way to brush up rusty language, get to grips with varying constructions and expand vocabulary. We read a sentence each (with help with pronunciation if necessary) and translate it into English. We will be reading 'Vous revoir' by Marc Levy, a modern, lively, quirky novel. We will be about half way through the book by October, but new members will be welcome, and I will provide a synopsis at the beginning of term.

The class will read German aloud and the tutor will provide periodic handouts for additional vocabulary and grammar practice.

We will read and translate 'Als Hitler das rosa Kaninchen stahl', a paperback by Judith Kerr - make sure to buy the German version. We will read it slowly, analysing one or two sentences each week to explain, and sometimes   
expand on the grammar and I will correct pronunciation where necessary.  I have recordings of some parts of the book. The story is based on Judith Kerr's childhood and is episodic, so lends itself to being read slowly in class with no danger of losing the plot. The course is aimed at people with 2 - 3 years of German, and would also be good for anyone wanting to brush up rusty German.

The Novelle has been an especially important genre in German literature for the past two centuries. In recent years our small group of enthusiasts has studied works by Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka and Stefan Zweig amongst others. This year I intend to go back into the 19th century but also to advance into the post-war period, which is where we find the first story we are going to read: Martin Walser's Ein fliehendes Pferd from 1978. While discussion of the stories will be in English, the texts will of course be read in German. An important, and I hope enjoyable, element of this course is reading part or all of the text aloud in class. So, new members of the group, who will be made very welcome, should note that a degree of reading fluency in German will be necessary.

Start date: 15 Oct   
This is NOT a teaching class. A knowledge and use of basic ACOL (weak NT) are essential.  If you are out of practice, or are relatively inexperienced, then this is the class for you.  We have fun playing rubber bridge in a relaxed and friendly environment where questions can be asked and notes consulted.  Our only golden rule is that no player shall ever chide another.  If you arrive on your own you can be sure of a welcome and a table to join. Please do not park in Millington Road.

About me: I have been a member of the Fledgling bridge group for fifteen years and continue to enjoy the company and stimulus of playing bridge in this gathering.  

# LEI 05: Online bridge league (BBO)  

Organiser: Barrie Hunt Day and time: To be decided between pairs.  

Venue: Member's home (Members are given one pair to play online each week. They make arrangements with their opponents directly.)  

Length of course: 3 terms. Autumn (10 weeks), Spring (10 weeks), Summer (8 weeks)  

Places: 48  

Start date: TBD  

This course, developed with the Fledglings during Covid, uses Bridge Base Online (BBO) software for those who find it difficult to attend a conventional U3AC bridge group. Many players set up a Zoom, Skype or WhatsApp call in parallel to add a social dimension. Matches are arranged so that pairs play different opponents each week - the online equivalent of moving tables. Each match is played in Chicago format and takes around 90 minutes. Suitable for anyone who can play standard ACOL, you can join either as a pair or an individual - in the latter case I will endeavour to find you a partner. Matches may be played at any time by arrangement with your opponents. BBO, Chicago and Zoom are straightforward to learn and I provide supporting sheets as standard. The league is low-key, secondary to enjoyment - pairs are simply identified by letters in the league table.  

Format: Course or activity without teaching About me: I'm an average social player. During Covid I ran a successful online league and the model seemed ideal for those who cannot easily travel for whatever reason.

Croquet is a great way to combine fresh air, fun and a social activity. We will introduce course members gradually to all they need to know in order to spend an enjoyable afternoon playing association croquet. Actual games will start in the first or second week. The course is primarily intended for beginners, or those who have played before but would like a refresher course. The main objective is to introduce course members to the basic techniques and strategies of the game. Each session will include a tea break. There is a possibility of playing on into the summer with the Histon and Impington Croquet Club after the   
course finishes. As a preparation, we suggest the purchase of a very useful beginner's guide called 'How to Play   
Croquet', which is available for £4.00 from the Croquet Association website,   
http://www.croquetassocationshop.org.uk

principles together. Thereafter we'll be practising those principles, and we won't really have the time to go back, so if you are unable to attend week one please do not apply.

A combination of chance and strategy make for the great enjoyment of this ancient Chinese game which is played using small decorated tiles, and dice. Methods of play differ slightly throughout the world, but we follow the rules set out in The Game of Mah Jong, by Patricia A. Thompson and Betty Maloney (publ. Kangaroo Press. ISBN 978-0-8641- 7302-7) and you will need your own copy. (NB we can provide one for £11.)  You play as an individual, ideally in groups of 4, but 3 players also make for a good game, and you will experience occasional frustration (!) and frequent laughter. A friendly, informal and not over-competitive atmosphere prevails.  

Format: Course or activity without teaching  

About me: Having played Mah Jong as a student - many years ago - it was great fun to re-learn the game and make some very good new friends at U3AC.

This is an informal, friendly group for people who enjoy Scrabble, without being too concerned whether they win or lose! We play in tables of four, and inexperienced players are very welcome.

Contingent on prevailing Covid-19 restrictions, Scrabble out of town will be held in DRY weather only, on Mondays at 2pm, at large tables in my garden.

All birds have different songs and this is the best time of year to learn to recognise them, before the leaves are on the trees. This course offers $4\times1$ hour sessions, aiming to introduce around 20 of the locally common birds.  It is basic, though requires some knowledge of the birds   
themselves. (It is definitely not for those who want to   
discuss the subtle differences between blackcap and   
garden warbler songs.)  You will get the most out of it if you are prepared to revise after each session, by listening to the tapes and also outdoors. There will be lots of repetition. Dates: 17 Feb; 3, 17 & 31 March.  

Format: Lecture  

About me: I have a higher degree in Natural Science, a passion for natural history and have led U3AC Naturalists Groups for the last 7 years.

'It's not what you say but the way you say it'. Do sound values, stress, rhythm, intonation, gesture and fine timing have a greater role in the process of spoken   
communication than the words and grammar we use? For native and non-native speakers alike, this course will focus on the articulation and broad phonemic notation of our spoken language and explore those features which impact on communication and intelligibility. Members' contributions will be welcomed and no previous knowledge of linguistics is assumed.  

Format: Taught course with workshop activities About me: Through my background in language training I have become increasingly interested in the true criteria for effective communication.

Book group 1 reads mainly 20/21st century contemporary fiction and sometimes non-fiction as chosen by members. It is anticipated that each member will recommend a book during the year and then lead the discussion but this is certainly not obligatory! New and returning members are equally welcome. The book for the first meeting of the new academic year is agreed at the last meeting of the Summer term. New members will be informed of the book to be read in good time before the first meeting. Please bring   
suggestions for future reading to the first meeting of the Autumn term so we can plan ahead. The group often   
continues to meet during the holiday breaks and often starts the week before the official term start date. Note: The course will be held via video-conference (Zoom) throughout the year.  

Format: Discussion  

About us: Sharon has coordinated Book group 1 for over ten years and Margaret, as co-coordinator, for the last three. They are joint coordinators of the group.

seeking to broaden our reading experience. Our   
discussions are stimulating and fun and different viewpoints are welcomed from all. The books are mainly fiction by 20th and 21st century authors, either written in English or   
translated. The first book we will read is 'A Country Road, A Tree' by Jo Baker. Members are encouraged to suggest books to read. We take turns to introduce the book for each session but this is not compulsory. The group meets on the second Monday of every month, from October to June.

Reading is a great pleasure, which is much enhanced when you can share your thoughts with others. That’s what our reading group is about. We’ve been going for a number of years now (we used to be Book group 5) and the format seems to work well. I choose the first book, but then the choice comes from the group, so that our range is always extending: it can be an old favourite, a bright new author, or whatever takes our fancy - some work, some don’t, but the discussion is always interesting. This year, I don’t have an outstanding book that I desperately want to read, so I’m going to suggest a book I’ve had on my shelf for some time, and not got round to: Peter Carey’s “Amnesia”. According to Andrew Motion writing in The Guardian, it is a “deeply engaging book… No other contemporary novelist is better able to mix farce with ferocity, or to better effect”. It was first published in 2014 and it’s now in paperback. Happy   
reading.  

Format: Taught course or activity About me: I've been an avid reader all my life and enjoy hearing the views and experience of others.

At our first meeting each member will outline 3 possible books (available in paperback) from which the rest of the group will pick one.

# LIT 05(z): Addison on Milton

Length of course: 1 term. Autumn (10 weeks)   
Places: 8   
Start date: 14 Oct   
(Follow-up to last year's Milton course) Addison on   
Paradise Lost. The poem was first published in 1667,   
perhaps the least propitious decade that could possibly   
have been chosen. The Restoration was at its height, the   
Puritans who had secured the trial and execution of   
Charles I were either themselves dead or in disgrace or in   
great danger, the Commonwealth and all its works   
despised and derided. Early in 1711 Joseph Addison   
published 17 essays in The Spectator which claimed for   
Paradise Lost a uniquely high status that (despite the   
efforts of Eliot and Leavis) it never afterward lost. Why?   
And why did Addison's use, in these papers, of a new term,   
the Sublime, have such an effect on English thinking about   
poetry and other arts?  

Format: Lecture  

About me: I have taught for the Cambridge English Faculty for some decades.

We are not Proust academics (and haven\`t read him in French), but we are Proust enthusiasts. We hope to share that enthusiasm with anyone who has always intended to "have a go" at Proust, but has never got round to it. If that description fits, then please join us. We shall be discussing "Swann\`s Way", his first novel in the series and "Time Regained", his last.

Start date: 19 Jan   
Is it about the journey, or the destination?  Does a carriage ride develop the plot or comment on character?  Jane Austen's works abound not only with carriage rides, but descriptions of different types of carriages, from the   
smallest gig to the most comfortable barouche.  I will   
provide two or three carriage rides in advance of each session via a handout.  This will be either an extract, or a direction for where to find the text, or a combination of both. At each session, I will begin with some analysis, followed by a facilitated group discussion.  The extracts will not be limited to Austen's completed, published novels, but will also include her juvenilia and unfinished works (i.e.   
Catharine, Sanditon, etc.)  Your enjoyment of the course will be increased by your knowledge of the works.  

Format: Seminar/Discussion  

About me: My MA dissertation subject was 'Walks and Carriage Rides in Austen's Novels'.  This course builds on my previous course, The role of 'walks' in Austen's novels.  

# LIT 08: Classical Greek tragedy in English translation

Length of course: 2 terms. Autumn (10 weeks), Spring (10 weeks)   
Places: 14   
Start date: 14 Oct   
'Women of Trachis' and 'Philoctetes' are two tragedies by the 5th century B.C. Greek dramatist Sophocles. They are full of emotion and address issues of concern at the time, some of which issues still confront us today. For example, is a person in pain ultimately alone in their suffering? How should we respond if a friend asks for help to achieve their death? Deep, dark questions but we shall aim to keep a light atmosphere in our reading and discussions. The   
required English translation is that of David Raeburn in 'Sophocles: Electra and Other Plays', 2008, Penguin   
Classics, ISBN 978-0-140-44978-5.  

Format: Seminar  

About me: Since 2006 I have been running courses for the U3AC on ancient Greek poetry to bring it to those who cannot access the Greek directly.

Modern poetry can seem impenetrable and inaccessible. This class may help give you confidence to explore a whole new world. Together we will read and discuss the poems and help each other work out ways of reading and   
interpreting them. This is a discussion based class led by a tutor who came to poetry through being inspired by other U3AC literature and poetry courses. Late in life I have been thrilled to discover modern poems and poets and   
endeavour to share this experience. For complete novices and enthusiasts alike. For those who previously took the class we will follow a similar format this year but the content will be different. Some preparatory reading is encouraged. There is no basic textbook although a brief list of helpful titles will be provided.

Edward Morgan Forster was an English novelist, short story   
writer and essayist. During this course we will be   
considering two of his novels: A Room with a View (1908)   
and Howard's End (1910). We will examine the novels   
individually, in relation to each other and refer to his other   
novels.  In addition, we will explore such themes as:   
hypocrisy & class differences, sexism, social change,   
Forster's humanism, symbolism and ageism. We will spend   
4 weeks on each novel.  At each seminar we will study   
specific passages and course members will be encouraged   
to prepare topics for discussion, in advance.  We hope to   
view and discuss Merchant & Ivory's 1985 film of "A Room   
with a View."

We read aloud the works of Rudyard Kipling in turn. After each short story or chapter we pause to discuss and reflect on the passage. Occasionally members of the group make short presentations on relevant subjects. Meetings are usually at Magdalene College (The Buckingham Room) where we gather for coffee and a chat from 10 am onwards and start the reading and discussions from 10:30. After the session some of us occasionally move on to a local   
restaurant for a coffee and snack. In September we will confirm which book we will be reading in the first term. We suggest that new members obtain a copy of 'The Collected Poems of Rudyard Kipling' published by The Wordsworth Library. Then we will read other books and poetry from Kipling's very extensive repertoire chosen by the group. Kipling was an Honorary Fellow of Magdalene College so it is fitting that we meet there.  

Format: Discussion

We will read modern European novels in translation.  The group decides from month to month which books to read. The Modern European novels group has been running for five years and we continue to discover the most amazing literature. Reading work from other parts of Europe   
challenges perceptions and introduces us to previously unknown authors and their countries. In the present times, although we are not able to travel, we can be taken to other places by reading and stories. This is not a taught group, and we don't ask individuals to 'lead'.  We work on the assumption that everyone can contribute equally. Please contact me nearer the start of the Autumn term for the title of the first novel in the next academic year.  

Format: Discussion  

About us: So many European novels to discover with this group.

To explore modern European theatre by looking at plays, playwrights and key theatre practitioners of the last 150 years. We will be looking at playtexts, videos of plays and hopefully a shared theatre trip. We will explore the rise of naturalism in Ibsen, Strindberg and Chekhov: Irish theatre in Synge and Beckett; Brecht and epic theatre; Pirandello and Dario Fo; Lorca; the theatre of the absurd; Peter Brook; Harold Pinter; the rise of 'physical theatre'. This is to be an extended version of the course I have run in previous years and I see it taking two years to complete it. Instead of looking at fragments of plays as before, we will be exploring complete performances of plays where possible.

19th Century novelists such as Emily Bronte and Charles Dickens deal with profound themes of human love,   
suffering and social justice in a dramatic manner, while Jane Austen's novels are often regarded as a somewhat gentler form of literature.  In this course we shall examine two of her novels - Sense and Sensibility and Mansfield Park - and consider whether Austen deals with the same major themes in ways that are different in style but just as effective in impact.  

Format: Seminar  

About me: I have a degree in English Literature and enjoy reading Jane Austen's novels.

This course is for all who enjoy writing poetry irrespective of form or genre.  We meet fortnightly to share the work we have each produced in a friendly and supportive   
atmosphere. Although we do not write to a given theme, the coordinator attempts to stimulate the group with handouts on a wide range of subjects of a vaguely poetic nature. NB this is a peer group and as such is not a teaching   
workshop.  

Format: Students read their own work and other students observe and comment in a respectful and stimulating way About me: Although trained as an engineer I have been writing poetry all my life. I see my role as a facilitator rather than a tutor.

Ezra Pound and Amanda Gorman (presidential   
inauguration poem, 2021). Both of these poets show what power the poet's speaking voice can command in an   
American world, and what consequent dangers it can   
encounter: Pound attempted through thirty years to align his own American voice, its phenomenal range, tone, and cadence, with Latin, Greek, Italian, Chinese resources, and the result was the utter and terrible defeat recorded in Canto CXVI and nearby. Amanda Gorman seems to point toward other ways of meeting with, and giving expression to, wonder. Again, we'll look at passages I will circulate in advance.

These great poets are the foundation of the tradition of all (north) American poetry of whatever cultural origin or sexual orientation, black, brown, white, gay, straight, both, neither, unsure. We'll look closely at particular poems week by week (texts will be mentioned and circulated in advance - they won't be nearly as long as for my Milton class!) pondering as we go Tony Tanner's classic The Reign of Wonder (CUP 1965) which makes a fascinating case about the way the imagination responded to a new world and its challenges.

# LIT 25: Reading James Joyce's Dubliners in context  

Tutor: Mark Sutton   
Day and time: Friday 10:00 - 11:30

Length of course: 2 terms. Autumn (10 weeks), Spring (10   
weeks)   
Places: 16  

Start date: 15 Oct  

Joyce identified the style of his short story collection Dubliners as one of 'scrupulous meanness'. The book's diminished subject matter, along with its employment of the epiphany (a term coined by Joyce), and its deliberate lack of evident authorial intrusion which allows its characters inadvertently to reveal their truths, marked the beginning of a new style in twentieth-century literature. Joyce evidently conceived of the Irish as his primary readers for Dubliners, and these Irish readers were the inhabitants of a particular historical context - the early twentieth-century Dublin of Joyce's youth. Joyce intended Dubliners to be realistic and revelatory. The course will consider Dubliners' innovations of style and substance, studying the individual stories against the background of the context of the Ireland he so uncompromisingly addressed in the struggle for what he termed 'the spiritual liberation of my country'. The required course reading is Dubliners (Penguin Modern Classics, 2000).

We are experienced choir members who enjoy singing a wide variety of sacred and secular choral music from the 16th to the 20th centuries. Our repertoire is largely   
unaccompanied and we welcome new members with good sight-singing ability. Our current core book is OUP 'Oxford Choral Classics: Sacred Choruses', which encompasses works from Monteverdi to Elgar (please bring your own copy). Additional material is provided through inter-library loan music sets (modest fee applies) and free online   
collections, such as CPDL choralwiki. These enable us to extend our range further into small-scale classical SATB works such as British and continental European madrigals, English part-songs from Purcell to the present day, plus motets, anthems and seasonal music from Palestrina to Bruckner. Those without access to a printer may borrow copies.

Our well-established, enthusiastic SATB group has been “furloughed” during Covid-19 restrictions but we eagerly anticipate singing together again.  We sing a wide range of music - sacred and secular, traditional and modern, and usually also tackle a more challenging, substantial choral work each term, alongside a variety of smaller   
arrangements, madrigals, motets, extracts from   
operas/musicals and other lighter pieces.  In recent years we performed works by Saint-Saëns, Gershwin, and   
Bernstein and worked on two rarely heard works:   
'Hiawatha's Wedding Feast' by Coleridge-Taylor, and   
'Phaudrig Crohoore' by Stanford. Scores are provided but we occasionally request a small voluntary contribution to offset costs. Regular attendance is important as we   
normally aim to perform to a very supportive audience each term. The ability to read music is not essential but you should be willing to learn your part so that you can sing in tune! Please note that this will be subject to monthly review and any limits required to ensure safe singing.   
Format: Participation in rehearsal with teaching and  

encouragement, with a view to a performance at the end of each term.  

About Brian: I have a wide range of experience gained from directing choral music and have worked with a variety of choirs for more than 45 years.

Producers of operas often seek new ways of presenting established works. Some adaptations are applauded, others severely criticised. Some opera goers abhor any changes updating or altering the original work. We will watch and listen to a selection of traditional and amended versions, and will discuss whether we like the alterations, and whether we think they add or detract from the original set out by the composer. I shall show a selection of   
contrasting performances; these will include Donizetti's La Favorite, Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin and Mozart's Marriage of Figaro.  Newcomers to opera as well as longterm 'buffs' are welcome.  Musicians and non-musicians alike are welcome.

"First the words, and then the music", declared Monteverdi - an unexpected manifesto for one of the greatest and most innovative composers of all time. This course will discuss and illustrate Monteverdi's three surviving operas, exploring their background both in terms of a developing humanistic culture and an expansion of musical language in the   
direction of new expressive possibilities. Originating in an artistic and intellectual project that sought to revive the pairing of music and drama in ancient Greece, Monteverdi's operas unsurprisingly base their plots on legendary and historical personalities, notably Orpheus, Ulysses, and Nero. The message however is endlessly familiar: humans are at the mercy of forces beyond their control. How   
Monteverdi presents this in music is the question for us to consider. This course is a detailed exploration of the topic and will include some technicalities. It will require   
downloading of the texts of the operas.

philosophy, in the western tradition, from ancient Greece to the modern era. It will be based mainly, around the ideas of the most prominent philosophers, such as Aristotle,   
Descartes, Kant and Wittgenstein, although it will also cover broader subjects such as Existentialism and Logical Positivism. It will start with a basic introduction to   
philosophical concerns and methodology. It is designed to be accessible for those having little prior knowledge of philosophy, whilst those having a background in philosophy may welcome the chance to revise their knowledge. Two YouTube series "A History of Philosophy" by Arthur Holmes and "The Great Philosophers" by Bryan Magee are   
recommended viewing. A good reference book such as "A New History of Western Philosophy" by Anthony Kenny, is also recommended.

This class is about the exploration of religious beliefs and non-beliefs.  The principal aim is to learn about secular humanistic thinking and the major religions of the world, what they all have in common, what divides them and how they may have respectively contributed to the greater good (or otherwise) of the world.  Historical contexts, scientific evidence and topical issues feature in the programme with the aim of developing our learning and our capacity to think clearly and constructively. This is undertaken through   
listening to presentations and from questioning and   
discussing practices and values.  In those ways, the course presents an opportunity for participants to reflect on, clarify and develop their own thoughts and beliefs in a discursive and supportive context.

One of the requests for new courses this year was for 'using philosophy in our everyday lives'. This is that course! Philosophy is not really about armchair reasoning - it is a living skill.  However, in order that we may acquire that skill it is useful to look at how logicians have applied it in the past. Great minds, from Plato to Wittgenstein, have helped to show us the way to relate philosophy to every aspect of our lives. An introduction to simple formal logic, which can be applied to help with correct reasoning and hence clear thinking, will assist us in exposing fallacies in the   
statements and reasoning of others, whether in casual, friendly conversation or the serious attempts of advertisers, politicians and public figures to influence our thought.   
Flawed and false arguments abound and in this course we try to show ways to untangle them.

Q was a mid-first century gospel. It consisted of teachings   
of Jesus with no narrative, even the crucifixion, and hardly   
even any miracles. Q served as a major source for Matthew   
and Luke in the later first century. Like most first century   
documents, Q has not survived. Its contents (and very   
existence) are hypothesised. Its text is reconstructed on the   
basis of what Matthew and Luke have in common which is   
not in Mark (who is their other main source). We will read   
the parallel Matthew/Luke passages. I will analyse the   
differences and facilitate group discussion. You will need a   
King James Bible. (John Kloppenborg's "Q Parallels" is   
optional.)

Non-Moslems tend to be completely unfamiliar with Islam's key text, the Koran. This course aims to address this   
deficiency. The purpose of the class is to gain insight. We shall read the book together in class. Our object is not belief but understanding of what the text says. (Non  
Christians may, after all, know quite a lot about the   
crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus.) You will need a copy of the Penguin translation by N J Dawood (a post-1990 edition).

The Book of Joshua tells the story of how the Israelites, having left Egypt and ended their desert wanderings,   
moved (on the death of Moses) into the "Promised Land". We all know of Joshua fighting the battle of Jericho and how the walls came tumbling down, but the full story of the conquest and re-population may be less familiar. God's role, in supporting one side against the other in an   
aggressive war, as well as what happens to the natives, are controversial. Our concern will be, not questions of   
historical veracity or our religious belief, but to understand the story as reported in the Old Testament. We will read the book together in class. I will explore what the text says, with John Barton's 2001 Oxford Bible Commentary as a guide. You will need a King James Bible.

Plato's "Symposium" is a profound, witty, poetic, dramatic, and at times very funny exploration of the nature of love. At a party, a number of lively individuals describe what love really "is" (as they see it.) Then Socrates tells of what he had learned on this subject, recounting the teaching of a lady called Diotima. Finally, the drunken gate-crasher   
Alcibiades bursts in, and praises Socrates himself as the object of love. You will need the Penguin Classics   
translation by Christopher Gill. We will read the book   
together. I shall provide a running philosophical   
commentary and facilitate discussion. We will also read (and consider) C. S. Lewis' masterpiece "The Four Loves", an exploration of how having four different words for "love" (as Greek has) helps reduce the confusion which Englishspeakers fall into, with just the one word. You will need a copy of this book, too.

An overview of the impact on the fabric of society of non  
human but highly intelligent beings of the kind we are   
collectively working to create.  Will we succeed in creating   
highly intelligent beings in software and non-biological   
hardware, and if we do, when?  And what will the   
implications for humanity be in terms of our social, political,   
and ethical structures, and our views, activities and beliefs   
as individuals?

Photography, like all of the arts, does not exist in a vacuum, yet too often we take photographs at face value, paying attention to what they are of rather than what they are about.  Photography lives, and has always lived, in a world of influences and challenges to which it responds and on which it, in turn, has an impact.  Its story and current   
practice reflect debates around issues such as equality, exploitation, censorship and interpretations of history. Usually those matters are expressed through the   
photographs; sometimes they are expressed through the lives of the photographers. This course will explore these relationships in five sessions covering: ideas that changed photography; photographs that changed the world; women in photography; travellers, exploration and photography; and photographic controversy and the bounds of   
acceptability (will include pictures that some may find   
offensive).  

About me: Brian is an ex-town planner with practical, historical and academic interests in photography.

This photography group intends to bring together people interested in photography and give a space where participants every week will show their photos on a specific theme, discuss them, exchange views, propose improvements, share knowledge. This will not be a taught course in photography. Some familiarity with the basics of photography will be useful. Participants are expected to have a DSLR or equivalent camera. However some camera phones have become very good and give good results, participants with camera phones are welcome. We will have sessions in landscape, night, street, travel, portrait and macro photography. Each week, when we discuss the photos of the participants, we will refer to the best camera settings for the type of photography. The course will be in 8 zoom meetings and 2 field sessions, one in Cambridge centre and river and a second one in the Botanic Gardens.  

Format: Course or activity without teaching  

About me: I am an amateur photographer. I have followed a number of short courses in different genres of photography. I am mainly interested in landscape and macro photography.

Start date: 20 Jan   
Since its founding in 1949, the Federal Republic of   
Germany has had only eight chancellors as head of   
government. In comparison, in the UK 16 Prime Ministers have held "Number 10" over the same period. Is this a pattern or coincidence? In 1949 Konrad Adenauer became the first chancellor after WWII. Seven other chancellors succeeded him in over 70 years of history of modern   
Germany. Each one faced very different challenges and situations. This course will explain the role of the chancellor within the political system of Germany and will mainly follow newspaper headlines to discover milestones as well as some trivia about their time in office. We will look into some details of their life and their achievements in general   
elections, too. This course cannot and will not deliver the history of Germany but will highlight - by the tutor selected - political and social events.

Love them or loathe them, oil and gas are vital to the world economy, and predicted to stay that way for the next 20-30 years.  Unless you're in the hydrocarbons industry, though, you're unlikely to know much about the remarkable   
technology it uses.  First we'll look at the history and current state of the industry, the different types of hydrocarbon, and how they're generated and trapped in the Earth.  Then we'll move on to exploration and production - how hydrocarbons are located, then accessed by drilling, evaluated and   
produced. If the production isn't high enough, the well can be stimulated or fracked - we'll devote a session to this controversial topic. Finally, we'll examine how the industry tidies up after itself (or not), and its impact on the   
environment. These lectures and discussions will focus on technology, but no previous technical background is   
needed.  

Format: Taught course or activity  

About me: I worked in research in oilfield services for 35 years. The technology used in the hydrocarbon industry is remarkable, and I enjoy helping people learn about it.

This is a lecture course that will outline how the human brain develops from a microscopic cluster of cells, through fetal development, to the moment of birth.  It will seek to explain how the human brain is unique in terms of the enormous variety of cells of which it is composed, and the complexity of the connections between them.  It will   
characterise the major features in evolution and   
development that have led to the emergence of this   
powerful thinking machine.  Finally, we will take a tentative look at how neurodiversity arises, and why each of us is unique.  There is no course work or preparatory reading, but a basic knowledge of Biology (O-level) would be an asset.

Start date: 20 Jan   
This course will examine some of the commonly stated views on climate change and how man's activities affect the planet.  Reports in the mass media come from a variety of sources, including activist organisations.  How accurate are these reports? Are we receiving a balance of views,   
including from others who take a contrary position when analysing the data? Some of the data and conclusions reached will be presented and discussed. Political attempts to limit emissions, generated by the burning of fossil fuels, include policies with far-reaching economic consequences (e.g. in energy sources, energy usage, and power   
generation). What are these policies hoping to achieve, and can they be successful?  Alternative views to the orthodoxy will be presented, based on the work of acclaimed   
scientists in the field, and data from official organisations. Time will be allocated for discussion.  

Format: Seminar  

About me: I have science background and this will be the 6th year of presenting this course.  It is hoped to include other speakers for some of the weeks.

This course offers a gentle introduction to DNA and the cells that make us, subjects which have enormous impacts on our health and daily lives. It is a repeat of last year's course. What is DNA and how were its structure and roles in heredity identified? How was its code cracked and how is it decoded in our body's cells? How does a single fertilized egg become trillions of cells and why aren't they all the same? What are stem cells and why do they matter? What are viruses and how do they hijack our cells? How do   
diseases such as cancer and dementia arise and what can we do about them? The explosion in knowledge of cells and DNA is transforming medicine, forensic science and agriculture. This course aims to provide an intelligible   
introduction.

This course will encompass a walk through the Package Leaflet (PL) found inside every medication pack, bringing it to life with examples drawn from the chemistry,   
pharmacology, clinical science and pharmaceutics of a wide range of medicines. You'll be introduced to how drugs are handled in the body, their actions at cell receptors, and the potential mechanisms for drug interactions. We'll look at experiments designed to answer key questions: does this medicine work, is it safe, and is its quality reliable?  We'll see how data are analysed and interpreted to provide the unequivocal evidence required by government regulators before approving a medication. We'll look at the link   
between the PL and the prescribing information for your GP, and how both are derived from reports and   
publications of scientific and clinical drug development. This should enable you to appreciate the diversity,   
complexity and patient-focused science underpinning this relatively simple document.

What to eat, what to avoid, how to cook it. We will look at safe simple lifestyle prescriptions based on solid scientific evidence referring regularly to a whole host of published research papers. 100 years ago the major causes of death were pneumonia, tuberculosis and diarrhoeal disease, also malnutrition in some parts of the world. Today death in the developed world is largely due to lifestyle diseases. No fads, no moral crusades, just solid scientific evidence based on peer reviewed research publications.

Each week, we will discuss science and technology news reported on the BBC and other websites, as well as news and articles in the New Scientist. The nature of the group is informal, highly participative, sometimes speculative, sometimes critical of the media, but, at all times, as reported by members last year, highly enjoyable and educational. You will be expected to join in and contribute any special knowledge to further the understanding of the group.  Sometimes, we will also share views on local science based talks or on the work of Cambridge scientific companies.  You will probably be a subscriber to the New Scientist, and/or another scientific, engineering, or technical journal, (or follow scientific news via specialist websites).  A science A level, even though fifty years old, could be useful. More important, is that sense of curiosity that led you towards science interests in your past.

We take it for granted that vision is just a passive   
registering of objects in the external world; that the outside world is somehow projected directly into our mind.   
However, modern visual neuroscience indicates quite the opposite. It is now clear that the eye and visual parts of the brain work together as a complex yet highly organised system that actively constructs an image of the external world. Reality is not what it seems! This short course will outline some of the cognitive and neural mechanisms in the process from detection of light by the eye to our ability to perceive and recognise objects, colour and complex   
scenes in the outside world.

This course is designed to familiarise participants with the elements that cause or are involved in weather and climate. Starting with the fundamentals of earth/sun geometry which determines the seasons and the amount of energy received from the sun we'll discuss global circulation patterns,   
atmospheric composition, air masses, pressure systems, wind, clouds, convective and orographic rainfall,   
hurricanes, frontal systems, monsoons and climate   
distribution.  The course assumes no prior knowledge of meteorology and will involve very little maths.  At the end of the course you should be able to understand why it's so difficult to predict the weather in the United Kingdom.   
Discussion is encouraged and welcomed. The lectures will be online (i.e. PowerPoint).  There may be an occasional handout.

The landscapes of the British Isles with their underlying rocks and fossils present an unusually good sample of Earth’s geological history over the last 550 million years. As a result, British geologists pioneered or ‘colonised’ vast stretches of geological time with British names such as Cambrian and Devonian. William Smith’s 1817 geological section from North Wales to London, roughly along the route of the Irish Mails, was the first to represent the   
succession of strata that preserve a good sample of the last 550 million years of geological time. The course takes Smith’s section as a starting point to take an illustrated tour through the history of British life and changing   
environments represented by these rocks and fossils.   
Weeks 4, 7 and 10 of the course will be Sedgwick Museum sessions which will limit the numbers who can attend on those days to 30 with two successive groups of 15, one at 2-3 pm and the other at 3-4 pm. There is also the possibility of running ‘overflow’ Museum visits for those who cannot attend these sessions.

# SCE 18: Modelling the outbreak of infectious diseases  

Tutor: Nick Kerry   
Day and time: Tuesday 13:20 - 14:20   
Venue: U3AC (Pink room)   
Length of course: 1 term. Autumn (8 weeks)   
Places: 30   
Start date: 19 Oct   
The development of an infectious disease can be described by simple mathematical models; the course will   
demonstrate how to construct a spreadsheet   
implementation, but it's not essential for following the   
course. Powerful conclusions can be drawn by exploring the effect of changing the "R number". For example, the UK government's response to the Covid-19 had the goal of managing the number of patients requiring intensive care: 'flattening the curve'. The course will also discuss wider situations such as endemic diseases, examining the impact of vaccination and the concept of 'herd immunity'. Note that the emphasis of the course will be on the modelling of outbreaks rather than on the biology of the infectious   
organism and the search for a vaccine, etc. This course will be essentially the same as last year, but updated to see what can be learnt from later waves.  

# Format: Lecture  

About me: With a lifetime's background in modelling and data analysis I wanted to understand the Covid-19 outbreak and what lessons could be learned for the future.

Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It affects over 3 million, mainly elderly women, in the UK. This course will include bone biology and the pros and cons of various techniques used to diagnose osteoporosis, including dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). It will describe the drug treatments currently available and bone changes that occur during the life-cycle, including during pregnancy and lactation. The course is designed for those who have, or may be at risk of developing osteoporosis, and those   
interested in the science behind this condition. Advice on how to decrease our risk of developing osteoporosis will be discussed. A knowledge of science is not essential.  

Format: Lecture  

About me: I investigated techniques used to quantify bone, worked at Addenbrookes's Bone Density Unit, studied factors effecting bone of young Cambridge and Gambian subjects, and I have osteoporosis.

This course will look at our earth in terms of the   
atmosphere, the waters of the earth (hydrosphere), and the rocks of the earth (lithosphere). We will study the equilibria in these systems prior to the industrial revolution, and the effect we as humans have had on displacing those   
equilibria. No previous scientific knowledge will be   
presumed.  

Format: Lecture  

About me: This is an updated repeat of a course I ran some 10 years ago. The course is based on a book I wrote on Environmental Chemistry published by CUP.

Basic introduction to Engineering and the Sciences using easy to obtain materials like household items, supermarket supplies and recycled packaging materials. A course to teach grandparents to harness the enthusiasm and   
curiosity of primary age children, to create a lasting interest in science and fill your times together with laughter and learning. Play together and discover what fun science can be! I've taught Science to students of all ages in both South Africa and the UK, with a particular focus on primary school science. At primary level, Science isn't treated as a core subject in the same way as Maths and English are, so lessons are often skipped to make room in the curriculum. I feel this is the age to help children develop an interest in Science and the world around them as they're at their most curious. Anything required will be detailed at the start of the course.  

Format: Taught course or activity  

About me: I taught all 3 Science subjects to students of all ages in South Africa and the UK. Prior to teaching, I worked as a qualified laboratory technician.  

# SCE $\bf{\sigma}_{24}(z)$ : The EPR paradox and Bell's theorem: quantum mechanics versus reality (Spring term)  

Tutor: John Cook

Start date: 18 Jan   
One of the gaps identified in the curriculum this year was "Advanced Physics". It's difficult to do most advanced physics without advanced mathematics, but there is an exception. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote a paper (often called EPR) showing that the prevailing   
interpretation of quantum mechanics was inconsistent with reality. In 1964, the Irish physicist John Bell generalised their idea and framed it as a simple experimentally testable equation. The result of the experiment was "Quantum Mechanics - 1: Reality - 0".  EPR's concept of reality was shown to be incorrect. The worrying thing is that this   
incorrect concept might be summed up as "Things have properties".  After a quick review of quantum mechanics, photons, and polarization, we'll dive into EPR, Bell's work, Aspect's experiments, and their implications. The concepts here are very challenging but fortunately the maths is relatively easy, trigonometry and probability.  

Format: Lecture  

About me: I've been working in scientific research for about 50 years; I hope to get a better understanding of the EPR paradox by teaching it.  

# SCE $\mathbf{25(z)}$ : The learning brain

How the brain develops, learns and ages. The trade-offs between strengths and weaknesses that underlie the   
Words brain, (the lawyer who can't ride a bike) or the Visual brain (the Artist who can’t spell) or the Analytical brain that can’t see the wood for the trees as well as the Global Brain, that gets the overall picture but forgets the details. When learning preferences turn to extremes we see the Dyslexic, Dyspraxic, Asperger’s or Attention Deficit Brain. We also look at the emotional requirements for learning, the Aging Brain, the male vs the female Brain, the Stressed Brain (including Post traumatic Stress and Addiction), memory, the bi and multi-lingual Brain as well as Interventions to boost the Brain’s learning ability. This course is a   
reorganisation and update of the course I did last year.

Start date: 14 Oct   
This course aims to answer all the questions you might have about stars. Where do they come from, what are they, how long do they live, what happens to them? To answer these, and many other questions, you will learn how   
astronomers and physicists themselves found the answers; the techniques they used and the theories they developed to explain what they observed. We will range over a wide slice of astronomy and physics; from the first few minutes of creation to the end of all things; from the nucleus of an atom to the entire universe. The course is lavishly   
illustrated, using the many wonderful images available from modern telescopes. It is largely descriptive, but will use the terms and tools actually used by astronomers, particularly in dealing with the astronomical numbers involved! It is an exciting ride so hold onto your hat!  

Format: Lecture  

About me: This is the eighth year that I have presented this course. I post each lecture on Drop Box after it is presented for members to download and keep.  

# SCE $\scriptstyle\mathbf{27(z)}:$ The Pale Blue Dot

Places: 25   
Start date: 11 Oct   
The Pale Blue Dot is a photograph of Earth taken in 1990 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, at a distance of 3.7 billion miles from the Sun. This course is all about the planet on which we live.  It starts with Earth's rather insignificant place in the wider universe, going on to look at how (we think) it was formed, its physical makeup (and how we know what we know), and similarities and differences to other planets and moons.  Then we'll look at geological history, and the current consequences of that such as earthquakes and volcanoes.  Next we'll focus on the thin skin of the planet - the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents - and finally, the biosphere.  

Format: Lecture  

About me: I've recently retired from a long career in oilfield R&D, where the nature of the Earth was a constant and fascinating background.  

# SCE $\mathbf{\delta_{2}8(z)}$ : The physics of the pizza: how scientists use the laws of nature (Spring term)

Start date: 17 Jan  

Most popular discussions of physics focus on frontiers; quantum mechanics, black holes, etc. Before these discoveries, though, were centuries of development of classical physics: for example, Newton's laws of motion and gravity, Maxwell's equations and thermodynamics. I hope to show you how these still form the basis of everyday behaviour - for example to discover what happens to a pizza when the pizzaiola spins it; why, after mixing white and wholemeal flours for the pizza, you can't unmix them; and what holds the pizza (and the pizza pan, and the stars, and stuff in general) together. At the end, we'll see the breakdown of classical physics as the 20th century dawned - the so-called Ultraviolet Catastrophe - and introduce modern physics, with quantum mechanics and relativity. The material might be a bit challenging, but there will be no (use of) equations, and no experience of physics or mathematics is needed.  

Format: Lecture  

About me: I've been studying and using physics for around 50 years, and enjoy trying to make it accessible to everyone.  

# SCE 29: The UK's global leadership in genomic sequencing - a Cambridge success story! (Spring term)

On 1 Feb 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, said 'our global leadership in genomic sequencing has helped us to spot new variants here in the UK, and quickly alert the rest of the world'. Another example of government spin? This series of 5 lectures will describe what genomic sequencing is, how it works, and reveal the Cambridge pub where 'NextGen' sequencing was born. It will address some of its applications to understanding genetic diseases and cancer as well as its role in fighting Covid-19, and on the way I'll explain what a PCR test is.  The course has been extended from 3 weeks in 2021 to cover the material at a somewhat slower pace with additional material on applications such as gene therapy.

When asked which species was our immediate ancestor, the species who gave rise to Homo sapiens? Was it Homo neanderthalensis, H. habilis, H. erectus etc? Few people, outside of the archaeological/ paleoanthropological community, know the answer. Why not, is it that we are not interested, or that we still do not like the idea that we have descended from some more primitive group? This course looks at the history of discovery of our human ancestry from pre-Darwinian times up to the present revolution in understanding brought about by the discovery of ancient DNA and its recovery from the remains of some of our most recent ancestors.

Buddhist meditation is a way of exploring our inner experience and responding creatively to what we find. It can bring many important benefits: less anxiety, greater awareness, better concentration, and a more sensitive understanding of oneself and others. Meditation has recently become influential in the West as an effective method for dealing with the pressures and difficulties of living. It has been practised for 2500 years as a central aspect of the Buddhist tradition, although the course does not assume Buddhist or any other beliefs. The course is practice-based: it focuses on setting up a regular meditation practice and introduces two basic methods, based on awareness of the breath and on the cultivation of kindness. It also includes developing mindfulness in everyday life and walking meditation.  Local buses stop outside the Cambridge Buddhist Centre. There is metered on-street car-parking, and disabled car-parking is available at the Centre.  

Format: Discussion and directed meditation practice About me: I used to teach at Anglia Ruskin University; I have been studying and practising meditation and Buddhism for more than 20 years as a member of the Cambridge Buddhist Centre.

This course provides an opportunity to explore Buddhist meditation in greater detail. It is intended as a continuation for those who wish to take further the insights and practices they developed in the Autumn term course. And also for anyone who undertook the introductory course in previous years, or already has experience of Buddhist meditation. The course focuses on linking our feelings with our   
breathing and on exploring key dimensions of the way we connect with, and respond to, others' experience. We will also examine possible remedies for the obstacles to   
meditation we may encounter. Suggested reading:

# WRT 05: Writers' workshop  

Organiser: Liz Alan   
Day and time: Wednesday 10:30 - 12:30   
Venue: Friends Meeting House, Jesus Lane (Ann Docwra   
room)   
Length of course: 3 terms. Autumn (10 weeks), Spring (10   
weeks), Summer (7 weeks)   
Places: 17  

Start date: 13 Oct   
This writers' workshop is a self-help group that inspires and develops writing through the mutual exchange of ideas. Current members' writing projects include various types of fiction, family memoirs and historical biography.  Each week four members read a short piece of their own writing (1500 to 2000 words) at least 2 or 3 times per term.  The group listens and offers constructive and supportive   
feedback. We aim to learn from each other and consider such topics as getting started, voice, characterisation, plot and story lines, as well as handling dialogue. The intention of the workshop is to enable members to develop   
confidence in their writing.  If they finish a current project, they may wish to continue with another into the following year. Vacancies permitting, we welcome new members during the year.  

Format: Course or activity without teaching About me: As well as being the Organiser, I am an active writing member of the workshop, having joined it 6 years ago.

information and to join, please contact the Coordinator on cyclingu3ac@gmail.com   
All communications are by email.   
Note: Whilst government policy on social distancing   
remains in force, we will limit the number of people on each ride.

Investments are purchased from members' monthly subscriptions of £50 per month (paid by standing order) and there is a nonrefundable joining fee of £50 to cover the significant administration costs.   Members must have some knowledge of investments in general and the stock market in particular.  Prospective members are expected to attend at least 2 meetings before joining.  We will continue with Hybrid Zoom when post-Covid. For further information, please contact the Organiser - Eddie Hatfield.  Contact the U3AC Office to register your interest in joining the club.

working knowledge of computing for accessing it. All   
investment decisions which affect members' unit holding are made by majority vote. The commitment is long term with a monthly investment of £50 payable by standing order plus a £50 joining fee.  Contact the U3AC Office to register your interest in joining the club.
