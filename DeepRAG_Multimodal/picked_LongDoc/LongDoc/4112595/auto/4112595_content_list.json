Limerick Chamber appointed Indecon International Research Economists to undertake an independent assessment of the performance of Limerick City and to outline measures to support the sustainable development of the city. The research includes an overview of how Limerick performed compared to other leading Irish cities which highlights a number of important findings. The research has been informed by a new survey with responses from over 400 individuals including business owners, employees and others. This highlights the key strengths of Limerick city as well as the issues of most concern to the Limerick community. The analysis builds on the experience of models and approaches used in other countries to achieve the sustainable development of cities. In addition, new econometric modelling has been completed to examine the implications for skill enhancement to support sustainable development. This pioneering initiative by Limerick Chamber is designed to provide evidence-based inputs to national and regional policy. It will also enable the Chamber to input to the consultation on the draft Local Development Plan (LDP) and the review of Limerick 2030 (An Economic and Spatial Plan for Limerick), which is being undertaken by Limerick City and County Council. This will assist in ensuring that the opportunity is taken to develop Limerick city as an economic powerhouse for the region. Furthermore, the findings of this report will frame key issues for discussion in the lead up to the election of Limerick’s Directly Elected Mayor, the first position of its kind in Ireland. ",

The sustainable development of Limerick city should also build on key infrastructural strengths including access to Shannon International Airport and Shannon Foynes Port. The presence of multinational and indigenous firms and the cost competitiveness of living in the city are also important strengths. Investment will be required to enable these assets to realise their potential to support the city and the region. There is also a need to ensure the continued viability of local services. ",

Of note is the awareness of the business community of the challenges arising from the dependence on the high carbon sector and the low energy efficiency of residential and commercial property in the city centre. Investment is necessary to meet the requirements for future growth. Deficiencies in public transport and insufficient investment in public infrastructure were highlighted by the stakeholders consulted. In considering the future development of Limerick city the importance of sustaining the growth in the retail services sector and in ensuring high-density development will be key. The survey research suggests that the loss of retail activity and the lack of high-density development are perceived as constraints on the development of Limerick city. Indecon believes that the future model for Limerick City should place a high weight on ensuring that growth benefits all its citizens. Housing shortages and constraints on healthcare are issues for Limerick as they are for other parts of Ireland. The research presented demonstrates that a major challenge exists in addressing the levels of deprivation and social inclusion. Stakeholders consulted were aware of the challenges arising from gaps in social services, low educational attainment of parts of the population, and housing shortages. ",

Our analysis of the performance of Limerick discussed later in this report, highlights the need to change commuting patterns and to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock to meet environmental challenges.

There is also uncertainty around whether the $\\epsilon403\\mathsf{m}$ GVA gap in economic performance has been addressed. While there has been new job creation in high value-added sectors, Indecon notes that the GVA estimates for the Mid West in 2010 represented only $85\\%$ of the levels in the state. This percentage declined in subsequent years and by 2016 GVA in the Mid West was only $72.2\\%$ of the national level, suggesting the economic gap may have widened.

The RSES for the Southern Region was prepared by the Southern Assembly to ensure strategies are aligned with national objectives and deliverable within the public investment resources. It places particular focus on population and employment growth as envisaged in the growth targets set by NPF for the Southern region which will require new housing developments and building capacity for new employment opportunities. Further challenges addressed in RSES are climate change, regional disparity and connectivity. RSES’ vision for the Southern region is to become Europe’s most creative, innovative, greenest and liveable region. It was suggested that realising this vision would require investment in capacity building, climate action and enterprise development. ",

On the other hand, infrastructural requirements for Shannon supported by MASP maximise its strategic position by focusing on enhancing connectivity to Shannon International Airport via public transport, rail and road link.

In relation to its economic plan, the Limerick 2030 plan highlights the importance to diversify the economy when delivering on key objectives outlined in the table below. These include increasing employment (high-value jobs, new start-ups), and gross value added (GVA). To achieve this, Limerick 2030 envisaged a sectoral strategy based on: i) driving value on established sectors (i.e., ICT, Logistics, Advanced manufacturing); ii) capture bigger share of growth sectors (i.e., Life Sciences, Business and Professional Services etc); and iii) secure investment in emerging sectors (low carbon sector); and new enterprise growth (i.e., Cultural, Creative and Digital Media).

The available evidence, however, shows strong growth in overall employment in Limerick City and County but definitive data is not available on the number of actual jobs created or the linkages of these in the Plan. There is uncertainty on whether the €403m gap in economic performance has been addressed. The research indicates that the target for a minimum of 1,000 new houses in the city centre has been met and there were 1,044 new units built in the city since 2016.10 With the targeted population increasing for the city in the National Planning Framework, there will be a need to increase the target for new residential units in the city centre (see Chapter 6 for more detail). The Plan also envisaged an increase in tourism and Indecon notes progress in this sense, as the revenues from tourism increased between 2014 and 2019. However, Limerick continues to lag behind other Irish cities. Footfall in the city centre has declined in recent years and this will undoubtedly have implications for traditional city centre retail which is already in decline as a result of strong growth in online shopping.

These estimates are based on dividing the metropolitan area into a grid of 10 square meters and computing for each the time to walk to the closest facilities. The results of this new evidence are shown in the following figure for schools and parks. The figures show that accessibility to services by pedestrians is particularly high in most of the electoral districts of the metropolitan area, where it is possible to reach these facilities within 10 minutes from virtually every point. Utilising the strength of proximity with Limerick city should be a core element of a future sustainable strategy. Indecon would caution against placing too much emphasis on the precise number of minutes to services in developing a plan for the city. For example, a slightly longer time may be feasible within sustainable models for access to employment and some services if adequate public transport and cycling infrastructure is provided. The figures, however, suggest that the city has the characteristics to facilitate a significant shift in commuting patterns. The analysis also highlights the justification for compact growth and development within the existing built-up area due to the existence of services. ",

The first Climate Action Plan (CAP) was published in 2019 and set an ambition of at least 3.5 GW of offshore wind by 2030. The recent Programme for Government increased this target to 5 GW which will require significant investment.  A recent report by $\\mathsf{G D G}^{20}$ found that SFPC’s “current facilities generally meet the port requirements for various areas of offshore wind construction.” The report concludes that the port will need investment in new dedicated facilities. As such, “overall development is required to ensure SFPC has new dedicated facilities.” This development could easily be facilitated as SFPC has an existing 250 ha landbank with an additional 1,200 ha zoned for port related activity.

        "text": "In developing our recommendations, Indecon believes at the centre of the new strategy should be a commitment to meeting carbon emission reduction targets and the achievement of a circular economy. Of note is the awareness of the business community of the challenges arising from the dependence on the high carbon sector and the low energy efficiency of residential and commercial property in the city centre. There is also a need for investment to meet the requirements for future growth. Deficiencies in public transport and insufficient investment in public infrastructure were highlighted by businesses consulted. In considering the future development of Limerick city the importance of sustaining the growth in the retail services sector and in ensuring high-density development will be important. The new survey research suggests that the loss of retail activity and the lack of high-density development were seen as constraints on the development of Limerick city. Indecon believes that the future model for Limerick city should also place a high weight on ensuring that growth benefits all its citizens. Housing shortages and constraints on healthcare are issues for Limerick as they are for other parts of Ireland. The research presented subsequently has demonstrated that a major challenge exists in addressing the levels of deprivation and social inclusion. Stakeholders consulted were aware of the challenges arising from gaps in social services, low educational attainment of parts of the population, and housing shortages. ",

LECP’s strategy is also intended to influence directly and indirectly the action of an intersection of different bodies, such as IDA, Enterprise Ireland, SOLAS, Local Authority etc. The primary objective of the Economic plan is to “promote a more integrated, inclusive and sustainable approach to economic development in the local authority area”. It focuses on job creation in the local authority area by promoting investment that generates economic growth. It also places an emphasis on diversification to build on economic resilience. On the other hand, the primary objective of the Community plan places a strong emphasis on social inclusion and deprivation reduction, with the vision “to promote quality of life for local communities across Limerick ity and county, promote social equality, embrace diversity and improve social integration and community cohesion.” ",
