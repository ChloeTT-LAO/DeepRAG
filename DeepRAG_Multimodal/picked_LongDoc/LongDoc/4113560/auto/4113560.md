# 5.1.7 TRAC  

Machine installation and setup should always be performed directly by ERGO-FIT or by an authorized service technician. This guarantees for a safe and proper operation.  

1. Inspect the running belt after setup or relocation and adjust it if necessary (see maintenance guidelines in chapter 9.1.7). The belt should always be centered between the two shafts.   
2. For safety reasons, make sure to leave enough space behind the machine ( $2\mathsf{m}$ length and $1\textrm{m}$ width). Cover this area with a gym mat or a similar material.  

# 5.2 Standort und Aufstellung  

Minor unevenness can be compensated by means of the adjustable screw feet. Adjust the leveling screw feet until the machine stands safely. It is mandatory to adjust the levelling foot because it is the machine‘s support. (For a detailed description of the leveling feet please see Chapter 5.5, “Components“).  

$\textcircled{\times}$ Set up the machine so that power switch and plug can easily be disconnected.  

For safety reasons, please leave enough space around the machine for the user to move safely and to avoid that bystanders are hurt by moving parts: Seen from the access orientation, maintain a clearance of at least the training space plus $_{0,6\mathrm{~m~}}$ . Provide enough space for an emergency disassembly. Adjacent machines may use the same clearance  

Please make sure that the distance between the machines is at least one meter.   
Otherwise the POLAR heart rate receiver might not function correctly.  

High-frequency and magnetic interference signals (e.g. radios, TV sets, mobile phones etc.) in close proximity to your cardio equipment may also interfere with the heart rate control.  

In rare cases, strong electromagnetic fields in some locations may interfere with the transmission of the heart rate (e.g. high voltage circuit or tramway contact wires). You may check this with a POLAR pulse watch in case of doubt.  

$\textcircled{\times}$ In case of interference or if you suspect an interference with the heart rate transmission, under no circumstances perform a cardio control workout (CARDIO mode).  

# 5.3 Ambient Temperature  

Your ERGO-FIT exercise machine may be used at an ambient temperature of $+10^{\circ}\mathsf C$ to $+40^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ , a relative humidity of 30 to $75\%$ (non-condensing) and an atmospheric pressure of $700\mathsf{h P a}$ to $1060{\mathsf{h P a}}$ without causing any problem.  

The machine may be stored at a temperature between $\mathtt{-30^{\circ}C}$ and $+50^{\circ}\mathsf C$ .  

# 5.4 Plugging in  

1. Perform a visual inspection of the power cord and the input connector (power entry module) before using the machine. Damaged power cords and connectors need to be replaced immediately.  

![](images/1f22c4769ae02dc7ed9dd549db72d632c0458df0a55dfaebc61e784bc89c92e7.jpg)  
Power entry module with power plug  

2. Plug the power cord into the appropriate power entry module (see picture). Plug the other end of the cable into the power outlet. On the TRAC model additionally move the retaining clip to fix the power cord on the input module .  

![](images/1c74e58c211281006cf1545000442f7e2e1833d428ffe6cda1a9f04f09955aff.jpg)  

3. Switch on the machine by pressing the power button $(1=\mathsf{O N}$ , ${\mathsf{O}}={\mathsf{O}}{\mathsf{F}}{\mathsf{F}}$ ). To switch on the TRAC model use the button at the automatic circuit breaker (see chapter 6.1).   
4. After your exercise machine has been connected to mains and switched on, it automatically carries out an operating check. During this operating check, you will be able to read the software version of the unit on the display. Thereafter the main menu will appear.   
5. Stand on the side of the control panel (view onto the display) and check if the display works. If this is not the case, make sure you followed the steps above correctly. In addition, verify if there is electricity in the mains socket (This is not applicable to models of the 4000 SP and 4000 S SP series!).  

# 5.4.1 Power Supply  

Use your exercise machine only with earthed (grounded) power sockets with 230 VAC $150–60~\mathsf{H z}$ (see chapter A5). If you have any doubts about the power supply at the setup location, ask your energy provider. For TRAC you have in any case to obtain the permission of your energy provider. Only use commercial 10 ampere (16 ampere with TRAC) automatic circuit breakers (type B tripping characteristic). In the rare event that these automatic circuit breakers should switch off when you switch on your machine, the circuit needs to be fused with 10 A (16 A with TRAC) lead fuses or with a different type of tripping fuse (e.g. K-automat). In case of doubt, ask your electrician.  

Before connecting your ERGO-FIT exercise machine to your power supply system, compare the acceptable voltage and frequency on the name plate (next to power entry module) with your local data.  

We recommend DC-isolated cables for the connection of external equipment to a CARDIO LINE 4000 MED machine.  

Always connect your machine directly to the power outlet. Do not use extension cables or multi-outlet power strips unless they are EN 60601-1 certified.  

4000 SP and 4000 S SP machines are equipped with a generator and a rechargeable NiMH-battery for power supply. The rechargeable battery is maintenance-free and charged during use. After starting the machine, it provides energy for the control panel. After workout the electricity accumulated in the battery is used to operate the control panel for about 45 seconds. Then the machine switches off automatically. The buffer time reduces by increasing charging cycles and lifetime. To reach the target buffer time a weekly charge (at least $1\times24$ hours per week) by a special charging power supply unit, which is available with ERGO-FIT, is indispensable. If the buffer time reduces and can no longer be kept up by charging the batteries should be replaced. Due to the self-discharge rate of the batteries during operation at room temperature they should be changed every 2 years.  

# 5.4.2 Cabeling  

If you have connected several ERGO-FIT machines to one circuit never switch on multiple machines. Connect the TRAC to a dedicated circuit.  

$\otimes$ Make sure that nobody can step on or stumble across the power cord.   
$\otimes$ Do not place any objects on the cord as it might get damaged.  

# 5.4.3 Safety Cord  

For the safety of our customers, the TRAC has been equipped with a safety cord. It is attached to the user’s clothes by a clamp. If you should fall, for example, the safety cord detaches from the corresponding magnet and the treadmill stops immediately.  

![](images/1d4b7e9aeff39995f037c6deea0744c28cae6aab38ea25d08104a92a7e413b40.jpg)  

# Attaching the Safety Cord  

Step 1: Take the safety cord out of the transparent plastic bag Step 2: Attach the magnet to the magnet contact switch.  

Please note: The treadmill can only be operated if the magnet is attached to the magnet contact switch.

# 6 Setup  

# 6.1 Switching On  

$\otimes$ Before switching on your exercise machine, make sure the machine is plugged in.  

If you have connected several ERGO-FIT machines to one circuit never switch on multiple machines at the same time. Otherwise technical problems might occur.  

$\otimes$ Now switch on your machine by pressing the switch next to the power entry module (not applicable with TRAC, see next paragraph). The switch must be in position I. If the switch is in position O the machine is switched off.   
$\otimes$ The TRAC model is switched on by activating the circuit breaker. Please make sure that the key switch is set to position 1 and that the emergency stop button is unscrewed. The key switch protects the treadmill against unauthorized operation.   
$\otimes$ The illumination of the display shows you immediately if the machine is switched on.   
$\otimes$ The machines of the 4000 SP and 4000 S SP series are switched on by turning the pedals. As soon as the voltage exceeds a certain threshold value, the machine switches on automatically and the battery provides the energy supply until the workout / test begins.  

# 6.2 Switching Off  

Switch off your machine by pressing the switch next to the power entry module (not applicable with TRAC, see next paragraph). The switch must be in position O.  

Take care that the switch-on and switch-off intervals don‘t fall below a time of 3 sec.  

The TRAC model needs to be turned off by switching off the automatic circuit breaker. If you fall or in case of an emergency use the emergency stop button on the right side of the control panel. The treadmill will stop immediately. For this reason, use the emergency stop button only in case of an emergency. To restart the machine, turn the emergency stop button to unlock it.  

With the TRAC model, make sure to wait for at least 30 seconds between switching on and switching off. Otherwise the treadmill‘s motor control may be malfunctioning.  

$\otimes$ The machines of the 4000 SP und 4000 S SP series switch off automatically when the pedals are not in motion.  

# 6.3 The Right Workout Technique  

The heart rate controlled workout based on the ERGO-FIT point system makes sure that you exercise with optimum intensity. However, you should also take into account biomechanical considerations when exercising. This section provides information on relevant aspects for every cardio exercise machine.  

When using your exercise machine make sure not to step on its casing. Stand on the designated surfaces only.  

# 6.3.1 CIRCLE  

1. You can sit down or fold away the seat to perform standing exercises or wheelchair workout. Grasp the handle below the seat and fold it forwards or backwards. The GMT end stop (see chapter 5.5.1 Parts) is to prevent that the seat pad touches the shroud when folding the seat. This could cause abrasion of the pad. Turn the end stop counterclockwise until it reaches the correct position. See the safety instructions in chapter 2.  

![](images/32a209f38726dea18c7f16ef5f66a133290bd91d284e8ecc0b20b028d9873974.jpg)  

2.  

Adjust the revolving unit (handle and control panel) to your height or workout position (sitting or standing): Stand in front of the machine or sit down. At the lower end of the swiveling axis you will see a lever. Grasp the yellow casing of the lever with one hand and press it down / pull it up. With the other hand you press / pull one of the handles. Just release the adjusting lever to lock the unit in its current position. For better orientation you find a scale at the right side of the revolving unit.  

![](images/a36384a644e012c556e97aca5a39bd82f7e0ab786aae92b3fab0cb02d75d0c3a.jpg)  

3. For perfect radial even run of the crank handle, the length of the crank handle must be well adjusted to the length of your arms. Adjust the crank handle so that even at the farthest position your arm is still slightly bend. For workout in sitting position sit down straight with your knees bent at 90 degrees.  Grasp the handles at the ball  

and bring the crank handles into horizontal position. Release the ball lock by turning the star knob counterclockwise. Adjust the length of the crank handle to your arm length by moving the handle. Then turn the star knob clockwise to lock it. For workout in standing position stand straight and adjust the crank handle so that your arm is still slightly bent at the furthest point of the movement. In order to release the crank handle release the star knob, adjust the crank handle length and tighten the star knob again. For orientation use the  scale at the guide and the red mark to keep your own crank handle length in mind  

![](images/0e72470da4d55a465dcbbde4728b5da4f556ce7ef6f983bbf48a0028cdc463ed.jpg)  

4. Get into training position and move the crank handles as if you were cycling (pushing and pulling). In standing position make sure that you stand with feet shoulder width apart. Stand on the platform.  

5. Maintain the workout position described here during the whole workout.  

6. Change the position of the handles in diagonal or parallel direction. Release the ball lock by turning the star knob counterclockwise. Bring the crank handle back into the desired position and tighten the star knob by turning it clockwise.  

![](images/44e4c3114b7d0772190b046061c68c0db0477ad3837626333dab03c73c078338.jpg)  

# 6.3.2 CROSS  

1. The elliptical trainer is a combination of a stepper and a treadmill. It allows for an elliptical low-impact leg movement. You can select whether to perform arm exercises. Thus the machine becomes a full-body workout machine where the arms are trained with low work effort.  

2. Step on the pedals and grasp the handholds. Keep your upper body upright.   
3. Right from the start and during exercise, always make sure to stand firmly on the pedals. Always press the STOP button to stop your workout session and wait until the pedals have come to a complete stop before you step off.   
4. The recommended running direction is forward. However, advanced users may also want to run backwards to improve co-ordination (different muscle groups can be trained this way). Changes of direction should be carried out only after the machine has come to a complete stop.   
5. The intensity is controlled through the pedaling frequency. You can choose any pedaling frequency. The speed is not controlled by the machine. Step on the machine and start running after choosing your preferred program with your individual and comfortable pedaling frequency. If you want to increase the intensity press PLUS (see chapter 6.4.1). If you want to reduce the intensity press MINUS (see chapter 6.4.1). The intensity is displayed as step symbol with value indication. It is important that you maintain your individual pedaling frequency. Avoid repeated variations of your frequency.   
6. For CARDIO training, consider that CROSS controls the intensity via the brake resistance. At the beginning the brake resistance is set according to the minimum and maximum heart rate. The user starts with a comfortable pedaling frequency. If the heart rate is too low the resistance will be increased. If the heart rate is too high the resistance will be decreased. If the maximum / minimum speed has been reached and the heart rate is not yet out of range the user will be asked to increase/ decrease the speed. This is indicated by the faster/slower arrows.   
7. The PROFILE program is based on workload profiles (workload vs. time).   
8. Maintain the workout position described here during the whole workout.  

# 6.3.3 CYCLE  

1. First you have to determine the correct seat height. The height of the seat is essential for sitting comfortably and performing a radial even run. To find the right seat height, sit on the seat and put one heel on a pedal. In the lowest pedal position, you should be able to extend your leg completely.   
2. To adjust the seat, stand next to the exercise machine and pull the adjustment lever on the seat post upwards. The integrated pneumatic spring will automatically lift the seat. To lower the seat, release the adjustment lever and push the seat downwards into the desired position using your body weight. To lock the seat at the desired position, bring the adjustment lever back to its initial position.  

![](images/ecf113277701c1d58e7ccb8fef98eff1a951a0b0efe1a3106dbfc19c40f0d387.jpg)  

The lever beneath the seat is used to adjust the seat in horizontal direction. Pull up the lever until you can slide the seat. Now bring the seat into the desired position. Then push the lever back to its original position to lock the seat.  

![](images/266a82650996191b4c79039b085a63de6cedcbe3ffd279e667cbc374ae908a37.jpg)  

3. Now adjust the handlebar to your needs. The ergonomic handlebar allows for most efficient workout in both upright or racing position. With the lever beneath the control panel you can adjust the angle of the handle bar. Turn the lever clockwise until you can move the handlebar. Bring the handlebar into the desired position. Then turn the lever back to its original position to lock the handlebar.  

![](images/484ed91c569b0566229a43602027da6a7c4672e76f4d25ae822cb015d27340b1.jpg)

4. During CARDIO and points training make sure the number of rotations is higher than 50 rpm; otherwise the workload may become too high. For this purpose, watch the speed range. The arrow upwards means you should pedal faster whereas the arrow downwards asks you to pedal more slowly. The higher the number of rotations the lower the stress on the joints.   
5. The intensity control is not linked to the rotational speed.   
6. Maintain the workout position described here during the whole workout.  

# 6.3.4 MIX  

1. At the right side of the seat you find a dip switch, the so called seat console. Stand next to the machine and lower the seat by pressing the DOWN-key located on the seat console until you can sit down easily.  

DThe maximum time for the lifting motor to power on is $15\%$ and the maximum continuous operation is two minutes at a maximum of 5 switching cycles per minute. This means that for a maximum continuous operation of one minute you have to consider a cool down period of 7 minutes. If the lifting motor overheats, it might get stuck and the lifting feature will fail. In this case allow the motor to cool down. Its function will usually recover.  

2. Step over the left pedal with your right foot and sit down.  

To make things easier bring the left pedal to the lowest position.  

3. Put your right foot on the right pedal and the left foot on the left pedal.   
4. You are now sitting on the exercise machine. Now lean against the back rest. If you have back problems use your hands to support your body.   
5. Now adjust the neck support to your needs. You can easily push it up and down.   
6. The distance between the reclining area and the pedals can be adjusted. Press the UP and DOWN buttons on the seat console to lift or lower the reclining area (see chapter 6.5). In correct workout position the knees cannot be stretched completely.  

You can also adjust the height of the reclining area to modify the intensity.  

7. The recommended to move forward. However, advanced users may also want to pedal backwards to improve co-ordination (different muscle groups can be trained this way). Changes of direction should be carried out only after the machine has come to a complete stop.   
8. The intensity is controlled through the pedaling frequency. You can choose any pedaling frequency. The speed is not controlled by the machine. Step on the machine and start exercising after choosing your preferred program with your individual and comfortable frequency. If you want to increase the intensity press PLUS (see chapter 6.4.1). If you want to reduce the intensity press MINUS (see chapter 6.4.1). The intensity is displayed as step symbol with value indication. It is  

important that you maintain your individual pedaling frequency. Avoid repeated variations of your frequency. CARDIO workout is not controlled by the rotational speed.  

9. Try not to move your upper body during the workout. 10. Make sure that the rotational speed is higher than $40~1/\mathrm{min}$ . Otherwise, the intensity may become very high. This results in increased stress on the joints. 11. Maintain the workout position described here during the whole workout.  

When starting the machine, it might produce running noise. They will decrease after a short period of time.  

# 6.3.5 RECUMBENT  

1. Prior to exercise bring your seat into a comfortable sitting position. Pull up the adjustment lever on the right side of the seat to adjust the sitting position. Adjust your seat so that the knee joint is extended completely at the furthest position when one heel stands on the pedal (also see CYCLE). To lock the seat in the desired sitting position, release the adjustment lever to bring it back to its initial position.  

![](images/3b377841be238579451e8d916c2fca4e6b0f86b57d54c4820a119cc6467c3b47.jpg)  

2. The focus of the workout lies on the lower body. The upper body is not involved. For this reason, try not to move your upper body during workout.   
3. During CARDIO and points training make sure the number of rotations is higher than $50\ r\mathsf{p m}$ ; otherwise the workload may become too high. For this purpose, watch the speed range (the arrow upwards means you should pedal faster, whereas the arrow downwards asks you to pedal more slowly).   
4. The intensity control is not linked to the rotational speed.   
5. Maintain the workout position described here during the whole workout.  

# 6.3.6 STAIR  

This exercise machine allows for a movement similar to stair climbing without putting stress on the joints. With STAIR the focus lies on the lower body.  

1. Step on the pedals and hold on to the support bars.   
2. When designing these support bars, all body types parts were equally considered. This means the user can exercise in his/her optimal position and find a good balance. Use the support bars to keep your balance. Do not lean on the bars. This affects the movement pattern in a negative way and makes workout less efficient.   
3. Once you have reached a certain fitness level you should be able to exercise without the bars. The arms should swing synchronously to the stepping movement.   
4. Always keep your upper body upright during exercise (do not arch your spine) and never extend your legs completely.   
5. Do not press the pedals down actively but rely on your body weight instead. When the pedal moves downwards you have to reduce the pressure on the other pedal by lifting the foot without loosing the contact to the pedal itself. The pedals move independently of each other.   
6. Rubber buffers are placed underneath the pedals to absorb the impacts on the joints as soon as the pedals reach the lowest position. Please make sure not to perform the motion pattern up to the limit when exercising on the stepper. The pedals should not stop completely on either the upwards or the downwards motion. Only this way can a linear motion sequence be maintained.   
7. The intensity is controlled through the pedaling frequency. The machine controls the speed. Step on the machine and start exercising after choosing your preferred program with your individual and comfortable frequency. If you want to increase the speed press PLUS (see chapter 6.4.1). If you want to reduce the speed press MINUS (see chapter 6.4.1). It is important that you maintain your individual pedaling frequency. Avoid repeated variations of your frequency.  

8. Maintain the workout position described here during the whole workout.  

Additional information for STAIR: A body weight of more than $60~\mathsf{k g}$ may affect the actual walking speed.  

# 6.3.7 TRAC  

1. You can walk or run on the treadmill. Make sure that you maintain a flexing foot action during training and keep your upper body upright.   
2. Before you start with your workout step on the front area of the treadmill and attach the safety cord. Increase the speed of the treadmill slowly to avoid falling and to get used to the intensity. During workout, make sure not to get too close to the end of  

the running belt. The risk of falling increases in this area.  

3. If you have problems keeping your balance and for acclimatization use the support bars. However, you should not use them for other purposes. Swing your arms to keep the balance.   
4. You can modify the intensity by increasing / decreasing the incline (press UP and DOWN, see chapter 6.4.1). TRAC ALPIN provides an incline between $0\%$ and $20\%$ wählen, the incline on TRAC TOUR varies between $-5\%$ and $15\%$ .   
5. The work load is controlled via the speed. You can select any speed between 0.2 and $25\mathsf{k m/h}$ . The speed of the running deck is controlled by the machine. Step on the machine, select a program and start at a comfortable speed. If you want to increase the speed press PLUS (see chapter 6.4.1). If you want to reduce the speed press MINUS (see chapter 6.4.1). It is important that you maintain your individual running speed. Avoid repeated variations of your running speed.  

The maximum time for the lifting motor to power on is $10\%$ and the maximum continuous operation is one minute. This means that for a maximum continuous operation of one minute you have to consider a cool down period of 9 minutes. If the lifting motor overheats, it might get stuck and the lifting feature will fail. In this case allow the motor to cool down. Its function will usually recover.  

Additional precaution for TRAC: Do not turn around and do not stop on the running surface when it is in motion! You might get seriously injured.  

In case of a device failure or an emergency (e.g. if you tumble) get off the machine as described below: Immediately press the emergency stop button. Grab the two side handrails and jump on the left and right foot rails. Then slowly walk to the end of the device and get off.  

A body weight of more than $75~\mathsf{k g}$ might lead to speed reductions and synchronization problems when running at more than 16km/h (This depends on the functional state of the treadmill and the actual body weight of the user).  

# 6.4 The Control Panel  

ERGO-FIT exercise equipment is known for its outstanding ease of use. 4000/4100 S/S SP/ MED/S MED machines for example are equipped with a user guidance system that is simple and easy to understand. The consistent control panel design provides highest comfort and guarantees easy handling. So, if you know one model you can easily operate all other models of the same series.  

On the control panel you find a display and several buttons. Before you take a closer look at the control panel please consider the following aspects:  

1. Do not lean on the control panel or the display. It may get damaged.   
2. Do not exert pressure on the display.   
3. Only press the buttons lightly. When you press a button you will hear a beep.   
4. The chip card reader of the 4000/4100 S, 4000 S SP and 4000/4100 S MED series is a very sensitive component. To avoid failure during long-term usage make sure to carefully insert chip cards into the card reader. When you insert the card you have to be able to read the labeling when standing / sitting on the machine. The arrows on the left of the corporate symbol indicate the direction of insertion. The chip card reader‘s lifetime is about 100 000 insertion cycles.

# 7.1.1.3 CARDIO  

UFor a CARDIO workout (heart rate controlled training) you need a chest belt with POLAR transmitter. This is the only way to monitor the heart rate and to automatically adapt the workload. In CARDIO/SYSTEM you can control the intensity via the heart rate in order to maintain a steady optimum heart rate throughout the workout.  

It is recommended to use a wireless chest belt for the CARDIO and TEST workout programs. Contact heart rate values are for information only. In order to determine the maximum and minimum heart rate values you have to perform an ERGO-FIT cardio test (CYCLE 4000 S, 4000 S SP, or 4000 S MED).  

# You need to set the following parameters before training:  

PULSMAX $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ = maximum heart rate during workout PULSMIN $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ minimum heart rate during workout START LOAD $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ workload at the beginning of the workout for TRAC $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ maximum workout speed (Workout starts with half of the maximum speed)  

# 2 workout modes are available for CARDIO/SYSTEM workouts:  

$\otimes$ CARDIO workout without chip card $\otimes$ CARDIO workout with chip card  

Chip card based workout supports both the user and the trainer. The user always exercises within the optimum heart rate range which prevents the body from becoming overstressed. The trainer on the other hand knows that the member exercises within the optimum range and does not have to be monitored all the time. Another advantage of chip card-based workout is that the user does not have to make any other modifications during workout. The ERGO-FIT chip card allows you to perform the ERGO-FIT cardio points workout.  

# Workout without chip card:

# 7.1.2.4 CARDIO  

For a CARDIO workout (heart rate controlled training) you need a chest belt with POLAR transmitter. This is the only way to monitor the heart rate and to automatically adapt the workload. In CARDIO/SYSTEM mode you can control the intensity via the heart rate in order to maintain a steady optimum heart rate throughout the workout.  

It is recommended to use a wireless chest belt for the CARDIO and TEST workout programs. Contact heart rate values are for information only. Perform an ERGO-FIT Cardio test to determine the minimum and maximum heart rate (with CYCLE 4100 S or 41000 S MED.  

For CARDIO workout you first have to set the following parameters:  

PULSMAX $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ maximum heart rate during workout PULSMIN $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ minimum heart rate during workout START LOAD $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ initial load at the beginning of the workout for TRAC $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ maximum workout speed (Workout starts with half of the maximum speed)  

2 workout modes are available for CARDIO/SYSTEM workouts:  

$\otimes$ CARDIO workout without chip card $\otimes$ CARDIO workout with chip card  

Chip card based workout supports both the user and the trainer. The user always exercises within the optimum heart rate range which prevents the body from becoming overstressed. The trainer on the other hand knows that the member exercises within the optimum range and does not have to be monitored all the time. Another advantage of chip card-based workout is that the user does not have to make any other modifications during workout. The ERGO-FIT chip card allows you to perform the ERGO-FIT cardio points training.

# 7.5 Heart Rate Control  

For optimal results we recommend heart rate controlled workout. With a POLAR transmitter you can always display the current heart rate and adapt the workout accordingly. Contact heart rate measurement is also available. (Attention: Contact heart rate measurement is not possible when the user wears a chest belt with transmitter!). Contact heart rate measurement is for information only. For CARDIO workouts or tests you must use a chest belt system.  

Note! We cannot guarantee for medically correct heart rate values, but the obtained values are a good basis for a safe workout.  

# 7.5.1 POLAR Belt and POLAR Transmitter  

Moisten the electrodes (the two finned rectangular areas on the bottom side) carefully before use. To provide optimal contact with the skin you can use a contact gel as it is used in ECG measurements. Adjust the belt below the chest muscle so that it has close but comfortable contact with the skin. The belt must not loosen during workout. Check the proper orientation of the belt – you must be able to read the POLAR logo when looking at it.  

![](images/d495171654daff8c3eb434ced5c19bab39c49911bb0862d72cf237a18e9ad0dd.jpg)  

Make sure that the two electrodes are not buckled. Heart rate measurement is only possible with correct alignment of the chest belt. Otherwise “E” is displayed (error or no signal). In this case check the correct position of the chest belt.  

Clean the transmitter, especially the electrodes, after the workout using warm water and mild soap. Dry them thoroughly. Never brush the electrodes! Do not use alcohol for cleaning!  

# Operation Range of the POLAR Transmitter  

The operation range of the emitter is approx. $80~\mathsf{c m}$ . If you have more than one ERGO-FIT exercise machine make sure to keep a distance of at least 100 cm between the machines to avoid interference of the transmitters.  

Note: We cannot guarantee for medically correct heart rate values, but the obtained values are a good basis for a safe workout.  

# POLAR Transmitter Battery  

If heart rate measurement is only possible within a very short distance between transmitter and receiver or is not possible at all you should check the batteries (operation time appr. 2500 hours).  

Send the transmitter with the empty batteries to the following address:  

POLAR Electro GmbH Deutschland Am Seegraben 1 D-64572 Büttelborn/Klein-Gerau  

Against charge you receive your transmitter with a new battery. Do not replace the battery yourself!  

# 7.5.2 Contact Heart Rate (Optional)  

Contact heart rate measurement might be difficult if the user has dry or rough hands or if the contact to the electrodes is interrupted, e. g. by moving the hands.  

# 7.5.3 Potential Interferences  

Monitors, electric engines High voltage lines (e.g. trains) Nearby fluorescent lamps Radiators Other electric appliances  

Move the machine to another place to increase the distance to the potential source of interference. In some cases it is even sufficient to change the direction of the machine by a few degrees.  

If the heart rate is displayed irregularly despite faultless technical conditions, check your heart rate manually. In case of doubt, you should see your doctor.

# 8 Workout  

# 8.1 The Effect of the Workout  

If you lead a modern life you are usually not performing sufficient physical activity to stay healthy and in good shape. Cardiovascular diseases are still the most common cause of death.  

This fact should make cardiovascular training a top priority.  

All exercises that increase the heart rate for at least 15 to 20 minutes are called „aerobic“.  

# 8.2 Cardiovascular Workout  

To benefit most from your workout you should be familiar with some training principles. Your fitness depends to a great extent on your body‘s ability to provide oxygen to your muscles. Oxygen is the key to the energy stored in the muscles.  

Let us take a closer look at some of the factors that are crucial to this process: The heart acts like a very complex pump and is responsible for the blood circulation in the body. Regular aerobic training will increase the heart‘s stroke volume, i.e. with every beat it will transport blood through your body. This means that the heart works more efficiently not only during training but also at rest.  

When oxygen enters the lungs it will be mixed with blood in tiny air sacs, the so-called alveoli. Regular aerobic training will improve the efficiency of the alveoli and thus blood is supplied with more oxygen to be transported to the muscles.  

Hemoglobin is the substance of the blood that absorbs the oxygen. Regular aerobic training will increase the hemoglobin in the blood which in turn leads to an improved oxygen supply of the muscles.  

It is a fact that regular exercise reduces the risk of heart diseases.  

In other words, regular workout improves the oxygen supply of the body and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases. For this reason, ERGO-FIT cardio workout equipment is used in training facilities and rehabilitation centers.  

# 8.3 Choosing the Right Intensity  

The workout intensity should be adapted to your heart rate. In order to determine your heart rate you need to do a performance evaluation. Our cardio training machines allow you to control your heart rate constantly even during training.  

If you are a beginner you should exercise in the lower part of your aerobic training zone until your fitness has improved.  

# 8.4 Workout Routine - Aspects to be Considered  

If you exercise for the first time or resume training after a longer period of time you should structure your workout routine according to the following example:  

1. Warm up: Exercise for five minutes at low intensity to prepare your body for the workout.   
2. Stretching: Get off the exercise machine and stretch the targeted muscle groups.   
3. Main sequence: Now you are well prepared for the aerobic sequence which should last at least 15 to 20 minutes. Focus on maintaining your heart rate continuously at the target level.  

# 8.5 Weight Reduction – the Benefits  

Most beginners primarily wish to reduce body weight, the adipose tissue. Regular training stimulates the metabolism and helps to burn more calories both during workout and at rest.  

Most beginners get the most aerobic benefit from an intensity level of $70\%$ of the maximum heart rate. With increasing fitness you have to adapt the workout intensity. However, the assumption „The harder the training the greater the progress in fitness“ is wrong. If a certain limit is exceeded you will lose the benefits of an aerobic workout because the body can no longer provide the muscles with oxygen and instead produces large amounts of lactic acid, and this will make us stop training very quickly.  

Workout just below the anaerobe limit increases the overall workout time significantly. Thus you burn more fat and strengthen our aerobic system optimally.  

# 8.6 Workout Tips  

On CYCLE 4000/4100 S you can perform a test based on up-to-date results in sports science to determine values for an optimum workout that consider gender, age, weight and performance data. The results are displayed after evaluation.  

When exercising on our machines your heart rate should not exceed a certain maximum value. Optimum aerobic workout is only possible below this limit.

# 9 Maintenance  

All exercise machines used for commercial purposes need to undergo regular maintenance and safety inspections (according to MPBetreibV). ERGO-FIT advices an inspection every 12 month.  

Regular, thorough care and appropriate maintenance in particular help to maintain the value of your exercise machine and to extend its lifetime. For this reason, we recommend regular inspections of the machines. Before every use, inspect the casing, seat and guides, handlebar, crank handles, footrests, pedals, pedal straps, running belt and handholds for damage. If the machine is damaged, have it repaired immediately. These regular inspections are essential in case of guarantee claims. In case of a malfunction please contact our service team. Technicians and engineers at ERGO-FIT are pleased to assist you.  

Before switching on the machines, always inspect power cord, power plug, power socket and power input (machine) for defects.  

The following situations make immediate maintenance necessary:  

$\textcircled{\times}$ excessive mechanical stress (sharp impact, defect cabling, inappropriate tension), $\textcircled{\times}$ liquid has entered the device,   
$\textcircled{\times}$ cables, connectors or casing are damaged,   
$\textcircled{\times}$ covers have dropped off.  

Maintenance of the machine may be carried out by the ERGO-FIT customer service. We also offer maintenance contracts.  

# 9.1 Maintenance and Care  

ERGO-FIT machines are low-maintenance products.  

The following chapters outline important inspections and maintenance procedures for different models. You should carry out these tasks regularly.  

Switch off and unplug the machine before you perform maintenance tasks or open its casing.  

# 9.1.1 CIRCLE  

$\textcircled{\times}$ This model requires very little maintenance.   
$\textcircled{\times}$ Do not apply oil or grease to the external parts of the machine.  

# 9.1.2 CROSS  

Do not apply oil or grease to the external parts of the machine.  

# 9.1.3 CYCLE  

This model is almost maintenance-free.   
Die beweglichen Teile des Gerätes benötigen kein weiteres Einölen oder Einfetten.   
Once per week, remove dust from the guide rod of the seat.   
Regularly apply a teflon spray to the guide rod (we recommend “Fin super aerosol” by Interflon).  

# Treadle  

$\textcircled{\times}$ As screws tend to loosen over time, you should check the treadles and pedals after 3 to 5 operational hours for the first time, then every month.   
$\textcircled{\times}$ If a treadle loosens tighten it immediately. Remove the black cap from the crankshaft and retighten the screw underneath with a $14~\mathsf{m m}$ socket spanner. The pedal may be retightened to the crankshaft with a $15\mathrm{mm}$ open-end spanner.  

# 9.1.4 MIX  

This model requires very little maintenance.   
Do not apply oil or grease to the external parts of the machine.   
Once per week, remove dust from the chrome bar of the seat.  

# 9.1.5 RECUMBENT  

This model is almost maintenance-free. Moving parts need no further oiling or greasing. $\textcircled{\times}$ Once per week, remove dust from the guide rod of the seat.  

# Treadle  

$\otimes$ As screws tend to loosen over time, you should check the treadles and pedals after 3 to 5 operational hours for the first time, then every month.   
$\textcircled{\times}$ If a treadle loosens tighten it immediately. Remove the black cap from the crankshaft and retighten the screw underneath with a $14~\mathsf{m m}$ socket spanner. The pedal may be retightened to the crankshaft with a $15\mathrm{mm}$ open-end spanner.  

# 9.1.6 STAIR  

$\otimes$ This model requires very little maintenance.   
$\otimes$ Do not apply oil or grease to the external parts of the machine.  

# 9.1.7 TRAC  

ERGO-FIT recommends servicing the TRAC every two years or after 30.0000 km.  

# Adjusting the Running Belt  

The rear drive shaft is a dangerous area because here the running belt is drawn into the machine. Therefore keep hair and clothes away from the drive shaft.  

Never adjust the running belt alone. For your safety, adjustment of the belt must always be carried out by two persons. In case of emergency the second person has to press the emergency stop button.  

NFine-tuning the running belt may be performed by adjusting the left adjustment screw on the drive shaft while the treadmill is in operation. Use the included $6~\mathsf{m m}$ Allen spanner.  

1. LaThe running belt should run at approx. $12\mathrm{km/h}$ (no incline).   
2. Observe the running belt for at least two minutes.   
3. The running belt’s ideal location is in the middle of the shaft. If this is not the case, proceed as follows:   
4. If the running belt tends to run to the right, turn the right adjustment screw to the right. If the running belt tends to run to the left, turn the right adjustment screw to the left. For minor deviations turn the screw $1/4$ turn. For greater deviations turn the screw $1/2$ turn.   
5. After each adjustment, observe the running belt for two minutes. In order to check its function the treadmill should also run at 5 and $20\mathsf{k m/h}$ .   
6. Adjustment is complete when the running belt stays in the middle of the shaft even after running at $12\mathrm{km/h}$ for a longer period of time.   
7. Hill running and other running styles may cause a dislocation of the running belt. As long as the running belt centers again when running in normal mode at $12\mathrm{km/h}$ adjustment is not necessary. The running belt stays in its position for several months if it is adjusted correctly.   
8. If you want to tighten the running belt, turn the left and right adjustment screws evenly. The running belt should never be over tightened  

# Checking the Running Belt Tension  

Unplug the machine before you open the control panel or remove the cover!  

The belt may loosen after longer use or when adjusted improperly. It will decelerate when jumping on it because the front drive shaft looses contact with the belt.  

![](images/582c981ab806c73dfd4554d1d4178797b4e6d31a4554075398613c495a498475.jpg)  

In this case, check the belt tension as follows:  

1. Open the front cover. Do not touch the internal parts of the machine.   
2. Press the START button to confirm the MANUAL mode and accelerate the belt to 2   
km/h with the PLUS button.   
3. Stand behind the treadmill and carefully try to block the running belt with your foot.   
4. If the running belt blocks, it needs to be tensioned.  

If the running belt is blocked for too long, the motor control will switch off due to overcurrent. This is indicated by a flashing alarm LED on the motor control. In this case, switch off the machine and wait for 5 minutes before you switch it on again.  

# Retensioning the Running Belt  

The tension of the running belt must never exceed $0.5\%$ , as this may damage the belt, shafts and bearings. Make sure to unplug the machine before tensioning the running belt!  

Proceed as follows:  

1. The correct belt tension is 0.3 to- $.0.4\%$ . Apply a length marking of $1000\mathsf{m m}$ on both sides of the untensioned running belt. This marking should extend to 1003 to 1004 mm when the belt is tensioned correctly.   
2. Turn the left and right adjustment screws with a $6~\mathrm{mm}$ Allen spanner clockwise until the correct tension is reached (see section 1.). Make sure that the running belt stays between the two arrows on the back part of the treadmill frame.  

3. You can also tension the belt until the drive shaft stops spinning freely when the belt is blocked (see section „Checking the Running Belt Tension”).  

# Tensioning the Drive Belt  

The poly-v-drive belt is equipped with a belt tensioner and should not require any manual tensioning. However, if the drive belt needs more tension, make sure to unplug the machine plug first.  

You may check the belt‘s tension as instructed in „Checking the Running Belt Tension“ by blocking the running belt. When doing so, make sure the motor is not idling but has full contact with the belt!  

![](images/0a29b195f2b13af51b505454cb3f2246554cd6e6b4c1afcc2ba2c80a0c8ce1fd.jpg)  

The drive belt is equipped with an adjustment device in case it needs to be tensioned.  

# Oiling  

The oil film underneath the running belt needs to be checked at the latest when the oil can symbol appears on the display or if you hear grinding noises. In this case perform oiling and reset the oil interval distance.  

The intervals differ depending on the use:  

$\otimes$ physiotherapy / low utilization, ca. 500 km $\otimes$ training facility / average utilization, ca. 1000 km $\otimes$ training facility / high utilization, ca. 1500 km  

Use the provided special oil and a $10\mathsf{m l}$ -syringe. Only use the provided special oil (special oil is available on demand at ERGO-FIT)! Other oils or lubricants may damage the running belt and bearing surface and the treadmill might get damaged. Two syringes of $10~\mathrm{ml}$ special oil are needed for every maintenance procedure.  

![](images/a92bf01aa5517622b4aaec17878f07986a9f6b318d30add9d79b63a69a38c07f.jpg)  

Proceed as follows:  

Make sure not to come into contact with the running belt! For your safety, adjustment of the belt must always be carried out by two persons. In case of emergency the second person has to press the emergency stop button.  

1. Now switch on the treadmill and select MANUAL mode. Set the belt‘s running speed to approx. $2\mathsf{k m/h}$ .   
2. Fill the provided syringe with the special oil.   
3. Beneath the running belt on the side you will see a board with the injection hole. Insert the syringe into the injection hole and slowly press the oil into the hole.   
4. Refill the syringe and repeat step 3.   
5. Then fill the syringe with air and press the air into the hole to make sure that the oil has completely entered the system.   
6. After oiling, let the treadmill run at $5~{\mathsf{k m/h}}$ for another 5 minutes while no one is running on the belt to allow the oil to spread on the running belt.

# Lichtschranke, Reinigung und Einstellung  

Die Lichtschranke und Schlitzscheibe dienen zur Erfassung der Geschwindigkeit und sollten in Abständen von 6 Monaten mit einem feuchten Tuch und Spiritus vorsichtig gereinigt werden. In eingebautem Zustand der Scheibe kann die Reinigung auch mittels eines Borstenpinsels, der zuvor in Spiritus getränkt wurde, durchgeführt werden. Damit können zwischen Scheibe und Lichtschranke die optischen Elemente vorsichtig gereinigt werden.

When adjusting the photo sensor, make sure to keep the air gap between the disk and the casing of the photo sensor:  

$\otimes$ axial gap: approx. $1\:\mathrm{mm}$ (see fig.) $\otimes$ radial gap: approx. $1\:\mathrm{mm}$ left and right  

![](images/a10020e2eb9117fc724035e2147b45813df1e993d490af3ba51c7a5b3647bb06.jpg)  

Make sure that the virtual extension of the photo sensor continues through the centre of the motor shaft.  

# 9.2 Cleaning  

Sweat, dust and dirt can damage your exercise equipment even after a few weeks. Metal and aluminum surfaces may deteriorate when getting into contact with sweat. Therefore you should clean the equipment every day.  

We recommend “Ecolab P3-steril” or “Scarabig” for cleaning. You can obtain these detergents at the following suppliers:  

Ecolab Deutschland GmbH

# 10 Troubleshooting  

Despite the high quality of ERGO-FIT products malfunctions may occur. In this chapter you find troubleshooting information. If you suspect a technical malfunction do not operate the machine. If you can repair the machine yourself nevertheless inform us of the malfunction. This allows us to record the failure in the model‘s documentation file and to further improve the quality of our products.  

For safety reasons, unplug the machine before work is carried out or the machine is opened!  

# 10.1 Finding the Error  

Malfunctions may have simple reasons but sometimes a faulty component is the problem. This chapter provides you with guidelines to resolve possible problems. If the recommendations listed are not successful, please contact our service department immediately. Our service team will be pleased to help you.  

# Please proceed as follows in case of failure:  

# The machine does not react (no signal when switching on, empty display)  

$\otimes$ Check the fuse box. A fuse may be defective or a circuit breaker may have switched off.   
$\textcircled{\times}$ Did you use an extension cable or a multi-outlet power strip? Always connect your machine directly to the power socket.   
$\otimes$ Has the emergency stop button been activated (TRAC only)?   
$\otimes$ Check the power socket. Plug in another electric device to check the socket.   
$\textcircled{\times}$ Pull the power plug out of the socket and visually inspect the power supply cord.  

# An error message is displayed  

$\textcircled{\times}$ Write down the information displayed in the error message.   
$\otimes$ Check if the error has occurred frequently. If so, when and how often?   
$\otimes$ Check if multiple electric devices were connected at the same time. If so, which?   
$\otimes$ Check if a button was pressed when the error message was displayed.   
$\textcircled{\times}$ Check if the machine can be started by pressing the START button or if this is possible after complete switch off only.   
$\otimes$ If you were not present when the error message was displayed, ask the user what exactly happened   
$\textcircled{\times}$ Try to fix the error yourself (see: error messages) or contact the ERGO-FIT service center.  

# Seat gives way after load  

$\otimes$ Bring the seat into the lowest position and then into the highest position and repeat this once. This causes the oil-gas-mixture in the spring chambers to compensate so the seat locks again.  

# 10.2 Error Messages  

The following section lists the most common error messages, their causes and solutions:  

# 4000 S/4000 S MED error messages  

End of training sequence or wrong date  

# Problem:

# Recommended Separation Distance Between Portable and Mobile HF Communication Equipment and ERGO-FIT Devices  

ERGO-FIT products are intended for use in electromagnetic environments with controlled HF disturbances. To prevent electromagnetic interference make sure to maintain the minimum distance between portable and mobile HF communication equipment and the product according to the output power of the communications equipment as indicated below.  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Nominal output of the transmitter / Watts</td><td colspan="3">Separation distance according to frequency of transmitter (meters)</td></tr><tr><td>150 kHz to 80 MHz d = 3,5/V1*sqrtP</td><td>150 kHz to 80 MHz d = 3,5/E1*sqrtP</td><td>150 kHz to 80 MHz d = 7/E1*sqrtP</td></tr><tr><td>0,01</td><td>0,12</td><td>0,12</td><td>0,23</td></tr><tr><td>0,1</td><td>0,37</td><td>0,37</td><td>0,74</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1,17</td><td>1,17</td><td>2,33</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>3,69</td><td>3,69</td><td>7,38</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>11,67</td><td>11,67</td><td>23,33</td></tr></table></body></html>  

For transmitters rated at a maximum nominal output power not listed above, the recommended separation distance d in meters $(\mathsf{m})$ can be estimated using the equation of the applicable column, where P is the maximum nominal output power of the transmitter in Watts as stated by the transmitter manufacturer.  

# Please note:  

$\otimes$ At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the higher frequency range applies. These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people.  

# A.5 Safety Regulations  

# A.5.1 Safety Instructions  

For user safety the VDE (Verband der Elektrotechnik e.V.) has issued special instructions for medical premises and electro-medical devices.  

According to these instructions, devices with mains connection must be equipped not only with a reliable insulation of live parts but also with an additional protective measure to protect the user against the transfer of the supply voltage to touchable metal parts. For this purpose, VDE subdivides so-called protection classes.  

Of the protection classes allowed for electro-medical devices, in most cases protection class I (protective measures with protective earth conductor) as well as protection class II (protective measures without protective earth conductor but double insulation) are used: In protection class I devices, metal casing parts are connected with the protective earth conductor of the grid through its earthing contact. In case of insulation failure, the upstream circuit breaker will close the circuit.  

The ERGO-FIT devices of the CARDIO LINE 4000/4100, 4000/4100 S, 4000/4100 S MED and 4000/4100 MED series are classified as protection class I devices. The ERGO-FIT devices of the CARDIO LINE 4000 SP and 4000 S SP series are classified as protection class II devices.  

In the user‘s environment, parts of non-medical electric devices, which are touchable after removing covers, connection devices etc. during routine maintenance, must operate with a tension not exceeding 25 Volts of alternating current or 60 Volts of direct current. In addition the supply voltage must be generated by a separate power source as described in IEC 601-1. In this case such a part and the user must not be touched an the same time.  

The use of electro-medical devices is restricted to safety-relevant innocuousness taking account of the state of the art, health and safety regulations and accident prevention. Protective measures must be taken to avoid both direct and indirect contact. Covers, coatings, insulation of energized parts in combination with protective measures using protective earth conductors (in compliance with protection class I), melting fuses, as well as the observation of distances between devices are all part of this.  

For ERGO-FIT machines the most suitable distance to be maintained is 1.5 meters. With this distance, two training devices cannot be connected conductively by a person and it is unlikely that users will receive an electric shock during workout.
