Indeed, flats have grown more expensive, and within a few decades for the majority of Central Europeans they have become a commodity that is hard to afford. It is shocking – but not surprising – to observe how similar the stories told by our authors from different countries are. The re-privatization, gentrification, suburbanization, gated communities and commodification of housing have changed the space in which Central Europeans live. We can point out subtle differences, compare dynamics, but basically the advent of neoliberalism had the same outcome everywhere: it inevitably turned an apartment into a commodity, and a new housing estate into a product. The weaker were relegated to the outskirts, disappearing from the field of visibility. The logic of money took over the space, and both the city centres and suburbs were built using the financial mechanism of mortgage loans. ",

That is why concrete is being poured everywhere (we will soon run out of sand), and blocks of flats are growing, ever thicker and higher – containing not only apartments, but also investment properties.

Having said that, after studying the Eurostat data, we will notice that many countries experience these problems on a similar scale. In terms of overcrowded housing, Latvia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Poland are close behind.

The home was a sphere in which neoliberal doctrine met directly with the personal, everyday experience of individuals, and it could serve as a space for transmission and training of the desired norms and attitudes.

A number of measures aimed at activating the economic potential of housing include, among others: reform of property rights, unlimited possibility of selling and exchanging apartments, raising rents in communal flats to the market level, limiting housing subsidies to the most needy households. In order to increase the supply of housing in the private market, a gradual sell-out of public resources was proposed. It was also suggested that spatial and construction regulations should be “improved” and made dependent on economic conditions. The state was expected to withdraw from supporting the construction industry, and replace it with “making efforts to increase competition”. ",

Let us start with one of the most obvious and at the same time rather telling: the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and many other international financial institutions made debt cancellation or granting new loans for development contingent on the implementation of the solutions they promoted. That is why the authors of the Romanian manifesto are calling today, among other things, that we “condemn and abandon the stabilization programs [...] imposed by large international organizations.” ",

There, too, economic changes were accompanied by violent social conflicts, and the Western authorities reacted by abusing the apparatus of violence, for example by suppressing strikes and breaking up the trade union movement. Yet another mechanism is the economic violence described above, which takes advantage of the unequal distribution of power between the state and international organizations within the global geopolitical system.

Considering the scale of destruction that the region experienced during World War II, and above all, the catastrophic condition of the economies and living conditions in these countries before the war, it would be hard not to appreciate the effects of this policy. The housing system in Central European countries was not without its drawbacks: flats were often built from the cheapest materials, their quality left a lot to be desired, the infrastructure accompanying the housing estates was built much slower than the residential buildings, so tenants sometimes had to wait for years until basic services would be provided in their area. The way the apartments were allocated was also controversial; nevertheless, during almost the entire socialist period in Central Europe, apartments were built on a mass scale. In Poland, between 1971 and 1980, a total of about 2.5 million apartments were built, and in the record year of 1978, as many as 248,000 were put into service.16 In 1960, Hungary embarked on an ambitious “fifteen-year plan”. The plan was to build one million flats by 1975. It was implemented successively, and in the 1970s the number of new apartments was growing at a rate of more than one hundred thousand each year.17 In Romania, from the beginning of the 1970s, about one hundred and forty thousand apartments were built annually.18 Moreover, these countries tried to keep the costs of rent as low as possible.

It penetrated all spheres: from media debates to pop culture images, from daily papers to illustrated magazines.

Even if the beneficiaries of social housing and other forms of social support that the state provided before 1989 were reluctant to enthusiastically embrace the reforms, it was more important for the success of the transformation that they found support among the elites.

The development of housing in socialist countries required large financial outlays, and the policy of low rents made it difficult to obtain adequate funds for the purpose, which is why in the 1970s some of the region’s countries began to cautiously encourage the construction of individual housing. This was not just about introducing the savings thus made by the more affluent households into the economic circulation. It was the sign that the changes taking place in the economic and social philosophy of socialist states were setting in. In Hungary, the symbol of those changes was the reform of 1968 known as the New Economic Mechanism, opening up the country to more pro-market forms of economic organization.21 Similar processes took place in Czechoslovakia and in Poland. Today, it is particularly important to try and capture the moment when the socialist ethos of collective action for a common, better future began to erode, and became gradually replaced by the individualistic discourse of aspiration and material consumption, family values and conservative models of social relations. It shows that laying foundations for the introduction of neoliberal solutions in the region was stretched over time.

It was influenced by local political cultures, as a result of negotiations between different groups of stakeholders, and it took various forms. In Poland, the introduction of neoliberal reforms was particularly aggressive. The reformers were eager to employ the “shock therapy” discourse, and they left no room for illusion: wellbeing of the society in transition was not their primary concern. In Estonia, neo-liberal ideology was integrated as an element of national identity, and the privatization of housing was part of the process of symbolic breaking away from the past of the former Soviet Republic. The authorities tried to symbolically compensate for the inconveniences related to the course of reforms by strengthening the nationalist course.26 It was different still in Hungary, where the society expected the safety net of social security, and the largest political parties responded to this demand by introducing various mechanisms to mitigate the course of transition, including investments in the pension system, family policy, and unemployment benefits.27 ",

For ordinary people it was a fundamental difference – whether the reforms in the 1990s were accompanied by protective measures, mitigating the effects of changes and improving the quality of everyday life, or whether they were offered symbolic ennoblement as the only form of compensation, leading to increased ethnic tensions and antagonizing various social groups.

No wonder that entrepreneurs soon appeared on the housing market, having noticed a source of guaranteed profit in the recipients of the benefits. Private companies began to buy former workers’ hostels and apartments in multi-family blocks of flats and rent them out to people who receive housing allowances. The regulations do not define the conditions to be met by social housing. As a result, numerous Romani families, who cannot find apartments for rent in the commercial market – among other things, due to prejudice on the part of the majority society36 – are forced to live in substandard, overcrowded, run-down workers’ hostels or dilapidated blocks of flats. Shortterm lease contracts and the terrible condition of the buildings (which can be taken out of service at any time) force Roma families to move frequently. Another feature of the neoliberal economic model emerges: there is no group too poor or too vulnerable to become a source of additional profit.

It regulates the rhythm of everyday life, based on a specific routine of necessary habits and behaviours. It can become an eloquent element of self-creation or, on the contrary, an allegorical cage from which we strive to escape – a lesson that many of us learned the hard way during the pandemic. All the while, the material shell of the apartment is covered with a dense web of personal meanings and associations assigned thereto, memories of moments spent with loved ones, emotions we experienced. Despite the multidimensionality of the issue, Poles have become accustomed to considering it in terms imposed by the neoliberal dogma, which reduces housing to economic parameters, dictated not so much by the actual costs of shaping the housing environment, but by the imperative of profit. As a result, the selling price per square meter has become the most sacred indicator describing the home. ",

The emancipation of man from the reality filled with threats became a historic turning point; it opened the way to a new order, which to a greater or lesser extent began to be guided by Margaret Thatcher’s infamous maxim “There’s no such thing as society.” In the ethical and political discourse, utopian visions of a just society began to be displaced by new goals focused on the individual and his never-ending identity project. The modern condition of “continuous transgression” turned out not only to be devoid of faith in gaining control of the future – and thus a goal that would be worth striving for – but also lacking the support of a community of people heading in a similar direction. The fragmentary nature of the world and the indeterminacy of the individual resulted in anxiety, as well as loneliness in facing life challenges. Furthermore, Bauman concludes, individualization is not a choice but a human fate, and the independence or self-sufficiency of the individual is yet another illusion.4 Thus, freedom has a bitter aftertaste of appearances, because we did not choose the circumstances in which we are faced with our choices, and we probably have no influence upon those either.

The individual is the citizen’s worst enemy because the citizen “is a person inclined to seek his or her own welfare through the well-being of the city – while the individual tends to be lukewarm, sceptical or wary about ‘common cause’.”5 Bauman’s concerns are shared by the American philosopher and historian of ideas, Mark Lilla. The latter criticizes contemporary liberal politics for giving up inspiring people to actively transform society in favour of the passive, social construction of individuals: “In an age when we need to educate young people to think of themselves as citizens with duties toward each other, we encourage them instead to descend into the rabbit hole of the self.”6 The individual pulled into an identity project, out of momentum ends up occupying a position in the culture war in which “what is being said is much less important than who wants to speak and for what reason”.7 Michał Markowski, literary critic and essayist, explains that the direct consequence of “aggression of opinions, emotions, and values” is progressing polarization, because the dividing line today runs in a horizontal, level relationship, between contradictory world views of voters, rather than vertically, bottom-up, that is, between society and those in power.8 ",

In Poland, statistically, there are significantly fewer robberies and thefts than in many other countries within the European Community.26 The obsessive construction of wire mesh fences – which by the way are easy to climb over – is on the one hand a marketing trick based on the commodification of fear, and on the other hand, an expression of the nouveau riche prestige associated with the place where such “problems” as “people walking by the windows”, “bums loitering”, or “drunk students returning home at night” have been eliminated.27 We are slowly bidding farewell to fences thanks to the new landscape laws, written in the belief that the city should be a common platform, a place to live and meet various social groups, with a structure allowing for free movement of people.

Although neither adequate quality, nor even the number, can be ensured solely by market forces, it is precisely the accessibility – especially understood as affordability, i.e. cost below 40 per cent of a household’s income32 – that simply cannot be realized in a free market reality on its own accord.

Top-down, systemic organizational measures resulting from the policy of the State or local government include, for example, elements of fiscal policy (tax breaks), supply policy (council housing and social housing), demand policy (housing loan subsidies or preferential loans), and rent control. Bottom-up instruments are related to the potential of self-organization of groups of people; these include small housing associations, construction groups, and cohousing.

Meanwhile, a cooperative initiative has the potential of being much cheaper, and therefore attractive, especially to those who fall within the rent gap. You will still have to take out a loan to cover the investment contribution and its subsequent costs, but it will be a much lower one, because the payment of the developer’s profit and overheads that includes sales offices, agents and marketing will not be added to the cost of building the apartment. The difference becomes significant when you take into account high developer margins, which have remained at the level of 20–30 per cent for several years.35 If local governments were to recognize bottom-up housing initiatives as something positive, they could support cooperatives, for example by selling plots at preferential prices, which would contribute to further cost reduction.36 Building with their own housing environment in mind, the cooperatives would be able to define and meet their expectations ",

Detailed analyses of the needs of future residents, including all the scales of everyday routine – from the ideal dimensions of living rooms, kitchens, bedrooms and bathrooms, down to the standards for wardrobes, lockers and cupboards, and even drawers with cutlery compartments – were found in the God Bostad [Good Apartment] handbook, published in 1954. Erik Stenberg of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, an architect and researcher of the “record years”,43 explains that these design guidelines – in the modernist spirit of seeking the measurability of life and corresponding standards – contributed greatly to subsequent success of IKEA. Swedish prefabricated apartments were spacious, comfortable, and well-lit, and at the same time they were designed in a modernist style, whose logic is still appreciated by their tenants today.44 From the contemporary perspective, the most remarkable feature is the fully prefabricated S-66 system by Ohlsson & Skarne (later purchased by Skanska), consisting of load-bearing walls, ceiling panels and columns. In this arrangement, the load-bearing walls do not cut across the flats, so the arrangement and layout of the latter depends on the needs of the users. The orthogonal discipline of this system imposes limitations on moulding the external architectural body, but it offers high flexibility of shaping the interior – it is possible not only to create independent units, but also to connect apartments relatively freely, which was achieved, for example, in the design by the aforementioned Erik Stenberg for a family of ten. The S-66 has been tested and proven both in six-storey blocks in the Stockholm district of Tensta, and in the intimate Orminge development outside the city, where the height of the buildings does not exceed three storeys.

Compared to Poland or Germany, the losses that we suffered on the housing market because of the war were minor. What is more, as a result of post-war displacement, former German flats and houses became vacant. There were so many of them that not all were utilised during the re-populating of border areas. In the five years from 1946 to 1950, the average annual increase was only 1.39 new dwelling per 1,000 inhabitants. The focus was on repairing the economy. The recovery in housing construction began only with the advent of socialist industrialization. Apart from the state, the role of housing cooperatives has gained importance again. The culmination took place in the 1970s – when the annual average growth exceeded 8 new apartments per 1,000 inhabitants. Unfortunately, the economy could not cope with such dynamics; stagnation set in, and by the end of the 1980s the growth rate had dropped by almost half. After the collapse of the centrally planned and governed economy, the gap has widened: in the first half of the 1990s the annual average was 2.73, and in the second half of the 1990s it was only 1.99.

During the communist era, the car was as scarce as housing, so for many families both these symbols of freedom remained in the sphere of unfulfilled dreams. An escape from blocks of flats should therefore be understood as a pursuit of a dream of an ideal home rather than a way out of an unsuitable way of living into a more satisfactory one. Already in the 1970s and 1980s, sociological research showed that two-thirds of the residents were satisfied with their apartment in the housing estate.11 Even today, a third of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic live in the projects, and these are definitely not only the socially weakest people – as the gloomy forecasts of ghettoisation of housing estates were trying to scare us back in the 1990s. Some of the inhabitants have indeed been kept there by their economic situation, but we must not forget that many of them grew up in the housing estates and they identify with this environment, or at least they have got accustomed to its advantages.

Therefore, both groups do without architecture – indeed, in several apartment complexes the architectural creation seems rather ludicrous. The suburbs are constantly growing in the landscape like mould, and separating the cities from that landscape. More and more new land is earmarked for development around large cities. The mould also attacks older habitats that have wisely limited their growth with the aid of a zoning plan.

In the suburbs, the ratio is more like 1:1. There, life without a car is simply not possible. The car-dependency line is somewhere between a population density of thirty and forty inhabitants per hectare. The provision of public transport can be plausibly considered with a population density of fifty inhabitants per hectare. Ordinary walking distances to shops and basic services within a quarter of an hour start at a density of one hundred inhabitants per hectare. In the suburbs, there is nowhere to walk to, or even to path to walk along. The lack of public transportation infrastructure contributes to the increase in the traffic of individual vehicles, and the economic and environmental costs of this state of affairs are borne by society as a whole ",

By its very nature, a detached single-family house will never be environmentally friendly. Adding to the already mentioned needs for increased transportation, infrastructure, and the impact of travel by individual means of transport on the environment, there is something that I like to call the criterion of social acceptability. Seen from this angle, the age of Czech apartments is a positive feature. Residential buildings have an increasingly shorter “useful life”, especially in the suburbs. The problem is not limited to the service life of the buildings; it is also that society stops accepting them. One generation made their dream of a perfect apartment come true by building šumperák homes on their own, and as soon as the next generation came of age, those homes became the object of contempt. Children of refugees from the projects to the suburbs are returning to the cities, and bringing elements of their lifestyle with them when they move in to the older buildings. The principle of sustainable construction means that we will not tear down tomorrow what we have built today. What is the situation in the Czech Republic in this respect? On the one hand, the beginnings of architects’ ecological thinking can be traced back to the 1940s. Currently, many interesting environmentally conscious buildings are being built, and extensive informational and educational activities are being conducted. On the other hand, statistics show that, for example, the number of energy-efficient A-class buildings is growing at a slow pace. The only regular growth, at 6 per cent each year, is observed in the interest in wooden houses.15 Reflection on the change of tone in Czech society has long been hampered by the ",

The architecture of their homes, identified with the capitalist past, was not being renovated apart from a few examples of revitalization projects (Arnimplatz, Arkonaplatz); therefore, it was gradually decaying.14 Any renovation investments were made impossible by the artificially maintained level of rents, throughout East Germany, at the level they were in 1936. Despite the nationalization of the land, 41 per cent of the flats still remained in private hands. Since the low rent made it impossible not only to earn money on rent, but also to carry out any renovation works, landlords often relinquished their properties to the state. Statistics show that East Germans lived in much worse conditions than West Germans. In 1989, 99 per cent of western flats had a shower or a bath, and 98 per cent had a toilet; in the east, these figures were 80 per cent and 73 per cent, respectively.15. ",

The displaced tenants were offered new apartments in the Markisches Viertel, Gropiusstadt, or Falkenhangener Feld projects, which were built on the then outskirts of the city. The protests of residents in Kreuzberg and Wedding as well as a reorientation in the perception of historicist architecture led in the 1970s to a modification of the planning course, and shifted the focus to the modernization of tenement houses and their surroundings. An important condition for these changes, known as “careful revitalization” (behutsame Stadterneuerung), was the inclusion of townhouses’ tenants in the redevelopment planning process and keeping rents at a level that would allow them to return to their old apartments after those had been renovated.16 ",

Until 1996, those who built new facilities, and until 1998, those who modernized the existing ones were eligible to apply.21 It was mainly the buyers of flats for rent, well-earning Germans from the West, who benefited from the new regulations; they treated investment in real estate market as an opportunity to reduce their income taxes.

Many of them, overwhelmed by the enormity of necessary renovation investments, resold the recovered property to development companies. Most of the longterm rental houses in the eastern districts, which had not been modernized, were in a deplorable condition. Soon after reunification, the city launched a program for revitalizing tenement houses. They attempted to implement it under the slogan of “careful revitalization” like the one used in West Berlin.

After 1989, Berlin sold more than half of its land that was fit for development; no other German city had disposed of so much land at that time. Plots of land were sold to the highest bidder, therefore the investors who wished to capitalise on that, built luxury real estate rather than flats for the average Berliners.

The insufficient number of flats on the market also affected rental prices – they grew at a dizzying pace. The residents of Berlin began to split into those with the old lease agreements, and those with the new ones, as each re-letting of the apartment allows the owner to increase the rent. Currently, those who wish to rent an apartment have to pay much more than those who have been renting for years. People of limited financial means often restore to looking for a place on the outskirts of the city. For incumbent Berliners, “luxury renovations” present a big problem. The owners of tenement houses carry out modernization (for example, they add balconies and install elevators), and the costs – usually high – can later be incorporated in the rent. Legally, the city can prevent this type of investment from happening – among others, thanks to the Milieuschutz (community protection) program, which covers the areas threatened with gentrification.

The main statutory tasks of TBSs include the construction and operation of residential buildings with housing units made available on the basis of social lease, aimed at people who are above the threshold of earnings that would make them eligible for an allocation of council housing, yet at the same time they do not earn enough to take out a mortgage. Optionally, TBSs can administer the stock of council flats and conduct other activities related to construction and to housing infrastructure.4 Some municipalities have decided to use the extended option – for example, TBSs in Stargard and Szczecin successfully manage council flats, while the TBS in Katowice is currently implementing a multistorey car park in the Culture Zone and an aparthotel in the city centre.

The largest of those – TBS Kliny Zacisze – has built 1,013 apartments to date. These investment projects do not stand out from the contemporary architecture of other developer-built housing estates. The developer’s aesthetics is not accidental, as all of Kraków’s TBSs are owned by private construction companies, and they consistently implement a policy of building commercial apartments for sale – the last social apartments for rent in the capital of the Małopolska region were put into use in 2006. On the map of Polish TBSs, Kraków remains an exception; apart from Rzeszów, every other main regional city can boast a TBS of their own, belonging to the municipality. ",

The architecture of another project by the Szczecin TBS, Paska-Parkowa (2001–2003) transports us to the mecca of social housing: contemporary Vienna. The housing estate designed by Szczecin-based studio Domino Grupa Architektoniczna fits in well with the dense downtown development. The façade is distinguished by solids covered with natural wood, the windows are large, and the balconies are plenty. In the scans of analogue photos posted on the SBTS website, only the cars and the clothes worn by the passers-by reveal that this is Poland of 2003 AD.

On the one hand, it improves and even enables the implementation of investment projects in municipalities that are otherwise unable to provide the company with sufficient financing; on the other hand, it can be an obstacle on the way to getting a flat in a TBS and may lead to abuse and distortion of the idea of social rental housing. Contribution at the level of 30 per cent in large cities often translates into dizzying amounts, exceeding the required minimum own contribution necessary to obtain mortgage credit for a similar apartment. This is a paradox, as TBSs were supposed to be an alternative for people who cannot afford a loan. On the website of the Warsaw City Hall we find information that in the newly-implemented investment project, the amount of contribution per square meter is “only” 2,805 złoty (i.e. 30 per cent of the cost of building the flat, which is 9,350 złoty per square meter). The future tenant of an apartment with a size of fifty square meters must therefore pay the contribution in the amount of one hundred and forty thousand złoty, and added to that, a deposit equivalent to one year’s rent. This places contribution, as an expense, somewhere between the amount of own contribution to the loan, and the purchase of an entire apartment. Of course, in the event of pulling out from the TBS, it is possible to redeem the contribution paid – furthermore, the amount is subjected to valorisation, which means that the actual sum redeemed is higher – therefore, it is sometimes (rightly) treated as a capital investment. Before you invest, though, you need to accumulate considerable funds, which in many cases makes taking out a loan necessary. ",

It was then that such housing estates first appeared in our country. The first Polish gated community was most probably an enclave of single-family houses, built in Piaseczno. Zbigniew Niemczycki, the real estate developer responsible for its construction, had returned from America not long before that. From overseas, he brought not only the idea for the estate being gated, but also for the houses – literally – to be put together from prefabricated elements.1 The gated community debate has gone through the stages of curiosity, surprise, anxiety, indignation, and finally, it seems, a kind of resignation. An impasse was reached: the professional community agrees that it is a harmful phenomenon both from the point of view of space and the functioning of society, but this consensus does not translate into material reality.

The fourth narrative implies the fifth one, which also concerns the community character of gated housing estates, although it points to the community as a tool of oppression.

The popularity of gated communities has made it more difficult to buy a new apartment in an open housing estate than in a gated one, but at the same time the gated community has lost its ennobling and exclusive character.

ICA led to the publication of the ISO standard on CPTED in January 2021 (ISO 22341:2021). Although the American version focuses on spatial issues, it also emphasizes the importance of a strong local community. In the second generation of CPTED rules (the first one contained spatial and technical solutions, also regarding access limitation), it was described, for example, how to organize a neighbourhood watch. It is difficult to shake off the impression that the proposed remedy may become a disease at some point. The problem was noticed, among others, by Bryan Lee Jr., a black designer from New Orleans who deals with the concept of ‘just city’. Lee believes that security mechanisms based on neighbourly control and the assumption that any person with antisocial intentions should feel uncomfortable may cause discomfort to anyone who looks different and does not conform to normative patterns or – what is particularly important in the United States – has a different coloured skin.18 The strategy promoted by the CPTED threatens to deepen the divisions between “us” and “them” and reinforce the not-in-my-backyard phenomenon, i.e. the opposition of residents to certain investments (for example shelters for people experiencing homelessness crisis, or counselling centres for people with addictions) in their immediate vicinity, although they do not deny that these facilities are needed.

After the stabilization of macro­ economic conditions, the financial sector was willing to offer mortgage loans. But the story of the mortgage loan needs to be related in conjunction with the changes in the Polish housing system. In the 1990s and early 2000s, it was not clear which way the latter would go. Various concepts were clashing – one was close to the German system, that is, with incentives to accumulate savings, and with a range of different titles to an apartment: in addition to ownership, there was the rental market, non-commercial i.e. subsidized rent, and social housing. That might have given us a chance to respond to the housing needs of different groups.

When weighing our own comfort and standard of living related to income, which also somehow more or less predictably grows, it was necessary to take into account the fact that the more we postpone the purchase of an apartment, the more we will have to pay for it, and the ratio between our income and the costs of the loan can only get worse.

In subjective experience, this means that since I cannot afford an apartment, I simply have to recognize that I must wait for something to become available within the family resource.

The Platforma Obywatelska (Civic platform party) government towards the end of their term in office, too late realized the necessity for the existence of home rental market. After the financial recession, it was already made clear that mortgage loans alone would not solve the housing problem – but now the second decade of the twenty-first century was coming to an end, and no programs had been launched that would have given the rental market a strong boost. The lack of alternatives means that the credit market has been growing dynamically all the time. ",

It did not arrive with the transition and the advent of neoliberalism; it had started earlier, but we only now understood its nature. The banks’ portfolios show that the value of loans to individual households is growing proportionally to the loans granted to entrepreneurs. In the global trend, household debt begins to affect the configuration of the financial sector. Banks are slowly ceasing to be the resource and the player that develops the production sector, and their customers are individual households who are not so much saving money, but getting into debt. We must remember that household debt is integrated into institutional systems. For instance, the debt of the entire Dutch society, which is higher than the country’s GDP, does not mean that the poor, indebted society must take out loans in large amounts. Note that households are getting into debt because they are encouraged to invest in the market. This phenomenon has been typical of the last twenty years; Poland and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have become part of it, and the political and economic transition in the region has coincided with the dynamics of this process. The most emblematic examples of this tendency are the stories of Ireland and Spain, the two countries that have modernized themselves thanks to EU accession and globalization. ",

Rental dominates: it is expensive, mainly due to limited supply, therefore it does not present an attractive alternative to ownership; also, its conditions are mostly determined by the landlord. As flats to rent are in short supply on the market, ownership remains the only option, while rental is a temporary condition.

Only the floor plan, which had been implemented in large-panel blocks of flats since the 1970s, has been slightly modified. Mere details separate the apartment from the People’s Republic of Poland era from its successor, product of real estate developers. Over time, the depth of the apartment’s communication route increased; therefore the area with direct exposure to natural light has decreased. The shape of the apartment has evolved from a square towards an increasingly elongated rectangle with a shorter outer wall – the only one where the windows can be placed. Balconies and loggias have been added to the regular standard. Corner windows are also growing in popularity, despite the fact that they are bending the rules of daylight analysis. The technical conditions precisely define the minimum time of daylight exposure in the apartment; therefore, architects calculate it down to the minute. Usually, they do not take into account the thickness of window frames, as a result, the muntin bar in the corner shades the room instead of illuminating it. However, this does not affect the calculations, which in turn allows architects and developers to increase the floor area ratio (i.e. the density of buildings). The wall separating the kitchen from the living room is gone – today the cooking is done in kitchen-annexes. In overcrowded apartments in the People’s Republic of Poland, the larger room often doubled as a bedroom; today it is sold primarily as a living room. ",

Technological development, allowing the acceleration of resource production, and the reduction of production costs, no longer serves the purpose of mass housing programs; instead, it is used to improve financial results of real estate developers and the institutions that are financing the construction projects. Its integration in design is not only about applying progressively better technologies, but it also involves a close union between the form and the market results. The result of land speculation (in 2020, on average, a quarter of the cost per one square meter of an apartment resulted from the cost of land) combined with the projected rates of return on investment directly dictate the shape and nature of a housing development. The latter, in a way, is a container for the products sold, which the individual apartments have become. Hence the idea of cities created in an Excel spreadsheet.

The idea of Wohnungsausstellung – an exhibition of architecture created as a living prototype and a model for a different, better formula for building apartments – was consciously adopted by the designers of the Wrocław housing estate. Apart from Żerniki, other attempts were made to build such districts, mainly in Warsaw: Warszawska Dzielnica Społeczna (Warsaw Social District, WDS), Jeziorki, and Osiedla Warszawy (Warsaw Estates).

Since it gives someone the opportunity to significantly “plump up” their investment, the competition forces others to also “squeeze as much out of their plots as possible”.

In such a system there may not be enough space for state-of-theart, good-practice design decisions. The difficulty with the resulting local plans concerns not even inappropriate urban planning parameters, but often, instead, it is their limited regulatory importance that is the problem. They do not contain appropriate provisions, or they formulate their guidelines so “loosely” that a stubborn investor will coerce an interpretation that is favourable to him, ruining the original concept on which the local plan was based.

One can reject in advance the option of using the normative of the People’s Republic of Poland, if only because of the changes in the lifestyle that have occurred over the last fifty years; these changes directly translate into completely different needs in the way that housing complexes are shaped.

I will use an example from the times of the Building Law Codification Commission, working on the Urban Planning and Construction Code (in 2013–2014). A group of professionals and masterminds planned to restore the standard, but while trying to formulate it, they came across some obstacles. A set of conditions emerged that did not match the most important development challenges – for example, members of the commission proposed making the permissible number of storeys dependent on the size of the city. As a result of Edward Gierek’s decision, there are elevenstorey blocks of flats in Słubice, with the population of 16 thousand, and they do not seem to have any impact on the urban problems of this city.

Moreover, many find positive aspects in it today, and derive from it the defective financing mechanism of social infrastructure by real estate developers – which only proves the extent of desperation of local governments who are lacking effective urban planning tools. Urban standards are seen as an undoubtedly positive aspect of the “lex developer” act – and rightly so – but attention should be paid to the way they are used in the application of this act. Typically, municipalities try to oppose the buildings proposed by investors that are inconsistent with local plans.

Although real estate development companies evidently abuse this argument in discussions about systemic changes, in this context it is an actual fear that the availability of new housing would decrease, and prices would increase due to the limited supply. Therefore, the standards alone are not enough to heal the situation. Associated legal mechanisms are needed in order to ensure the emergence of new infrastructure. Restoring the urban standard cannot be a one-off, “spot” reform out of context, but it must be aligned with a number of other changes to the system, especially in terms of financing urbanization. ",

For example, if the stop is located at the required distance from a residential building, and the kindergarten is also located at a required distance, but in the opposite direction, then the functionality of such a system for the resident will be limited, despite its being in accordance with the regulations. Common sense should be used in the context of urban planning standards – and this is something that is difficult to achieve when it comes to applying and interpreting generally applicable law. If there is no school at the appropriate distance in a new housing estate, regulations may require its construction even in a situation where just a little further, in another housing estate whose population have already “matured”, and which has good public transport access, there is a school that is only partially used.

It would be impossible to argue that this principle is being consistently implemented at present. The blame lies chiefly with the lingering, perverse mechanism of issuing a “decision on land development conditions” (also known as zoning decisions). However, the lack of consistency does not invalidate the importance of the principle, on the contrary – there are all the more arguments for it. Even though the announced EU regulations limiting the possibility of additional soil sealing have not yet come to pass, some countries, with their actions, have already embarked in this direction, treating it as one of the mechanisms to counteract climate change.

The priorities of climate-responsible and economically responsible urban planning in Poland should focus on precisely those areas. Instead of creating new “ideal” housing estates, it is first necessary to take care of such spatial planning that on the one hand would minimize the area intended for land sealing, and on the other hand, would repair the current dysfunctional structure of suburban built environment. It is about functional and environmentally rational filling the gaps in chaotically dispersed buildings, and an attempt to transform them into sensible housing complexes with access to services and efficient public transport connection to central cities.

Wherever the conditions are not met, the local government would have to build the missing schools, kindergartens, widen the streets and sidewalks, launch public transport? Undoubtedly, such legal norm would join the litany of useless laws and generally ignored regulations, and after years of zoning free-for-all and chaotic dispersal of built environment, it would lead to many difficult dilemmas. I do not believe that we are mentally or financially ready, for example, to demolish some of the buildings in a development that is too dense in order to fill the deficit of green areas, although probably, in the future, we could also think about that. Moreover, in some cases an obligation to conform to a rigid standard would be simply unfair. Why should a local community bear the above-standard costs of supplementing the infrastructure for people who consciously decided to live in locations where such infrastructure was missing and where it was never planned in the first place? On the other hand, even without statutory provisions, local government officials know where in their area there are deficiencies in terms of infrastructure or access to public services. This knowledge is communicated in letters, petitions, or protests of dissatisfied residents, yet local authorities do not keep up in terms of meeting these expectations. The essence of the problem lies not so much in the lack of regulations on adapting the existing buildings to specific standards, as in the lack of financing. This is an element of the aforementioned fundamental omission in Polish urban planning regulations – the lack of rational and effective economic mechanisms that would ensure the formation of the whole, complete city, i.e. residential development with parallel implementation of infrastructure and guaranteed access to public services and green areas.

Several years’ work led to the creation of an organizational framework necessary for the implementation of the venture. Although the project was guided by the idea of cooperation, its proponents decided not to incorporate under the cooperative law. The limited liability company model was chosen – because it is an uncomplicated legal form, and it does not require tons of documentation and by-laws. The biggest obstacles to obtaining commercial credit were the company’s lack of experience in conducting similar investment projects, and the tenants, who would become a problem in the event of the bank taking over the building.

The opposition won the autumn 2019 municipal elections, Gergely Karácsony from the Dialogue party became mayor, and the opposition also formed governing coalitions in many city districts. The ruling party’s failure in local elections, however, meant it fortified its centralising tendencies, further limiting the cities’ autonomy. The government is primarily trying to limit budgets. This year’s pandemic was a welcome pretext that allowed the government to confiscate large sums from cities’ budgets as part of extensive extraordinary measures. The eighth and ninth district, for instance, where the housing crisis in Budapest is at its worst, lost hundreds of millions of forints intended for the renovation of municipal apartments and aid for poor families, as reported by Balkan Insight.

The core of the institute’s plan lies in broadening the segment of available rental housing in three basic ways: through better and more effective care for the current housing stock, by establishing a non-profit agency to administer the municipal housing stock and expand it, and through support of alternative forms of ownership (condominiums, cooperatives, and others). If the city were to follow this strategy, the proportion of municipal or agency housing would rise to 12 per cent, up to 30 per cent in the long-term. At this stage, however, all these are just proposals on paper. ",

The city hall is therefore organising participative meetings in selected localities, and, according to Stasselová, they have been successful in convincing the inhabitants of neighbouring properties that municipal apartments will not be detrimental to their quality of life. A distaste for municipal development is also rooted in the stereotypes about rental housing mentioned above. “People often think that problematic individuals will inhabit these houses.

The current waiting time is four to seven years. “If someone finds themselves in a difficult situation, God forbid a critical one, they have no chance to get an apartment regardless of whether they conform to the current criteria or not.” The regulations for distributing municipal apartments date back to 2000 and they do not correspond to the needs of today.

But it’s hard to trace these connections from a layman’s perspective,” explains Szolgayová. “The neoliberal ideological principles of the 1980s left a huge mark on the first attempts of post-socialist countries at approaching the issue of housing.

After the abolition of private ownership and the nationalization of land, market prices ceased to apply, but unrestrained spatial development of cities began: the existing urban structures were interfered with or replaced with new buildings.

Efforts to increase the number of flats have resulted in the prefabrication of several standardized forms of a tower block.

I merely wish to compare concepts and tendencies that we suppose indifferent to the quality of living today. The centralization of Bratislava’s function as a capital in the last century, and the lack of a motorway connection to Košice, the main metropolis of eastern Slovakia and the second largest city in the country, have led and continue to lead to a constant influx of new residents and a permanent housing shortage. Apartments offered on the market meet only the basic demand, whereas their quality and size turn out to be of secondary importance. Residential units meet only the minimum requirements in terms of standards and norms, and they are built as cheaply as possible. We are falling into a vicious circle: new residents do not establish ties with the city, and the city does not offer them a living space that would foster a bond.

The necessity to economically manage financial resources, the problems with operating machinery in more hilly terrain or between the existing buildings, and arguments related to the need of maintaining agricultural land slowed down the development.5 The optimal solution was to increase density of the planned housing estates, but urban concepts were often implemented in part only.

Thermal insulation became an indispensable element of any renovation, a way to improve the quality of housing and a showcase product of capitalism. The marketing was based on presenting thermo-modernization as an investment that would make it possible to save on maintenance costs in the future, but its negative side-effects were ignored (attaching polystyrene to an uneven, brittle base promotes the appearance of mould; amateurish fixing causes the insulation to move away from the wall, which reduces its effectiveness; shoddy finish does not drain moisture, it collects dust and is an ideal substrate for fungi). The polystyrene insulation system had practically been promoted to the rank of a norm in building renovation. In housing estates, criticized for their uniformization, a standardized and simple solution was used, which was supposed to be the answer to many problems at once.

The press in the 1960s clearly appreciated not only the kitchen as a full-fledged room, but also as a symbol of the position of women in society.

In new designs for apartments or single-family houses, often offering a typical interior layout, the average size of the kitchen area has not increased over the last thirty years. If the optimization of the interior layout and the minimization of the space – as far as it is possible within the norm – continues, we will soon have to cook in windowless kitchens. Underestimating and disregarding the kitchen leads us to the question of whether we still consider cooking together as a family to be superfluous, and whether we will be content with the alternatives in the form of fast food and semi-finished products offered by the neoliberal system.

Until the 1960s, it came as no surprise to anyone that the living room also served as a bedroom. The designers of the new housing estates had ambitions to raise the standard of flats and allocate a separate space for sleep, thus making life easier for the residents. There were standards and indicators for the number of square meters and additional space allocations (a cellar, a storeroom or a basement) per tenant. The modern trend of reducing the size of apartments has led to a situation where basements are an above-standard privilege, and entrance corridors are door-wide. There are doubts as to whether the bedroom has to be a separate room, and in cramped apartments there is often not enough space for a piece of furniture that would be intended only for sleeping. A separate bedroom, or even a space where a bed can fit, is now considered a luxury. The market price of an apartment with a bedroom is now about ten times the price at which it was built. ",

The continuous growth of prices often forces tenants to share a flat. Even if there are still some standards and minimum requirements for housing in the designing process, in reality they are not being followed. Having too many tenants constitutes a form of intensification; this, in turn, reduces the quality of the apartment, but also of the environment. Public services and transportation become inefficient. Traces of Slovakia’s centralization and the role of Bratislava played in the last century are still visible. People from the eastern part of the country are constantly flowing into the capital, and consequently there is a shortage of housing.

This city consists of a mosaic of (non)urban concepts complemented by a mixture of construction permits, assorted new building façades created by various architects, extensions, renovations, and old housing estates “tweaked” and “upgraded” by thermomodernization companies. This hybrid is gradually joined by satellite housing estates, urban concepts of living in single-family houses on the outskirts of the city. It is difficult to tell whether young families move out of the city in order to achieve their dreams of their own garden, or whether they are looking for a cheaper alternative to living in the capital. Small houses with a plot of land in suburban municipalities are roughly 30 per cent cheaper than similarly sized apartments within the city’s administrative boundaries. However, it is difficult to speak of the benefits pertaining to the comfort of living in a single-family house, the way we used to imagine it. Problems are generated by contemporary spatial planning, which enables the creation of agglomeration clusters. Seemingly they look like a whole, an urban organism, but they were created without a plan, they lack services, adequate infrastructure, or public spaces: a market square, playgrounds, green areas. Their designers are selling a compact “American dream”: a single-family house on a small plot separated from former agricultural land, again with the minimum parameters required by the housing standards.

The Pólus Center opened as a third-generation shopping mall in 1996 at the northern end of the Újpalota-Páskomliget housing estate. According to a 2004 survey, 35 per cent of the customers came to the shopping centre on foot.14 We can therefore conclude that at least as many of the residents of the estate used the mall on a daily basis. When the new shopping mall, with a wide range of services, became accessible within a walking distance, the central commercial zone of the housing estate began to deteriorate. In less than ten years, the former centre of the area became a hot pit for criminal activities. Therefore, from 2010 onwards, eliminating crime and violence became one of the main goals in the Újpalota estate. The problems were addressed by reviving the area’s central functions in the framework of the EU-subsidised social rehabilitation program. We could argue that the Újpalota estate represents the worst-case scenario, resulting from the local absorption of the purchasing power. Kelenföld estate, where the inhabitants have better social background, the problems are less pronounced. Still, even there, experts’ assistance is desirable in creating proper living conditions – in an urban area, which should include stimulating public space uses through right development choices and architectural solutions.

This should have a positive impact on the economic sustainability, but also vitalize the community life of the typically ageing housing estate. Tamás László, architect, parliamentarian, former mayor of Újpalota, has a holistic notion of the intensification of large-scale postwar areas: “Today we need to look at the extensive city form of Budapest, examine the transport network and suburbanization. Based on those experiences we are facing significant deterioration in the energy balance. From this point of view, it is interesting to appreciate the regeneration of housing estates, even by intensification. Expanding the range of apartment types, resettling of young people would be more profitable in the housing estates than sending families to the agglomeration where there is no infrastructure, no public institutions, where transport problems break the families’ daily life.” ",

A much more significant question is how the economically favourable density could become perceptible in open space usage. For this purpose, there are many investments in the development of public squares, community gardens, playgrounds, and large scaled recreational zones in each area. Integration of new functions in Újpalota contributed significantly to a better perception of density conditions. The Boldog Salkaházi Sára church with its multifunctional spaces and the KIKÖTŐ youth centre with a semi-private garden appointed new destinations in the unused open space that can establish a “critical mass” of passers-by with the promise of public safety in housing estates.

On the other hand, we found it very positive that the municipality is thinking about how to revitalize private condominiums.” How can we, architects accredited by local municipalities, design extensions for a block of flats with private owned apartments if the owners do not have the financial capacity for its implementation, nor is it certain that each inhabitant is interested in the conversion (i.e. expectations can vary from storey to storey)? Tamás László considers legislation almost incapable of dealing with such complex problems: “My basic proposition is that there is no easy solution to a complex problem. Some programs require complex solutions.” But who will make the effort to elaborate the legal solution, if the legislators in Hungary recently restricted the restructuring of postwar areas even more – for example by constraining transfer of ownership right to the state-owned or municipal land?
