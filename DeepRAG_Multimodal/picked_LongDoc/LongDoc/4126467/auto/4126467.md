# DRAINAGE  

# 5.01 GENERAL STATEMENT:  

These specifications are intended to meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.  

While it is intended to permit alternative methods of analysis and solution of drainage problems and to provide for other methods for those situations which do not lend themselves to solution by the following criteria, such alternative methods shall be based upon accepted engineering principles and shall produce results which achieve the product intended by the following specifications.  

It is the general purpose of these standards that waters generated by storms, springs, or other sources be contained on the area to be developed or carried through a system of waterways and conduits and disposed of in such a manner that adjacent improvements, existing or projected, will be free from flood hazard. Flood hazard is defined as potential damage by water having sufficient depth or velocity to damage improvements or to deposit or scour soil other than within channels.  

Each improvement shall be designed so as to not increase the rate of flow of water onto adjacent properties. An exception to this may be permitted by the Director if there are adequate downstream facilities provided to handle the total flow without adverse affect on other properties. In this event, the Developer may be required to participate in the cost of said facilities and/or obtain easements or other rights as needed.  

Unless an individual project required diversion of water to conform to a comprehensive drainage plan, water shall be received and discharged at the locations that existed prior to development and as nearly as possible in the manner that existed prior to development. Should diversion be required, sufficient work shall be done upstream and/or downstream to provide all affected properties at least the same level of flood protection as existed prior to the diversion.  

At the discretion of the Director, any project may be required to pond or retard all runoff generated by the project. Owner-Developers should expect to pond all runoff from new projects located in areas of the City where existing drainage facilities are already overloaded, where ponding is designed as the method of runoff disposal in the Master Drainage Plan, or where planned facilities do not yet exist.  

These standards are intended to provide general and some detailed design criteria. Most design details are left to the responsibility of the Consultant, subject to approval by the Director, and may be handled by following good engineering practice.  

The design standards contained herein are minimal and alternates may be approved, provided such alternates are to a higher standard than those set forth. Exceptions to these standards may be allowed by the Director when it can be determined that such exceptions are in the best interest of the City.  

All drainage facilities shall be maintained by the City, a homeowner's association or an approved maintenance district. The Developer shall complete arrangements for maintenance prior to filing of the final subdivision or parcel map.  

All drainage facilities for new construction or redevelopment of individual properties not in an approved maintenance district or homeowner’s association must comply with the City of Grover Beach Standards for Individual Lot Runoff and be maintained by the owner and retained on site. See section 5.06, G. and Standard Drawings D.11 through D.14.  

# 5.02 ALIGNMENT AND CAPACITY:  

A. Capacity - Special provisions shall be made by the Consultant within the drainage system to insure that the inlet flow line elevations and the capacity of the drainage system are such that the system may be extended to serve and properly handle the entire drainage basin at the time of ultimate development, under 100-year storm conditions. This is to include the entire upstream portion of the basin outside the development, regardless of existing conditions.  

B. Alignment - The diversion of natural drainage will be allowed only within the limits of the proposed improvement. All natural drainage must leave the improved area at its original horizontal and vertical alignment and with approximately the same discharge velocity as existed prior to development, unless adequate downstream facilities exist or a special agreement indemnifying and approved by the City has been executed with the adjoining property owners.  

The general location for storm drainage lines shall be six feet northerly or westerly of the centerline of a street.  

Other general requirements for storm drains are as follows:  

1. Storm drainage lines are to be parallel with the centerline of streets unless impracticable. The designer should avoid meandering, offsetting, and unnecessary angular changes (none to exceed $90^{\circ}$ ).  

2. Provide junctions between converging lines in such a manner as will minimize losses and utilize available velocity head, and locate the centerlines of the influent and effluent lines so that they will be approximately in the same plane and be as nearly as possible parallel to the resultant vector of the converging lines.  

3. The vertical alignment shall be so designed to eliminate any ponding within the drainage system, other than where sump pumps or basins are provided.  

4. Existing open ditches, paved channels, and swale flows shall be maintained as nearly as possible in their existing alignment.  

5.03 EASEMENTS:  

Drainage facilities must be located in a public street or within a drainage easement. Necessary dedication of an easement for lines to be constructed on private property must be completed before the improvement will be approved for construction.  

Where a minor improvement of a drainage facility falls on adjacent property, written permission from the adjacent property owners for such construction and a copy of the approval of the adjacent owners shall be submitted to the Director prior to approval of the improvement plans.

Capacity Requirement Computation:  

1. On occasions when the Director requires all runoff from a project to be ponded, the volume of the ponding basin shall be calculated as follows: 0.33 ft. x area x coefficient of runoff Examples: 6,000 square feet residential lot, $35\%$ coverage: (0.33) (6,000 sq. ft.) $(0.35)=693$ cubic feet storage required. or, 10 acre development, $40\%$ coverage: (0.33) (10 acres) $(0.40)=1.32\$ acre feet storage required.  

In addition to the above criteria, ponding basins for subdivisions shall be designed so the design water surface is one foot below the lowest inlet gutter elevation. The basin shall also have at least one foot of freeboard. The inlet structure is to be designed to convey the 10-year flow without ponding and the 100-year flow without exceeding the top of curb. Ponding basins for individual residences may be configured so that the design capacity occurs at pond overflow.  

Note: Use of pervious surfaces such as pervious paving is an acceptable way to reduce the impervious coverage used in runoff calculations. In that case, pervious paving and pervious base shall pass a minimum of 3.2 - inches per hour.  

2. Retarding Basin - Retarding basins require special design considerations. The Consultant is to have the design method approved by the Director prior to designing the facilities.

The top of the smaller pipe shall be no lower than the top of the larger pipe(s).  

The location and installation requirements for any sanitary sewer to be installed in an existing street or road shall be obtained from the Director prior to submission of the plans.  

Location of sewer lines in easements shall be kept to a minimum. Whenever possible, sewers shall be placed in the public roadway. Where sewer lines are located within an easement, the easement shall conform to the following:  

1. Be dedicated on the record map. 2. Be dedicated to and accepted by the City of Grover Beach by an Official Record and Resolution. 3. The minimum width of any easement for sanitary sewer purposes shall be 10 feet or twice the depth of the sewer. In cases of difficult terrain or sewer line deeper than 5 feet, the required easement width shall be increased. All easements shall include right of ingress and egress over adjoining property for maintenance, replacement and operation. B. Alignment - Sewerage systems shall be designed so as to have a minimum horizontal curvature. No vertical curvature will be allowed.  

Whenever possible sewer lines shall be laid out in a straight line between structures. Curved sewer lines may be allowed under the following conditions:  

1. All curve data shall be shown on the plans and the sewer is concentric with street centerline. 2. Minimum radius of curvature and joint deflections shall be as recommended by the pipe manufacturer and approved by the Engineer.  

Whenever it is essential that curved alignment be used, a radius of not less than 200 feet shall be required, but shall be greater whenever possible.  

C. Special Construction in Areas of Conflict Between Water and Sewer Lines - In the interest of public health and to minimize the possibility of contamination of the public water supply, the following special construction requirements shall be met at any time that the separation between water and sewer lines is less than that described. These requirements apply to construction of a water main, sewer main, sewer lateral, or any other type construction causing the separation to be less than that indicated. All special construction required herein is to be discussed thoroughly with the Director prior to starting any work and is subject to the Director's approval.  

If a sewer main or sewer house lateral crosses below a water main and is within Zone A (as shown on Standard Drawing S.7), the sewer line is to be constructed of or replaced by a single piece of SDR 35 pipe. The single piece of pipe shall be centered over the water main. The length to be replaced shall be as necessary to provide plastic pipe for the sewer main or sewer lateral with no joints within the critical zone.  

If a sewer main or sewer house lateral crosses above a water main and is within a critical zone (as shown on Standard Drawing S.7), the sewer main is to be constructed of or replaced by a single piece of DR 14, C-900 pipe. The length to be replaced shall be as necessary to provide unjointed plastic pipe for the sewer main that is within the critical zone.  

6.05 DEPTH AND SIZE:  

A. Depth - The normal design depth of a sanitary sewer system shall be such as to obtain a cover of 36 inches for the house service lateral at the property line or 54 inches of cover in the street whichever is deeper. Under certain topographic conditions lesser depths may be allowed by the Director.  

B. Size - The normal minimum sewer main size shall be 8 inches inside diameter. Six (6) inch diameter lines may be used on certain short lines where no possibility of line extensions exists, subject to the Director's approval.  

6.06 MANHOLES:  

Normal maximum spacing for manholes shall be 400 feet. Where the locations of two manholes are determined by intersecting lines, the distance between intervening manholes shall be approximately equal. A sewer on a curved alignment with a radius of less than 400 feet shall have manholes spaced at a maximum of 300 feet, or adjusted to fit the individual case. Upstream ends of sewer mains shall terminate at manholes.  

The maximum spacing of manholes on trunk sewer lines shall be as follows:  

12" to 24" diameter 500 feet   
27" to 36" diameter 600 feet  

The spacing of manholes on trunk sewer lines larger than 36 inches in diameter shall be determined for each individual case.  

Drop Manholes - Whenever the vertical distance between the inverts of sewer lines coming into a manhole exceeds 15 inches, a standard drop manhole shall be constructed.  

6.07 CLEANOUTS:  

A cleanout may be used in lieu of a manhole for any stub line with a length of 200 feet or less. Any line more than 200 feet in length shall have a manhole at the end. Lateral sewers installed to a subdivision line for future extension shall have a cleanout at the end, if there are any house service lines attached to it, and if it is not over 200 feet in length. Lines longer than 200 feet shall terminate in a manhole with a stub for future extension.  

# 6.08 HOUSE SERVICE LINES:  

In all new subdivision work, the house service lines from the sewer to the property line shall be installed at the time the sewer is constructed. Each house service line shall be referenced to the plan stationing. Minimum size of any sanitary lateral or side sewer to serve individual residences, commercial structures, etc., shall be nominal 4 inches inside diameter. Actual size of laterals larger than 4 inches shall be determined by fixture unit requirements as per the current edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code.  

# 6.09 SEWAGE LIFT STATIONS, FORCE MAINS AND TREATMENT PLANTS:  

All special structures such as treatment plants shall meet all requirements of the State Regional Water Quality Control Board, State and County Health Departments and the Director. Special structures and situations, such as pump stations, pressure lines and sags, etc., shall require special considerations and approval by the Director.  

Whenever the design of a sanitary sewerage system includes the necessity of a sewage lift station and a force main the following data shall be submitted for tentative approval before plans are submitted:  

A. Sewage Lift Station - Minimum distance from a lift station to any residence shall be 50 feet except with advance approval of the Director for the specific case.  

No lift station shall be constructed with bypasses which will bypass any effluent into any stream or water course.  

The design shall include computations for the pumps, the type of pump to be used, and a plot plan showing the dimensions of the site and its location with respect to homes or other structures.  

An air injection system shall be included in the design.  

An alarm system, which meets the approval of the Director, shall be provided on all sewage lift stations.  

B. Force Mains - The size and type of pipe to be used and a tentative alignment shall be submitted. Design shall include fatigue life analysis if PVC pipe is used.  

6.10 KIND OF PIPE:  

All sanitary sewer lines shall be SDR 35 PVC, or as approved by the Director. 6.11 MATERIALS:  

A. General - All material that is to become a permanent part of any sanitary sewer or appurtenant structure, shall conform to the requirements for the particular material as set forth in these specifications. The Contractor shall supply any and all certificates of compliance, certified test results or shall perform tests as required to assure the Director that the material being incorporated into the work has met the requirements as specified. Approval of the Director shall be required for use of material not listed in these standards.  

B. Pipe & Pipe Joining Material - All pipe or conduits shall be of the size, material and strength as shown on the plans. All pipefittings shall be marked or stamped with the trade brand name of the manufacturer and strength or class of pipe. All pipe shall be designed to withstand all internal or external loads applied. Supporting strength of conduits as installed to safely carry imposed gravity loads and superimposed loads (including a suitable factor of safety) shall be determined by use of the Marston formula.  

# 6.12 PLASTIC PIPE:  

Plastic pipe and fittings shall be new, first quality pipe and shall comply with the specifications for ASTM D3034-SDR 35. Plastic pipe joints shall comply with ASTM Designation B3212. The only allowable variation from the above recommended practices will be as definitely specified in other sections of these standards or by written approval of the Director.  

6.13 DUCTILE IRON PIPE:  

All ductile iron pipe and fittings for sewers shall be at least thickness Class 50 water main pipe with a heat cured epoxy lining and conform to AWWA standards. Joints shall be approved type mechanical joints.  

6.14 ASBESTOS-CEMENT PIPE:  

Asbestos Cement Pipe will not be allowed.  

# 6.15 FORCE MAIN PIPE:  

Pipe used in the construction of force mains and in critical zones per S.7 shall be either ductile iron or AWWA C900 PVC.  

# 6.16 CASTINGS:  

All castings for manhole rings and covers, cleanout frames and covers, or other purposes, shall be cast iron meeting the requirements of Specifications ASTM Designation A48, Class 25. The quality shall be such that a blow from a hammer will produce an indentation on a rectangular edge of the castings, without flaking the metal. Before leaving the foundry, all castings shall be thoroughly cleaned.  

6.17 INSTALLATION OF SEWERS:  

A. Lines and Grades - All lines and grades will be given by the Consultant. The Director shall be informed 24 hours in advance of the times and places at which work is to be done in order that lines and grades may be inspected and necessary measurements made with a minimum of inconvenience and delay. All stakes and marks once given shall be fully protected and preserved. Flow line elevations shall be established at all changes in grade and at 50 foot intervals. B. Trench Widths - The maximum width of trench measured at the top of pipe shall be governed in all cases by the size of the pipe to be installed therein.  

The following table showing relationship between pipe size and width of trench shall be strictly adhered to and any deviation therefrom must first be approved in writing by the Director.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Nominal Size of Pipe</td><td>Width of Trench</td></tr><tr><td>4 inch</td><td>20 inches</td></tr><tr><td>6 inch</td><td>24 inches</td></tr><tr><td>8 inch</td><td>24 inches</td></tr><tr><td>10 inch</td><td>27 inches</td></tr><tr><td>12 inch</td><td>29 inches</td></tr><tr><td>15 inch</td><td>33 inches</td></tr><tr><td>18 inch</td><td>38 inches</td></tr><tr><td>21 inch</td><td>42 inches</td></tr><tr><td>24 inch</td><td>46 inches</td></tr></table></body></html>  

For pipe larger than 24 inches in diameter, the trench width shall not exceed the outside diameter of the pipe plus 16 inches. The sides of the trench shall be as nearly vertical as possible in the material through which it is passing. If the width of the trench at the ground surface becomes excessive, the Director may require solid sheeting and bracing.  

C. Excavation for Sewers - Unless otherwise specified, the excavation for sewer pipe shall be an open trench, excavated to 3 inches below the outside diameter of the bell. This undercutting shall be refilled with suitable bedding material as specified in the section on pipe bedding, thoroughly compacted into place. Where the trench is in granular or sandy material, the pipe may be bedded in the native material in lieu of importing bedding material providing it complies with the specification for bedding material. The Director shall determine the suitability of the native material.  

When the trench is in an existing paved area the pavement shall be sawed ahead of the trenching operations. The proper tools and equipment shall be used in marking and breaking so that the pavement will be cut accurately on neat and parallel lines at the width required for the trench, except that when in the opinion of the Director the remaining paving has been damaged, an additional 12 inches shall be cut from each side to the approval of the Director. Existing pavement shall be sawed to a neat line 6 inches wider on each side than the trench width. Whenever the bottom of the trench is soft, yielding, or unsuitable as a foundation for the pipe, or a wye is being cut into an existing sewer main, 8" clean pea gravel shall be rammed into the soft material until, in the opinion of the Director, a suitable condition is achieved. If such treatment does not provide a proper foundation, the unsuitable material shall be removed to a depth determined by the Director such that replacement with bedding material will provide a stable foundation.  

When water is encountered, the trench shall be kept de-watered until laying and joining of the pipe and placing of the bedding material has been completed, inspected, and approved. The Contractor shall place not less than 6 inches of $2^{1/2^{\mathfrak{n}}}$ maximum size rock below the required bedding material or otherwise de-water the trench in a manner which has not received prior approval of the Director. Ground water pumped from the trench shall be disposed of in such a manner as will not cause or be a menace to the public. The manner employed to dispose of water pumped from an excavation shall be subject to the approval of the Director.  

D. Bracing and Shoring - As required by the California Department of Occupational Safety and Health, CAL-OSHA, sufficient bracing and shoring shall be installed in trenches to insure the safety of workmen, and to protect and facilitate the work. Where practicable all such bracing and shoring shall be removed from the trench as the backfilling proceeds.  

E. Tunneling - Tunneling shall not be permitted unless approved by the Director. F. Laying Sewer Pipe - The pipe shall be laid in conformity to the prescribed line and grade and each pipe length checked to the grade lines. Three consecutive points shown on the same rate of slope shall be used in common in order to detect any variation from a straight grade. In case any such discrepancy exists, the work shall be stopped and the discrepancy immediately reported to the Director. In addition, a string line shall be used in the bottom of the trench to insure proper alignment and grade.  

Pipe shall be laid continuously upgrade with the bell of the pipe forward. Each length of pipe shall be laid on a firm bed and shall have a true bearing for the entire length. No wedging or blocking up of the pipe will be permitted.  

Both bell and spigot shall be clean before the joint is made, and care shall be taken that nothing but the joint-making material enters the joints.  

When, for any reason, pipe laying is discontinued for an hour or more, the open end of each line shall be closed with a water-tight stopper.  

The Contractor's attention is called to the required use of short lengths of sewer pipe to provide curves, flexibility, and prevent cracking or shearing failures. The use of short lengths of pipe is particularly required but not necessarily limited to these locations: (1) inlets and outlets to all manholes and (2) horizontal curvilinear sewers.  

G. Pipe to be Placed by Boring or Jacking - The work contemplated under this heading consists of placing ductile iron pipe or other pipe of approved material, in a conductor pipe, under a paved roadway, street, or railroad to a true line and grade as shown on the plans, by means of boring or jacking operations. The equipment and method of operation shall be approved by the Director before proceeding with the work.  

The excavation for the boring operation shall be kept to a minimum, but shall be of sufficient dimensions to satisfactorily complete the work. If so required, bracing and shoring shall be provided to adequately protect the workmen and the roadway or railroad.  

The conductor pipe shall be placed closely behind and in conjunction with the boring operation. The bored hole shall not be more than two inches in diameter larger than the conductor pipe. Guide rails shall be accurately set to line and grade so as to achieve close adherence to the line and grade shown on the plans.  

The pipe to be placed inside the conductor pipe shall have non-rigid joints and shall be installed by the use of suitable centering devices. Sand/slurry water shall then be pumped into the conductor pipe to completely fill the angular space around the pipe for its full length.  

# H. Trench Backfill  

1. Bedding material, approved by the Director and meeting the minimum standards listed below, shall be deposited and compacted to $90\%$ relative compaction in the trench uniformly on both sides of the pipe for the full width of the trench and to a depth of 6 inches over the top of the pipe.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Sand Equivalent</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Sieve Size</td><td>Percentage Passing Sieve</td></tr><tr><td>1"</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>No. 4</td><td>80-100</td></tr><tr><td>No.200</td><td>0-15</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The sand equivalent of 30 for bedding shall also be required outside of the roadway prism.  

2. The balance of the backfill shall contain no rocks, stones or boulders in excess of 4 inches in its greatest dimension, and shall be free from all deleterious matter. It shall be compacted to a relative compaction of $95\%$ to the finish grade. Ponding or puddling will be permitted only at the express permission of the Director. The backfill under and around any and all pipes shall be thoroughly consolidated before any additional material is placed.  

3. Compaction methods must be carried out so no damage or displacement of the pipe results. 4. Any trenches improperly backfilled, or where settlement occurs, shall be reopened to the depth required for proper compaction then refilled and compacted with the surface restored to the required grade and compacted and smoothed off. 5. All waste material shall be disposed of outside of the City right of way or as approved by the Director. I. Trench Jetting - If this method of placing trench backfill is permitted by the Director, backfill material shall be water soaked with suitable pipe jets approved by the Director.  

All "bridges" in the backfill material shall be completely broken down during the jetting process. No jetting operations will be allowed that will, in the opinion of the Director, jeopardize in any manner the stability of the sewer line in the trench.  

Jetting operations done any time except during regular working hours shall have prior approval of the Director.  

J. Manholes - Manholes shall be watertight structures constructed by placing precast concrete sections on a poured concrete base. Poured-in-place manholes shall not be used unless specifically approved by the Director.  

1. Temporary covers of steel plate of sufficient size and thickness to adequately cover the opening shall be placed on the cone until the pavement is completed. Suitable locating ribs shall be welded to the underside of the cover to hold it in place during the grading and paving operations.  

2. When adjusting an existing manhole to grade, and the total depth of the throat from the top of the frame to the bottom of the throat exceeds 18 inches, the upper portion of the manhole shall be removed to the first full-size manhole section. The upper portion shall then be reconstructed as outlined above.  

3. Manholes shall be tested for water tight integrity, either jointly with testing of sewer line or as separate units, in accordance with Section 6.17M, Testing Sewer Lines of these Standards and Specifications. The allowable leakage for one manhole shall not exceed 1 gallon during a 2-hour test period.  

K. House Service Lateral - House service laterals shall be constructed as shown on the standard drawings.  

If it becomes necessary to locate a house service lateral less than 50 feet from a well, it shall be constructed of C900, PVC Class 150.  

Whenever house service laterals are to be installed as part of the contract for the construction of the main sewer, the use of saddles will not be permitted.  

That portion of any house service lateral to be placed under an existing curb and gutter shall be done by tunneling. Cutting of the existing curb and gutter will not be permitted. Existing sidewalk shall be neatly cut and replaced.  

All house service laterals shall be considered as part of the lateral sewers for the purpose of the hydrostatic test as set forth in Section 6.17M of these Standards and Specifications.  

The location of house service laterals shall be permanently indicated by embedding the letter "S" in the curb directly above the line. In new subdivisions when the house service laterals are installed before the curb is constructed, it shall be the sewer Contractor's responsibility to place the "S" in the curb after it is poured. When house service laterals are constructed in existing easements or streets where curbing does not exist, a 2" x 2" x 36" construction grade redwood stake shall be driven in the ground to within 2 inches of the surface directly above the service line at the property line and a "S" stamped in the top. Every house service lateral shall be so marked before final acceptance will be given on any job.  

L. Connection to Existing Manholes - Connections to existing manholes shall be made by carefully coring an opening in the wall of the manhole, inserting the end of the pipe through the opening flush with the inside wall, and packing the opening around the pipe with a stiff mix of cement mortar, thoroughly compacted to form a watertight connection. A rubber ring water stop shall be used. The mortar shall be trowelled smooth and flush with the interior surface of the manhole. Channelizing of the flow through the manhole shall conform to the details shown on the standard drawings for new manholes.  

The Contractor shall notify the Director 24 hours in advance before any connection is made to existing structures. The Contractor shall schedule the work so that interruption of flow is held to a minimum.  

M. Testing of Sewer Lines - Prior to final approval, all sewer lines shall be tested for leakage by standard hydrostatic or low pressure air test. In addition, sewers shall be T.V. inspected with equipment which produces a color VHS tape with on-screen distance readout of 0.1 foot increments. All sags greater than $1/_{2}$ inch or other visible defects shall be repaired. After T.V. inspection the sewer shall be gauged with a mandrel of $92.5\%$ diameter. Sewers deflected more than $7.5\%$ shall be repaired to less than $7.5\%$ deflection. Air test shall be made after T.V. and mandrel tests.

N. Air Test Procedure - Each section of sanitary sewer between two successive manholes shall be tested by plugging all pipe outlets with suitable test plugs. Air shall be slowly added until the internal pressure is raised to 4.0 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The compressor used to add air to the pipe shall have a blow-off valve set at 5 psig to assure that at no time the internal pressure in the pipe exceeds 5 psig. The internal pressure of 4 psig shall be maintained for at least 2 minutes to allow the air temperature to stabilize after which the air supply shall be disconnected and the pressure allowed to decrease to 3.5 psig. The time in minutes that is required for the internal air pressure to drop from 3.5 psig to 3.0 psig shall be measured and the results compared with the values tabulated below.

If the pressure drop from 3.5 psig to 3.0 psig occurs in less time than the above tabulated or calculated values, the pipe shall be repaired and, if necessary, replaced, re-laid and retested including T.V., mandrel and air tests, at the Contractor's expense until the joints and pipe shall hold satisfactorily under this test. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, air test equipment, and all other materials for making the required tests at Contractor's own expense. After the sewer lines have been properly backfilled to a depth where additional backfilling will not disturb the position of the pipe, all sections shall be tested. In no case shall the required minimum backfill be less than 4 feet above the top of the pipe before subjecting the line to the test. The Contractor shall supply all equipment, labor, material and perform all tests as required prior to final approval.  

2. Hydrostatic Test Procedure (Alternate to Air Testing) - A section of sewer line shall be prepared for testing by plugging the upper side of the downstream manhole and all openings in the upstream manhole except the downstream opening. Where grades are slight, two or more sections between manholes may be tested at once. Where grades are steep, and excessive test heads would result by testing from one manhole to another, test tees the full size of the main shall be installed at intermediate points so the maximum head on any section under test will not exceed 12 feet.  

The section of sewer line prepared as above shall be tested by filling with water to an elevation 5 feet above the top of pipe at the upstream end of the test section, or 5 feet above the existing ground water elevation, whichever is greater. The water should be introduced into the test section four hours in advance of the official test period to allow the pipe and joint material to become saturated. The pipe shall then be refilled to the original water level.  

At the beginning of the test, the elevation of the water in the upper manhole shall be carefully measured from a point on the manhole rim. After a period of 4 hours (or less, with the approval of the Director) the water elevation shall be measured from the same point on the manhole rim and the loss of water during the test period calculated. If this calculation is difficult, enough water shall be measured into the upper manhole to restore the water to the level existing at the beginning of the test, and the amount added taken as the total leakage.  

Should an initial test show excess leakage in a section of line, it is permissible to draw the water off and test the manholes that contained water. This test shall be made by plugging all the openings in the manholes and filling with water to the same elevation as existed during the test. The leakage from the manhole may be deducted from the total leakage of the test section in arriving at the test leakage. After the testing is complete, the manhole shall be waterproofed by grouting. Other approved water-proofing methods may be used if satisfactory to the Director.  

The allowable leakage in the test section shall not exceed 1.6 gallons per 100 feet, per 4 hour test, per inch diameter of pipe tested at the 5 foot test head.  

If it is necessary or desirable to increase the test head above 5 feet, the allowable leakage will be increased at the rate of 0.25 gallons for each foot of increase in head.  

Test sections showing leakage in excess of that allowed shall be repaired or reconstructed as necessary to reduce the leakage to that specified above. The line shall then be retested after a minimum period of 24 hours during which no additional water shall be introduced into the line.  

3. Force Mains - Each section of pipe to be tested shall be slowly filled with water and all air expelled from the pipe. After the pipe has been filled, it shall be allowed to set for a period of not less than 24 hours.  

The pipe shall then be refilled to the original water level and subjected to a pressure of not less than 100 pounds per square inch or the service pressure plus 50 pounds, whichever is greater, for a period of 2 hours. All exposed joints, bends, angles, and fittings shall be closely examined during the test any part of the line which proves to be defective shall be replaced and the line retested.  

The allowable leakage shall not exceed 0.32 gallons per 4 hour test per 100 feet of pipe per inch of nominal diameter.  

O. Cleaning - Prior to the acceptance of any sewer line by the City, the Contractor shall clean all lines with a Wayne-type sewer cleaning ball under hydrostatic pressure. Any stoppage, dirt or foreign matter shall be removed from the lines. All materials and debris removed shall be collected and vacuumed out of the system at a manhole selected by the Director and no debris shall be washed or otherwise deposited into the City's system. All cleaning and testing of sewer lines shall take place after all construction work is completed, up to but not including the final paving. The system will be inspected after final paving is completed and any damage to the system during final paving and cleanup shall be corrected before approval.  

P. Placement of Road Surfaces and Replacement - Paving replacement shall not proceed until the full requirements of Paragraphs 6.17A through 6.17N have been met to the satisfaction of the Director, but in no less than ten (10) days after backfill has been completed.  

1. The replacement of roadway structural section over all cuts in existing bituminous pavement shall be made in accordance with the standard drawing for backfill requirements for water or sewer lines.  

Alternate structural sections may be proposed for approval by the Director providing the design is performed by a licensed civil engineer and is done in accordance with good engineering practice.  

Until the permanent pavement is placed, the material at the surface of the trench shall be maintained at all times at a grade level with the street, suitable for the safe passage of traffic. When ready for repairing, the upper portion of the trench shall be excavated to a depth sufficient for installation of the required structural section. Aggregate base shall be placed, compacted and graded. Edges of the existing asphalt concrete shall be trimmed to provide a neat and straight vertical joint. The joint face shall then be cleaned and tacked with asphaltic emulsion. Type B asphalt concrete shall be placed in accordance with Section 39 of the Standard Specifications.  

2. Where portland cement pavement is removed, the compacted backfill shall be made to within 12 inches of the original surface and 6 inches of aggregate base added having a relative compaction of $95\%$ . The pavement shall be 6 inches of Class "B" concrete (containing five sacks of cement per cubic yard). The finished surface of the concrete shall be given a finish treatment with a wood float and then broomed to cause a slight groove in the surface at right angles to the direction of traffic. The pavement shall not be opened to traffic until seven days after the concrete was placed.  

3. Where the sewer trench follows the edge of pavement or is placed in an existing shoulder, the top 6 inches of the backfill shall consist of thoroughly compacted aggregate base.  

Shoulders having a greater depth of base material than 6 inches shall be replaced with a thickness at least equal to that removed, and the approval of the Director as to the exact type of replacement in such cases is required.  

The finished replacement shall be rolled and finished to make the best possible connection to the existing pavement or shoulder, and then liquid asphalt SC-250 shall be applied at the rate of one-half gallon per square yard.  

4. Any exceptions to the above shall be indicated on the plans, except that replacements of heavier pavements shall be of a thickness at least equal to that removed, with the approval of the Director.  

5. The replacement of all pavement and shoulder surfaces as designated above shall be in conformance with "Section 4 -- Roads and Streets" of these Standards and Specifications as to materials and methods of construction.  

Q. Temporary Pavement - In any case where a trench is cut across a main thoroughfare, or if noted on the drawings, or required by the Director a temporary asphalt plant-mix-cutback surface shall be placed immediately after backfill has been completed and removed just prior to placing the permanent surfacing material.  

R. Clean Up - During the progress of the work, the Contractor shall keep the entire job site in a clean and orderly condition. Excess or unsuitable backfill material, broken pipe, or other waste material shall be removed from the job site. Spillage resulting from hauling operations along or across existing streets or roads shall be removed immediately by the Contractor. All gutters and roadside ditches shall be kept clean and free from obstructions. Any deviation from this practice shall have prior approval from the Director.  

Before final acceptance of the work, the Contractor shall carefully clean up the work and premises, remove all temporary structures used in construction, remove all surplus construction materials and rubbish of all kinds from the grounds which have been occupied and leave them in a neat condition.  

# 7.01 WATER SUPPLY: GENERAL  

Water mains connecting existing publicly regulated water distribution systems shall be installed to serve each lot. Installation of water mains and all appurtenances thereto will be installed to grades, location, design and sizes approved by the Director. 7.02 QUANTITY OF WATER:  

The quantity of water delivered to the distribution system from all sources must be sufficient to supply adequately, dependably and safely the total requirements of all customers (including fire hydrants) under maximum consumption. Minimum fire flow for new residential development shall be 1000 gpm with 20 psi residual pressure, while at the same time delivering peak domestic flows. Minimum fire flow for commercial development shall be in accordance with the latest adopted Uniform Fire Code. The distribution system must be capable of adequately delivering this water supply to all the customers.  

# 7.03 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM:  

The distribution system, wherever possible, shall be in grid form so that pressures throughout the system tend to become equalized under varying rates and locations of drafts.  

A. Layout of Mains - In general, the minimum size pipe shall be not less than 6 inches inside diameter for a cul-de-sac and 8 inches inside diameter for grid lines.

In those streets classified for dual mains, the minimum size shall be 8 inches on each side. The distribution system shall be grid-ironed with 8 inch or larger cross-connecting mains, with intermediate lines as required. Larger mains shall be provided to serve multiple housing, commercial or industrial areas as determined by an engineering evaluation of the anticipated demand.  

B. The distribution system shall be equipped with a sufficient number of valves, so that no single shut down will result in shutting down a transmission main or necessitate the removal from service of a length of pipe greater than 500 feet.

D. Air and vacuum release valves shall be installed in the water system at all points where it is indicated that air pockets may form. The design shall be such as to insure the release of air automatically from the water main. These valves may also insure the entrance of air into the water main when the pressure inside the line is below atmospheric pressure. All valves shall be designed for a minimum of 150 PSI operating pressure. The inlet to each valve shall be provided with a gate valve or corporation stop to provide a positive closure between the main pipeline and the air and vacuum release valve, and the air and vacuum release vent outlet shall be installed above ground in such a manner as to preclude back-flow.  

E. Tracer Wire, No. 12 THWN-THHW, shall be placed in the trench with all non-metallic pipe.  

For mains, the wire shall be continuous between valve boxes and shall extend to the top of each valve box on the outside of the riser pipe. End of wire shall be looped, 6 inch minimum, over edge of riser pipe. Where there are no valve boxes and the water main extends to the surface, the tracer wire shall extend to 12 inches above the finished surface with the piping and be secured with stainless steel band to the pipe. In the case of a blow off, the wire shall be brought into the blowoff riser box and end in a coil, 12 inches minimum.  

For air-vac lines, the wire shall be tied to the wire installed with the main. The end in the valve box shall be coiled, 12 inches minimum, and ties to the valve.  

Wire shall be terminated as directed where the above is not applicable.

All valves shall have anchors as shown on the standard drawings.  

# 7.04 LAYING, TESTING AND DISINFECTING WATER MAIN:  

Each section of pipe and each fitting shall be thoroughly cleaned before it is installed. All pipe, fittings, valves, etc., shall be carefully lowered into the trench by suitable tools or equipment, in such manner as to prevent damage to the pipe, lining, coating, fitting, or other appurtenances. Under no circumstances shall pipe or accessories be dropped into the trench.  

The pipe shall be laid true to line, with no visible change in alignment at any joint, unless curved alignment is shown on the plans.  

When curved alignment is shown on the plans the maximum deflection at any joint shall not exceed the manufacturer's recommendation for the type of pipe and joint being used.  

Thrust blocks of Class B concrete shall be cast in place at all bends of $5^{\circ}$ or more, at the end of plugged mains, behind each tee or each cross and at the back of fire hydrants. The thrust block shall extend from the fitting to undisturbed soil, shall be kept clear of the joints, and shall be of such bearing areas as shown on the standard drawings. Line valves shall have Class B concrete anchors as shown on the standard drawings.  

Whenever pipe laying is discontinued for short periods, or when work is stopped at the end of the day, the open ends of all mains shall be closed with water-tight plugs or caps. The plug or cap shall not be removed unless or until the trench is dry.  

Valves shall be set plumb, supported on a concrete base and properly fitted to the adjacent sections of main. A valve box shall be installed over each valve. All valves adjacent to fittings shall be flanged to the fitting.  

The Contractor shall not depressurize existing water mains until authorized to do so by the Director. Prior to any depressurization of existing water mains, new water mains must be tested and flushed clean and all customer services shall be connected to the new water main. Temporary thrust blocks or connections to accomplish this shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.  

Where necessary for inserting valves or fittings, the pipe shall be neatly and squarely cut to length.  

Ductile Iron Pipe - Ductile iron pipe shall be handled, installed and tested in accordance with AWWA Standards C600-93, AWWA C105-93, and the standard drawings.  

Cleaning - Prior to filling, testing, and disinfecting the installed line, the Contractor shall ensure that the line is clean in conformance with ANSI/AWWA C651. To facilitate effective disinfection and minimize the chlorine dosage needed, when practicable, predisinfection flushing should continue until the discharge turbidity drops below 5 ntu using measurement procedures described in AWWA Manual M12.  

Filling and Flushing - Lines shall be filled slowly with potable water at a maximum velocity of 1 ft/s while venting all air. Precautions shall be taken to prevent entrapping air in the lines. After filling, lines shall be flushed at blowoffs and dead ends at a minimum velocity of 3 ft/s. A minimum of three changes of treated water shall be used in flushing operations. Valves shall be closed slowly to prevent excessive surges while maintaining positive pressure at all times throughout the new line. Flushing water shall be discharges without causing erosion damage, nuisance, or interruption of traffic. A special pipeline pig may be required when the required flushing velocity cannot be achieved or when needed to conserve water. The Contractor shall make provisions for launching and retrieving the pig.  

Hydrostatic Testing  

General - To prevent pipe movement sufficient backfill shall be placed prior to filling the pipe with water and field testing. When local conditions require that the trenches be backfilled immediately after the pipe has been laid, the testing may be carried out after backfilling has been completed but before placement of permanent surfacing. The constructor shall ensure that thrust blocking or other types of restraining systems will provide adequate restraint prior to pressurizing the pipeline.  

Cross-Connection Control - When existing water mains are used to supply test water, they should be protected from backflow contamination by temporarily installing a double check-valve assembly between the test and supply main or by other means approved by the Director. Prior to pressure and leakage testing, the temporary backflow protection should be removed and the main under test isolated from the supply main.  

Procedure - The following procedure is based on the assumption that the pressure and leakage tests will be performed at the same time. Separate tests may be made if desired. If separate tests are made, the pressure test shall be performed first. Tests shall be performed only after the pipeline has been properly filled, flushed, and purged of all air. The specified test pressure shall be applied by means of an approved pumping assembly connected to the pipe in a manner satisfactory to the Director. The test pressure shall not exceed pipe or thrust-restraint design pressures. If necessary, the test pressure shall be maintained by additional pumping for the specified time during which the system and all exposed pipe, fittings, valves, and hydrants shall be carefully examined for leakage. All visible leaks shall be stopped. All defective elements shall be repaired or removed and replaced and the test repeated until the allowable leakage requirements have been met.  

Test Method - The Contractor may perform simultaneous pressure and leakage tests or perform separate pressure and leakage tests on the installed system at test durations and pressures specified in Table 1. Tests shall be witnessed by the Director or the Director's agent, and the equipment used for the test shall be subject to the approval of the Director or the Director's agent.  

Allowable Leakage - The Contractor shall furnish the gauges and measuring device for the leakage test, pump, pipe, connections, and all other necessary apparatus, unless otherwise specified, and shall furnish the necessary assistance to conduct the test. The duration of each leakage test shall be 2 hours, unless otherwise specified. During the test, the pipeline shall be subjected to the pressure listed in Table 1.  

Leakage shall be defined as the quantity of water that must be supplied into the pipe section being tested to maintain a pressure within 5 psi of the specified leakage-test pressure after the pipe has been filled with water and the air in the pipeline has been expelled. No installation will be accepted if the leakage is greater than that determined by the formula:  

Where:  

${\mathsf{L}}=$ allowable leakage, in gallons per hour   
${\sf N}=$ number of joints in the length of pipeline tested   
$\mathsf{D}=$ nominal diameter of the pipe, in inches   
${\sf P}=$ average test pressure during the leakage test, in pounds per square inch (gauge)

These formulas are based on an allowable leakage of 10.5 gpd/mi/in. of nominal diameter at a pressure of 150 psi.  

Leakage values determined by the above formulas are presented in Table 2.  

All visible leaks shall be repaired, regardless of the amount of leakage.  

Alternative allowable-leakage criteria may be used if specified by the Director.  

Disinfecting - Prior to placing the installed water line in service, the new pipe and all exposed sections and appurtenances of existing pipelines shall be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with ANSI/AWWA C651, unless otherwise specified. Pipelines shall be flushed following completion of disinfection procedures. Disposal or neutralization of disinfection water shall comply with applicable regulations. (Refer to Appendix B of ANSI/AWWA C651.)  

Basic Disinfection Procedure  

The basic disinfection procedure consists of:  

1. Preventing contaminating materials from entering the water main during storage, construction, or repair.  

2. Removing, by flushing or other means, those materials that may have entered the water main. 3. Chlorinating any residual contamination that may remain, and flushing the chlorinated water from the main. 4. Protecting the existing distribution system from backflow due to hydrostatic pressure test and disinfection procedures. 5. Determining the bacteriological quality by laboratory test after disinfection. 6. Final connection of the approved new water main to the active distribution system.  

Preventive and Corrective Measures During Construction  

Heavy particulates generally contain bacteria and prevent even very high chlorine concentrations from contacting and killing such organisms. It is, therefore, essential that the procedures of this section be observed to assure that a water main and its appurtenances are thoroughly clean for the final disinfection by chlorination. Also, any connection of new water main to the active distribution system prior to receipt of satisfactory bacteriological samples may constitute a cross-connection. Therefore, the new main must be isolated until bacteriological tests described in this standard are satisfactorily completed.  

Keeping Pipe Clean and Dry - Precautions shall be taken to protect the interiors of pipes, fittings, and valves against contamination. Pipe delivered for construction shall be strung so as to minimize the entrance of foreign material. All openings in the pipeline shall be closed with watertight plugs when pipe laying is stopped at the close of the day's work or for other reasons, such as rest breaks or meal periods. Rodent-proof plugs may be used when it is determined that watertight plugs are not practicable and when thorough cleaning will be performed by flushing or other means.  

Delay in placement of delivered pipe invites contamination. The more closely the rate of delivery is correlated to the rate of pipe laying, the lower the risk of contamination.  

Joints - Joints of all pipe in the trench shall be completed before work is stopped. If water accumulates in the trench, the plugs shall remain in the place until the trench is dry.  

Cleaning and Swabbing - If dirt enters the pipe, it shall be removed and the interior pipe surface swabbed with a $1\%$ hypochlorite disinfecting solution. If, in the opinion of the Director, the dirt remaining in the pipe will not be removed by the flushing operation, then the interior of the pipe shall be cleaned by mechanical means such as a hydraulically propelled foam pig (or other suitable device acceptable to the Director) in conjunction with the application of a $1\%$ hypochlorite disinfecting solution to the interior pipe surface. The cleaning method used shall not force mud or debris into the interior pipe-joint spaces and shall be acceptable to the Director.  

Wet-Trench Construction - If it is not possible to keep the pipe and fittings dry during installation, every effort shall be made to ensure that any of the water that may enter the pipe-joint spaces contains an available chlorine concentration of approximately $25~\mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{L}$ . This may be accomplished by adding calcium hypochlorite granules or tablets to each length of pipe before it is lowered into a wet trench, or by treating the trench water with hypochlorite tablets.  

Flooding by Storm or Accident During Construction - If the main is flooded during construction, it shall be cleared of the floodwater by draining and flushing with potable water until the main is clean. The section exposed to the floodwater shall then be filled with a chlorinated potable water that, at the end of a 24 hour holding period, will have a free chlorine residual of not less than $25~\mathrm{mg/L}$ . The chlorinated water may then be drained or flushed from the main. After construction is completed, the main shall be disinfected using the continuous-feed or slug method.  

Backflow Protection - The new water main shall be kept isolated from the active distribution system until satisfactory bacteriological testing has been completed and the disinfectant water flushed out.  

Methods of Chlorination  

Three methods of chlorination are explained in this section: tablet, continuous feed, and slug. The tablet method gives an average chlorine dose of approximately 25 mg/L; the continuous-feed method gives a 24 hour chlorine residual of not less than 10 mg/L; and the slug method gives a 3 hour exposure of not less than $50~\mathrm{mg/L}$ free chlorine.  

TABLE 3 Ounces of calcium hypochlorite granules to be placed at beginning of main and at each 500-ft interval  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Calcium Hypochlorite</td></tr><tr><td>Pipe Diameter</td><td>Granules</td></tr><tr><td>in.</td><td>oZ.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>16 or larger</td><td>8.0</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Tablet Method - The tablet method consists of placing calcium hypochlorite granules or tablet in the water main as it is being installed and then filling the main with potable water when installation is completed.  

This method may be used only if the pipes and appurtenances are kept clean and dry during construction.  

Placing of calcium hypochlorite granules. During construction, calcium hypochlorite granules shall be placed at the upstream end of the first section of pipe, at the upstream end of each branch main, and at 500 foot intervals. The quantity of granules shall be as shown in Table 3.  

WARNING: This procedure must not be used on solvent-welded plastic or on screwed-joint steel pipe because of the danger of fire or explosion from the reaction of the joint compounds with the calcium hypochlorite.  

Placing of calcium hypochlorite tablets. During construction 5-g calcium hypochlorite tablets shall be placed in each section of pipe. Also, one such tablet shall be placed in each hydrant, hydrant branch, and other appurtenance. Table 4 shows the number of tablets required for commonly used sizes of pipe. The tablets shall be attached by a food-grade adhesive. Examples of food-grade adhesives are Permatex Form-A-Gasket No. 2 and Permatex Clear RTV Silicone Adhesive Sealant, which are manufactured by Loctite Corporation, Kansas City, KS 66115. These products have both been approved by the US Drug Administration (USDA) for uses that may involve contact with edible products. Permatex Form-A-Gasket No. 1, has not received FDA approval. There shall be no adhesive on the tablet except on the broadside attached to the surface of the pipe. Attach all the tablets inside and at the top of the main, with approximately equal numbers of tablets at each end of a given pipe length. If the tablets are attached before the pipe section is placed in the trench, their position shall be marked on the section so it can be readily determined that the pipe is installed with the tablets at the top.  

Filling and contact. When installation has been completed, the main shall be filled with water at a rate such that water within the main will flow at a velocity no greater than 1 ft/s. Precautions shall be taken to ensure that air pockets are eliminated. This water shall remain in the pipe for at least 24 hours. If the water temperature is less than $41^{\circ}F$ , the water shall remain in the pipe for at least 48 hours. As an optional procedure (if specified by the Director), water used to fill the new main shall be supplied through a temporary connection that shall include an appropriate cross-connection control device, consistent with the degree of hazard, for backflow protection of the active distribution system.  

Continuous-Feed Method - The continuous-feed method consists of placing calcium hypochlorite granules in the main during construction (optional), completely filling the main to remove all air pockets, flushing the completed main to remove particulates, and filling the main with potable water. The potable water shall be chlorinated so that after a 24 hour holding period in the main there will be a free chlorine residual of not less than $10\mathrm{mg/L}$ .

\* Based on $3.25\cdot g$ available chlorine per tablet; any portion of tablet rounded to next higher integer.  

Placing of calcium hypochlorite granules. At the option of the Director, calcium hypochlorite granules shall be placed in pipe sections as specified in the tablet method.  

The purpose of this procedure is to provide a strong chlorine concentration in the first flow of flushing water that flows down the main. In particular, this procedure is recommended when the type of pipe is such that this first flow of water will flow into annular spaces at pipe joints.  

Preliminary flushing. Before being chlorinated, the main shall be filled to eliminate air pockets and shall be flushed to remove particulates. The flushing velocity in the main shall not be less than 2.5 ft/s. Table 5 shows the rates of flow required to produce a velocity of 2.5 ft/s in commonly used sizes of pipe. Note that flushing is no substitute for preventive measures during construction. Certain contaminants, such as caked deposits, resist flushing at any feasible velocity.

Procedure for chlorinating the main  

1. Water supplied from a temporary, backflow-protected connection to the existing distribution system or other approved source of supply shall be made to flow at a constant, measured rate into the newly installed water main. In the absence of a meter, the rate may be approximated by methods such as placing a Pitot gauge in the discharge, or measuring the time to fill a container of known volume.  

2. At a point not more than 10 feet downstream from the beginning of the new main, water entering the new main shall receive a dose of chlorine fed at a constant rate such that the water will have not less than $25~\mathrm{mg/L}$ free chlorine. To ensure that this concentration is provided, measure the chlorine concentration at regular intervals in accordance with the procedures described in the current edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater or AWWA Manual M12, or using appropriate chlorine test kits.  

Table 6 gives the amount of chlorine required for each 100 feet of pipe of various diameters. Solutions of $1\%$ chlorine may be prepared with sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite. The latter solution requires 1 lb of calcium hypochlorite in 8 gal of water.

3. As an optional procedure (if specified by the Director), water used to fill the new main during the application of chlorine shall be supplied through a temporary connection. This temporary connection shall be installed with an appropriate crossconnection control device, consistent with the degree of hazard, for backflow protection of the active distribution system. Chlorine application shall not cease until the entire main is filled with heavily chlorinated water. The chlorinated water shall be retained in the main for at least 24 hours, during which time all valves and hydrants in the treated section shall be operated to ensure disinfection of the appurtenances. At the end of this 24 hour period, the treated water in all portions of the main shall have a residual of not less than $10\mathrm{mg/L}$ free chlorine.  

4. Direct-feed chlorinators, which operate solely from gas pressure in the chlorine cylinder, shall not be used for the application of liquid chlorine. (The danger of using direct-feed chlorinators is that water pressure in the main can exceed gas pressure in the chlorine cylinder. This allows a backflow of water into the cylinder, resulting in severe cylinder corrosion and escape of chlorine gas.) The preferred equipment for applying liquid chlorine is a solution-feed, vacuum-operated chlorinator and a booster pump. The vacuum-operated chlorinator mixes the chlorine gas in solution water; the booster pump injects the chlorine-gas solution into the main to be disinfected. Hypochlorite solutions may be applied to the water main with a gasoline or electrically powered chemical-feed pump designed for feeding chlorine solutions. Feed lines shall be of such material and strength as to safely withstand the corrosion caused by the concentrated chlorine solutions and the maximum pressures that may be created by the pumps. All connections shall be checked for tightness before the solution is applied to the main.  

Slug Method - The slug method consists of placing calcium hypochlorite granules in the main during construction, completely filling the main to eliminate all air pockets, flushing the main to remove particulates, and slowly flowing through the main a slug of water dosed with chlorine to a concentration of $100~\mathrm{{mg/L}}$ . The slow rate of flow ensures that all parts of the main and its appurtenances will be exposed to the highly chlorinated water for a period of not less than 3 hours.  

At a point not more than 10 feet downstream from the beginning of the new main, water entering the new main shall receive a dose of chlorine fed at a constant rate such that the water will have not less than $100\ m g/L$ free chlorine. To ensure that this concentration is achieved, the chlorine concentration must be measured at regular intervals. The chlorine shall be applied continuously and for a sufficient period to develop a solid column, or "slug", of chlorinated water that will, as it moves through the main, expose all interior surfaces to a concentration of approximately $100~\mathsf{m g/L}$ for at least 3 hours.  

The free chlorine residual shall be measured in the slug as it moves through the main. If at any time it drops below $50~\mathrm{mg/L}$ , the flow shall be stopped, chlorination equipment shall be relocated at the head of the slug, and, as flow is resumed, chlorine shall be applied to restore the free chlorine in the slug to not less than $100~\mathrm{{mg/L}}$ .  

As chlorinated water flows past fittings and valves, related valves and hydrants shall be operated so as to disinfect appurtenances and pipe branches.  

Final Flushing  

Clearing the Main of Heavily Chlorinated Water - After the applicable retention period, heavily chlorinated water should not remain in prolonged contact with pipe. In order to prevent damage to the pipe lining or corrosion damage to the pipe itself, the heavily chlorinated water shall be flushed from the main until chlorine measurements show that the concentration in the water leaving the main in no higher than that generally prevailing in the distribution system or is acceptable for domestic use.  

Disposing of Heavily Chlorinated Water - The environment into which the chlorinated water is to be discharged shall be inspected. If there is any possibility that the chlorinated discharge will cause damage to the environment, then a neutralizing chemical shall be applied to the water to be wasted to neutralize thoroughly the chlorine residual remaining in the water. Where necessary, federal, state, provincial, and local regulatory agencies should be contacted to determine special provisions for the disposal of heavily chlorinated water.  

# Bacteriological Tests  

Standard Conditions - After final flushing and before the new water main is connected to the distribution system, at least one acceptable sample shall be collected by the Contractor from the new main. At least one sample shall be collected from every 1200 feet of the new water main, plus one from the end of the line and at least one from each branch. All samples shall be tested for bacteriological quality in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, utilizing the multiple tube fermentation test and shall show the absence of coliform organisms. A standard heterotrophic plate count or membrane filter test for pseudomonas may be required at the option of the Director. The cost of all bacteriological testing shall be borne by the Contractor.  

Special Conditions - If trench water has entered the new main during construction or, if in the opinion of the Director, excessive quantities of dirt or debris have entered the new main, bacteriological samples shall be taken at intervals of approximately 200 feet and shall be identified by location. Samples shall be taken of water that has stood in the new main for at least 16 hours after final flushing has been completed.  

Sampling Procedure - Samples for bacteriological analysis shall be collected in sterile bottles treated with sodium thiosulfate as required by Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. No hose or fire hydrant shall be used in the collection of samples. A corporation cock may be installed in the main with a coppertube gooseneck assembly. After samples have been collected, the gooseneck assembly may be removed and retained for future use.  

# Redisinfection  

If the initial disinfection fails to produce satisfactory bacteriological results, the new main may be reflushed and shall be resampled. If check samples also fail to produce acceptable results, the main shall be rechlorinated by the continuous-feed or slug method of chlorination until satisfactory results are obtained.  

NOTE: High velocities in the existing system, resulting from flushing the new main, may disturb sediment that has accumulated in the existing mains. When check samples are taken, it is advisable to sample water entering the new main.  

Final Connections to Existing Mains  

Water mains and appurtenances must be completely installed, flushed, disinfected, and satisfactory bacteriological sample results received prior to connection to the active distribution system.  

Disinfection Procedures When Cutting Into or Repairing Existing Mains  

The following procedures apply primarily when existing mains are wholly or partially dewatered. After the appropriate procedures have been completed, the existing main may be returned to service prior to completion of bacteriological testing in order to minimize the time customers are out of water. Leaks or breaks that are repaired with clamping devices while the mains remain full of pressurized water present little danger of contamination and require no disinfection.  

Trench Treatment - When an existing main is opened, either by accident or by design, the excavation will likely be wet and may be badly contaminated from nearby sewers. Liberal quantities of hypochlorite applied to open trench areas will lessen the danger from such pollution. Tablets have the advantage in such a situation because they dissolve slowly and continue to release hypochlorite as water is pumped from the excavation.  

Swabbing With Hypochlorite Solution - The interior of all pipe and fittings (particularly couplings and sleeves) used in making the repair or connection shall be swabbed or sprayed with a $1\%$ hypochlorite solution before they are installed.  

Flushing - Thorough flushing is the most practical means of removing contamination introduced during repairs or connections. If valve and hydrant locations permit, flushing toward the work location from both directions is recommended. Flushing shall be started as soon as the repairs are completed and shall be continued until discolored water is eliminated.  

Slug Chlorination - When practical, in addition to the procedures above, the section of main in which the break or connection is located shall be isolated, all service connections shut off, and the section flushed and chlorinated as specified herein except that the dose may be increased to as much as ${300}~\mathrm{mg/L}$ and the contact time reduced to as little as 15 min. After chlorination, flushing shall be resumed and continued until discolored water is eliminated, and the water is free of noticeable chlorine odor.  

Sampling - Bacteriological samples shall be taken after repairs are completed to provide a record for determining the procedure's effectiveness. If the direction of flow is unknown, then samples shall be taken on each side of the main break. If positive bacteriological samples are recorded, then the situation shall be evaluated by the Director who can determine corrective action, and daily sampling shall be continued until two consecutive negative samples are recorded.
