# LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 8  

BC Tree Fruits Cooperative (the "Employer") -andUnited Food and Commercial Workers International Union, Local 247 (the "Union")  

July 13, 2018  

In order to stay competitive in the labour market, to keep up with production in the most efficient way possible, and to encourage internal posting opportunities, the Employer and Union have entered into this letter of understanding.  

# SCHEDULE AAAA - Creation, Names, and Wage Adjustments  

As per Article 16 - Job Vacancies, sub Article 16.01 - Job Classifications, the employer will be adding to the Cidery operations a separate seniority list named SCHEDULE "AAAA" Classifications. All rights of seniority, posting practices, and interlist movement will be commensurate with current established practices and the collective agreement.  

Schedule "AAAA" classifications are as follows:  

Job Class 1 Cellar Operator Leadhand \$19.00   
Job Class 2 Cellar Supply Leadhand \$18.25   
Job Class 3 Cellar Machine Operator \$18.00   
Job Class 4 Cellar Supply Hand \$17.25   
Job Class 5 Cidery Line Worker \$15.00   
(formerly known as Cellar Hand)  

Cellar Machine Operator Leadhand and Cellar Supply Leadhand are two new positions that the Cidery has added to the seniority list. The job descriptions for Job Class 1, 2 and 3 have all been attached to this letter of understanding so it is clear as to what the position entails.  

# SCHEDULE AAAA - SUPERVISION  

The parties agree the Cidery Leadhands (persons) will be hired as unionized employees working and supervising alongside other Union employees and it is acknowledged that their primary function will be to supervise the Schedule "AAAA" classifications. The introduction of these additional positions shall not result in a reduction of hours or be used to prevent overtime in the department as specified in Schedule "AAAA".  

In accordance with our current practice, the Cellar Foreman and Cellar Foreman/Assistant will work as management staff answering to the Senior Cellar Foreman. This position will work side by side with Union employees performing the same work within the Schedule AAAA classification and their responsibilities will include the supervision of union employees.  

# RECLASSIFICATION TO PREVIOUS JOB CLASS  

Cidery Employees wishing to give up their posted position shall give the Employer and the Union four (4) weeks advance notice of such intent in writing. In cases where there is a mutual agreement between the Cidery employee and Employer the notice may be less.  If the Cidery employee wishes to step down for medical reason (proof provided), the notice period may be less than four (4) weeks. The vacancy thus created shall be posted and upon successful awarding of said posting (training, if required) the Employer shall slot the affected Cidery employee into their previously posted position.  

However, if a Cidery employee chooses to avail themselves of this provision they shall not be eligible to post to the same position for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of transfer.  

All changes will be effective August 7, 2018 unless otherwise stated above.  This letter will expire at the end of the current contract.
