    "Page_9": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\nOur Market Opportunity\nThe wealth management industry has experienced significant growth in terms of assets invested by retail investors in the past several years.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household and non-profit organization financial assets totaled $45.7 trillion as of September 30, 2010, up\nfrom $44.3 trillion in 2009 and $33.3 trillion in 2003. According to Cerulli Associates, an industry research firm, as of December 31, 2009, $9.5\ntrillion of assets were professionally managed for retail investors compared to $6.8 trillion as of December 31, 2003. In addition, according to\nCerulli Associates, in 2009, there were approximately 334,000 financial advisors registered with FINRA or the SEC that were focused on retail\ninvestors.\nIn addition to experiencing significant growth in financial assets, the wealth management industry is characterized by a number of important\n trends, including those described below, which we believe create a significant market opportunity for technology-enabled investment solutions\nand services like ours.\nIncreased prevalence of independent financial advisors. Based on industry news reports, we believe that over the past several years an\nincreasing percentage of financial advisors have elected to leave large financial institutions and start their own financial advisory practices or\nmove to smaller, more independent firms. In 2010, according to the Investment News database called Advisors on the Move, $79 billion in\nassets shifted advisory channels. The independent channel was the only channel to realize asset gains (approximately $16 billion). Wirehouses,\nregional broker-dealers, insurance and bank broker-dealers all experience net asset outflows.\nSEC registrations, and dually registered financial advisors. We believe, based on our industry experience, that this trend was accelerated in the\npast two to three years as a result of the reputational harm suffered by several of the largest financial institutions during the recent financial\ncrisis. In particular, according to Cerulli Associates, an estimated 40% of financial advisors were considered independent in 2009, and 47% of\nfinancial advisors will be independent by the end of 2014, implying that the percentage of financial advisors employed by large financial\ninstitutions (wirehouse, regional, insurance and bank) will shrink from 60% in 2009 to 53% in 2014.\nMoreover, according to projections by Cerulli Associates, the percentage of assets invested by retail clients with independent financial advisors\nis expected to rise from 30% in 2007 to 37% in 2012, while the wirehouse market share will shrink from 48% in 2007 to 33% in 2012.\nIncreased reliance on technology among independent financial advisors. In order to compete effectively in the marketplace, independent \nfinancial advisors are increasingly relying on technology service providers to help them provide comparable services cost effectively and\nefficiently, according to Cerulli Associates. In addition, IBDs and RIA firms have been incented to enhance the sophistication of their\ntechnology platforms in order to attract financial advisors from larger financial institutions, according to Cerulli Associates. In addition, we\nbelieve, based on a report from Cerulli Associates, that financial advisors generally favor technology solutions that enable them to spend more\ntime on asset allocation, fund and manager selection and client interaction, rather than on administrative or technology-related activities. Based\non a report from Cerulli Associates, we believe that advanced technological support is a key driver for growth in an independent financial\nadvisor s business. For example, an advanced technology platform with fully integrated tools helps reduce the need for the manual processing of\ndata and the use of multiple incompatible technology applications, allowing financial advisors to spend more time interacting with their clients,\nwhile also potentially allowing the financial advisor to reduce technology-related costs.\nIncreased use of financial advisors. We believe, based on an analysis done by Cerulli Associates, that the recent significant volatility and\nincreasing complexity in securities markets have resulted in increased investor interest in receiving professional financial advisory services.\nconfidence ratings for advisors, investors are increasingly implementing additional advisory relationships as a method to test drive\n7",
    "Page_10": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\nadvisors in order to compare performance and service. Independent financial advisors are well positioned to attract clients interested in managed\naccount solutions over the next three years. According to Cerulli Associates, from December 31, 2002 to June 30, 2010, retail managed account \nAssociates, financial advisors that serve as portfolio managers have had their assets under management grow at a compound annual growth rate\nof 25% from $62 billion in 2002 to $351 billion as of June 30, 2010.\nIncreased use of fee-based investment solutions. Retail investor assets in managed accounts exceeded $2 trillion in September 2010. Based on\nour industry experience, we believe that in order for financial advisors to effectively manage their clients  assets, we believe they are utilizing\naccount types that offer the flexibility to choose among the widest range of investment solutions. Financial advisors typically charge their clients\nfees for these types of flexible accounts based on a percentage of assets rather than on a commission or other basis. According to Cerulli\ninformation provided by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, revenues from asset management fees (fee based revenue)\nincreased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 11% from 1990 to 2010, while revenues based on commissions increased at a\ncompound annual growth rate of approximately 5% during the same period. Based on these trends, we believe that financial advisors will\nneeds.\nMore stringent standards applicable to financial advisors. In light of the economic crisis and related securities market volatility in 2008 and\n2009, we believe that there will be increased attention on investor consumer protection, whether as a result of regulatory changes, voluntary\nindustry initiatives or competitive dynamics. Increased scrutiny of financial advisors to ensure compliance with current laws, coupled with the\npossibility of new laws focused on a fiduciary standard, may require changes to the way financial advisors offer advice. In order to adapt to these\nchanges, we believe that financial advisors willbenefit from utilizing a technology platform, such as ours, that allows them to address their\nclients wealth management needs, manage and memorialize decisions made throughout the process, and that assists them with recordkeeping\n and account monitoring.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe intend to increase our revenue and profitability by continuing to pursue the following strategies:\nsales and client service teams, we intend to continue the process of leveraging our existing enterprise client relationships to add\nnew financial advisors to our technology platform. Generally, when we establish an enterprise client relationship, we are provided\naccess to the client s financial advisors and given the opportunity to move them to our technology platform. During the past five\nyears, the number of financial advisors using our technology platform from existing enterprise clients has grown at a compound\nannual growth rate of 10%. Despite that growth, we have the opportunity to continue increasing the number of financial advisors\nwe serve within our existing enterprise client relationships.\nExtend the account base within a given advisor relationship. As our working relationships with our financial advisor customers\n develop over time, and through our sales and marketing efforts, we will seek to move more of their clients  assets onto our\nadvisor on our technology platform has grown from approximately 11 to 22, an increase of 100%. As a result, total AUM or AUA\naccounts have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 45% from December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2010.\nExpand the services we provide each advisor. In many cases, when we first enter into a client relationship with a financial\nplatform. Accordingly, through our sales and\n10",
    "Page_11": "EdgarFiling:ENVESTNET,INC.-Form10-K\nmarketing efforts, we will continue to educate our financial advisor customers regarding our company in order to expand the\nscope of our investment solutions and services they employ.\nObtain new enterprise clients. New enterprise clients provide us with access to a large number of financial advisors that may be\ninterested in utilizing our technology platform, as well as to the assets under management or administration that are managed by\nthese financial advisors. In most cases, a new enterprise client will provide us with the opportunity to attract a large number of\nfinancial advisors to our technology platform over time. In other cases, new enterprise clients elect to convert all or a significant \nour platform at the time of the asset conversion. We believe that the current market opportunity for enterprise conversions is\nsignificant, particularly compared to recent historical levels. New enterprise clients also provide further opportunities to execute\non the other strategies discussed above.\nContinue to invest in our technology platform. To continue to attract and retain enterprise clients and financial advisors, and to\ndeepen our relationships with them, we intend to continue to invest in our technology platform to provide financial advisors with\naccess to investment solutions and services that address the widest range of the financial advisors  front-, middle- and back-office\nneeds. In the years ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, we had technology development\nexpenditures totaling $4.9 million, $4.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively. We expect that we will have similar levels of\ntechnology development expenses in 2011. We will continue to invest to develop our technology platform to provide access to\ninvestment solutions and services from a wide range of leading third-party providers, while also continuing to enhance the\ninvestment solutions and services we offer through PMC.\nContinue to pursue transactions and other relationships. Though we have no transactions planned currently, we intend to\n continue to selectively pursue acquisitions, investments and other relationships that we believe can significantly enhance the\n attractiveness of our technology platform or expand our client base. We characterize these acquisitions, investments and other\nrelationships as either strategic or consolidating transactions. We pursue strategic transactions in order to add new functionality to\noperations. We believe we have been successful historically in identifying and executing transactions that have complemented our\nbusiness and allowed us to compete more effectively in our industry. Given our scale of operations and record of past transactions,\nwe believe we are well positioned to engage in such transactions in the future.\nOur Business Model\nWe believe that a number of attractive characteristics significantly contribute to the success of our business model, including:\nin the number of advisors and accounts and to provide the flexibility to add new investment solutions and services, our technology\nassets grow and with low marginal costs required to add additional accounts and new investment solutions and services.\nFurthermore, once we have contracted with a financial advisor and transitioned the associated assets to our technology platform,\nwe are able to add additional assets to our technology platform with minimal incremental costs. This enables us to generate\nsubstantial operating leverage during the course of our relationship with a financial advisor as the assets of the advisor s clients\ngrow, through the addition of advisors utilizing our technology platform and through the financial advisors  use of additional\ninvestment solutions and services.\n9\n11",

The substantial majority of our revenues is recurring and is derived either from asset-based\nfees, which are billed at the beginning of each quarter and from fixed fees under multi-year license agreements. For the year ended\n December 31, 2010, we derived 77% and 23% of our total revenues from asset-based fees and from licensing and professional\nservices revenues, respectively.\nStrong customer retention. We believe that the breadth of access to investment solutions and the multitude of services that we\nprovide allow financial advisors to address a wide range of their clients  needs and, as a result, financial advisors are less likely to\nmove away from our technology platform. Because a technology platform is involved in nearly all of a financial advisor s\nactivities needed to serve their clients, once a financial advisor has moved clients and their assets onto our technology platform,\nsignificant time, costs and/or resources would be required for the financial advisor to shift to another technology platform.\nFavorable industry trends.

These include breakpoint\npricing, where lower fee rates are applied as asset levels meet or exceed pre-established thresholds, fees based on aggregated client funds across\nseveral accounts held by family members, fees tailored to different investment programs and investment solution types and other customized fee\n and billing arrangements. Account administration includes account set-up, asset manager set-up, account funding and back-office administration.\nCompliance and Fiduciary Notes. Envestnet has created industry leading technology to help advisors and home offices track and maintain their\n own proprietary fiduciary process. Our technology platform includes configurable Fiduciary Oversight Notes (FONs) that help advisors\nunderstand implications of the decisions they make via educational text boxes, and then memorialize those decisions for client service and\nreporting. The FONs may be searched and reviewed by home offices or the advisors themselves.\nCommunication and Education. Based on our discussions with financial advisors, we believe that for financial advisors who operate within\nlarge financial institutions, the ability to communicate quickly and effectively with supervisors or firm management is important. Our\ntechnology platform provides supervisors or firm management with the ability to distribute to financial advisors notifications and\nannouncements regarding changes to manager portfolios, platform maintenance, account activity and other related information. Resources are\nalso available to assist financial advisors with practice management and education.\n13\n15",

We provide enterprise clients with a customized, private-labeled technology platform that enables them to support their\naffiliated financial advisors with a broad range of investment solutions and services. Our contracts with enterprise clients establish the applicable\nterms and conditions, including pricing terms, service level agreements and basic platform configurations. For the years ended December 31,\n 2008, 2009 and 2010, revenues associated with our relationship with our single largest enterprise client, FMR LLC, an affiliate of FMR Corp., or\nFidelity, accounted for 27%, 31% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenues. Though a loss of this client could have a material adverse effect\non our results of operations, financial condition and business, in such event, we would evaluate the need to reduce costs and take other steps to\nexpenses, including a reduction of our workforce. In the event that we were to lose Fidelity as a customer, though we would continue our\nongoing efforts to attract new customers, we can provide no assurances that we would be successful in obtaining new customers that would\nreplace all or any part of the revenues represented by our relationship with Fidelity. No other client accounted for more than 10% of our total\nrevenues.

The Enterprise Sales team, made up of 11 employees, focuses on entering into\nagreements with enterprise clients. The Advisory Sales team has 8 regions, 27 employees and is focused on selling to the individual financial\nadvisors of IBDs and entering into agreements with RIA firms pursuant to which the financial advisors agree to convert some or all of their\nclients onto our technology platform. Our third sales and marketing team has 8 employees from our PMC group. This team is focused on\nassisting financial advisors with constructing client porfolios and provides information regarding PMC s proprietary investment solutions and\nproducts.\nThe principal aim of our marketing efforts is to create greater visibility of our company and provide thought leadership to the wealth\nmanagement industry. Our marketing efforts are focused on our core markets: financial advisors and enterprise clients. We use advertising and\npublic relations to communicate our message to these target markets. Examples of these marketing efforts include:\nquotes in wealth management industry publications regarding our views on financial advisor trends and challenges;\nadvertising and other marketing materials promoting our investment solutions and services;\npresentations and speaking on panels;\n providing insights on industry trends through internal research and sponsoring and writing industry white papers; and\ncreating marketing tools for financial advisors to better communicate with their current and prospective clients\nTo implement our marketing efforts, we generally employ paid print and online advertisements in a variety of industry publications, as well as\npromotions that include e-blast campaigns and sponsored webinars.

We also use encryption techniques for data\ntransmissions. We control and limit access to confidential and proprietary information on a  need to know  basis.\nRegulation\nOverview\nThe financial services industry is among the most extensively regulated industries in the United States. We operate investment advisory,\nbroker-dealer and mutual fund businesses, each of which is subject to a specific regulatory scheme, including regulation at the Federal and state\nlevel, as well as regulation by self-regulatory organizations and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to numerous laws\nand regulations of general application.\nOur wholly-owned subsidiaries, Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., Portfolio Management Consultants, Inc. and Oberon Financial Technology,\nInc. operate investment advisory businesses. These subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as  investment advisers under the Advisers Act, and\nare regulated thereunder. As described further below, many of our investment advisory programs are conducted pursuant to the non-exclusive\nsafe harbor from the definition of an  investment company  provided for under Rule 3a-4 under the Investment Company Act. If Rule 3a-4 were to\ncease to be available, or if the SEC were to modify the rule or its interpretation of how the rule is applied, it could have a substantial effect on\nour business. Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. serves as the investment adviser to four mutual funds. Mutual funds are registered as\ninvestment companies under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, together with related\nregulations and interpretations of the SEC, impose numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including\nrecordkeeping requirements, limitations on advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities, and detailed\noperating requirements, including restrictions on transactions between an adviser and its clients, and between a mutual fund and its advisers and\naffiliates. The fiduciary obligations of investment advisers to their clients require advisers to, among other things, consider the suitability of the\ninvestment products and advice they provide, seek  best execution  for their clients  securities transactions, conduct due diligence on third-party\nproducts offered to clients, consider the appropriateness of the adviser s fees, and provide extensive and ongoing disclosure to clients. The\napplication of these requirements to wrap fee programs is particularly complex and the SEC has in the past scrutinized firms  compliance with\n these requirements. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose fines and sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the\nInvestment Company Act and has the power to restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to\nAdvisers Act and the Investment Company Act and the rules and interpretations promulgated thereunder, our failure to comply with such laws,\nrules and interpretations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nPortfolio Brokerage Services, Inc., or PBS, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC under the Securities\n Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, PBS is a member of FINRA, the securities\nindustry self-regulatory organization that supervises and regulates the conduct and activities of broker-dealers. Broker-dealers are subject to\nregulations that cover all aspects of their business, including sales practices, market making and trading among broker-dealers, use and\nsafekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct\n17\n20",

FINRA and the SEC conduct periodic examinations of the operations of\nits members, including PBS. Violation of applicable regulations can result in the suspension or revocation of a broker-dealer s registration, the\nimposition of censures or fines and the suspension or expulsion of the broker-dealer from FINRA. PBS is subject to minimum net capital\nrequirements under the Exchange Act, SEC and FINRA rules and conducts its business pursuant to the exemption from the SEC s customer\nprotection rule provided by Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2010, PBS was required to maintain a minimum\nof $100,000 in net capital and its actual net capital was $714,000.\nOur regulated subsidiaries are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that grant supervisory agencies, including the SEC, broad\nadministrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with these laws and regulations, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include\nthe suspension of individual employees, limitations on the permissibility of our regulated subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries to engage in\nbusiness for specified periods of time, censures, fines, and the revocation of registration as a broker-dealer or investment adviser, as applicable.\nAdditionally, the securities laws applicable to us and our subsidiaries provide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil\nlitigation.

These clients may also offer internally developed\nservices to their financial advisors, obviating the need to hire us, and they may offer these services to third-party financial advisors or financial\ninstitutions, thereby competing directly with us for that business.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.

We also face increased competition due to the current trend of industry consolidation. If\nlarge financial institutions that are not our clients are able to attract assets from our clients, our ability to generate future growth in revenues and\nearnings may be adversely affected.\nOur failure to successfully compete in any of the above-mentioned areas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\nfinancial condition or business. Competition could also affect the revenue mix of services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of\nbusiness with higher profit margins\nWe derive nearly all of our revenues from the delivery of investment solutions and services to clients in the financial advisory industry\nand our revenue could suffer if that industry experiences a downturn.\nWe derive nearly all of our revenues from the delivery of investment solutions and services to clients in the financial advisory industry and we\nare therefore subject to the risks affecting that industry. A decline or lack of growth in demand for financial advisory services would adversely\naffect our clients and, in turn, our results of operations, financial condition and business. For example, the availability of free or low-cost\ninvestment information and resources, including research and information relating to publicly traded companies and mutual funds available on\ndemand for our investment solutions and services among financial advisors could decline for many reasons. Consolidation or limited growth in\nthe financial advisory industry could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. Events that adversely affect our clients businesses,\nrates of growth or the numbers of customers they serve, including decreased demand for our clients products and services, adverse conditions in\nour clients  markets or adverse economic conditions generally, could decrease demand for our investment solutions and services and thereby\ndecrease our revenues. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nA limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue. Termination of our contracts with any of these clients could\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, revenues associated with our relationship with our single largest client, FMR LLC, an\naffiliate of FMR Corp., or Fidelity, accounted for 27%, 31% and 31% respectively, of our total revenues and our ten largest clients accounted fon\n63%, 66% and 62% respectively, of our total revenues. Our license agreements with large financial institutions are generally multi-year contracts\nthat may be terminated upon the expiration of the contract term or prior to such time for cause, which may include breach of contract,\nbankruptcy, insolvency and other reasons. Our license agreement with Fidelity does not have a specified term, but the license fee payments made\nto us by Fidelity under the license agreement cease on December 31, 2011. At such time, we will still receive ongoing platform services fees\nagreements with financial advisors generally provide for termination at any time. If our\n22\n27",

Our clients may, for a number of reasons, seek to negotiate a lower\nasset-based fee percentage. For example, an increase in the use of index-linked investment products by the clients of our financial advisor clients\nmay result in lower fees being paid to our clients, and our clients may in turn seek to negotiate lower asset-based fee percentages for our\nservices. In addition, as competition among our clients increases, they may be required to lower the fees they charge to their clients, which could\ncause them to seek to decrease our fees accordingly. Any of these factors could result in fluctuation or a decline in our asset-based fees, which\nwould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nChanges in market and economic conditions could lower the value of assets on which we earn revenues and could decrease the demand\nfor our investment solutions and services.\nAsset-based fees make up a significant portion of our revenues and several of our largest clients pay us on this basis. Asset-based fees\nrepresented 78%, 73% and 77% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. In addition, as a\nresult of the current trend of increased use of financial advisors by individual investors, we expect that asset-based fees will account for an\nincreasing percentage of our total revenues in the future. Significant fluctuations in securities prices may materially affect the value of the assets\nmanaged by our clients and may also influence financial advisor and investor decisions regarding whether to invest in, or maintain an investment\nin, a mutual fund or other investment solution.

In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur\nadditional expenses associated with our Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements.

Fetter Logic asserted claims against us in a separate suit and in a counterclaim filed November 30, 2009,\nand subsequently moved to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mllinois, for breaches of the investment agreement and \noperating agreement, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, copyright infringement,\nmisappropriation of trade secrets, an accounting, unjust enrichment and a declaratory judgment that Fetter Logic owns all rights in the contested\nintellectual property. Fetter Logic sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Both\ncases arose out of (1) an investment agreement, pursuant to which we purchased shares in Fetter Logic for approximately $5.7 million, and\n(2) an operating agreement, under which the parties agreed to integrate their respective software applications and develop and sell joint product\nofferings. Fetter Logic alleged that we did not comply with the terms of the operating agreement to develop joint product offerings, but instead \nmisappropriated Fetter Logic s intellectual property to develop products for our own benefit.\nOn July 8, 2010, the parties to the aforementioned litigation agreed to dismiss their respective lawsuits.

First, a majority of our revenues are derived from fees charged as a percentage of the\nassets that are managed or administered on our technology platform by financial advisors. These revenues are recorded under revenues from\nassets under management or administration. Our asset-based fees vary based on the types of investment solutions and services that financial\nadvisors utilize. Asset-based fees accounted for approximately 78%, 73% and 77% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008\n2009 and 2010, respectively. The percentage of our total revenues represented by asset-based fees declined in the year ended December 31, 2009\nprincipally due to the significant decline in the market value of the assets on our technology platform resulting from fluctuations in the securities\nmarkets, particularly from September 2007 to March 2009, and also due to our entering into a significant license agreement in 2008. U.S.-based\nequities appreciated significantly during the remainder of 2009 and throughout 2010 and contributed to an increase in our assets under\nattributable to asset-based fees is expected to vary based on fluctuations in securities markets, whether we enter into significant license\nagreements, the mix of assets under management, or AUM, and assets under administration, or AUA, and other factors. As of December 31,\n2010, approximately $64 billion of investment assets subject to asset-based fees were managed or administered utilizing our technology platform\nby approximately 13,800 financial advisors in approximately 307,000 investor accounts.\nnumber of enterprise clients. These revenues are recorded under revenues from licensing and professional services. Licensing fees are generally\nfixed in nature for the contract term and are based on the level of investment solutions and services provided, rather than on the amount of client\nassets on our technology platform. Licensing fees accounted for 19%, 24% and 20% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31,\n2008, 2009 and 2010. Fees received in connection with professional services accounted for the remainder of our total revenues. As of\nDecember 31, 2010, approximately $76 billion of investment assets for which we receive licensing fees for utilizing our technology platform\nwere serviced by approximately 7,700 financial advisors through approximately 604,000 investor accounts.\n40\n49",

We expect that this will continue to be the case in the future. Our board of directors is\nresponsible for determining the timing and magnitude of all option grants. Prior to our initial public offering on July 28, 2010, our board of\ndirectors, were responsible for determining the fair value of our common stock on the date of each stock option grant. The board of directors had\n delegated certain of its responsibilities to the compensation committe of the board of directors and certain members of management.

The value of our common stock was dependent upon our company\nvaluation and, as described below, we had periodically obtained independent valuations and performed internal valuations of our common stock.\nIn each case, such valuations had been performed contemporaneously and we had determined the fair market value of our company in\nconformity with commonly accepted corporate valuation techniques and methodologies.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we generally had obtained contemporaneous independent valuations at least annually and at the time of\nbroad-based option grants, such as on May 15, 2009 and February 22, 2010. For our internal valuations, we applied the same approach and\nmethodology used by the independent valuation firm. For any option grants made between quarterly valuations of our common stock, our board\nof directors assessed all available information in determining whether the stock price in effect at the time of the grant should otherwise be\n adjusted. As a private company, we had performed our quarterly valuations such that they were effective approximately 45 days following the\n end of each calendar quarter to approximate the date upon which, if we were a reporting company, we would be required to disclose to the\npublic through filings with the Commission our financial performance and associated operating metrics, which include assets under management\nand administration. Until such date, any information about a given quarter s financial performance, ending asset values, and other information\nin the valuation of our common stock during interim periods.\n In the specific cases of option grants made after the dates of our quarterly valuations during the period under review, our board of directors\n concluded that no adjustment should have been made to the most recent valuation of our common stock based on its assessment that, had we\n been a reporting company, no new material information would have been available to the public since the date of the prior valuation of our\ncommonstock.\n47\n59",
    "Page_60": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\nAs a private company, our company valuation, whether prepared by an independent valuation firm or performed internally, considered an\nincome approach, also known as a discounted cash flow analysis, incorporating our historical and expected financial performance, the relevant\nmarket and industry and economic trends. Our valuation also considered a market approach, including recent capital transactions involving\neither our company or comparable companies, and comparable public-company valuations. The resulting calculation assigned a value for 100%\nof our company s equity on a marketable equivalent, non-controlling interest basis. We considered, but did not include, an asset approach, as we\ndid not believe the book value of our assets provides meaningful input into our expected revenue and earnings, or the value of our company.\nWe believe the value of our common stock had the potential to change each fiscal quarter in the normal course of our business, since the\nmajority of our total revenues earned in a given quarter are calculated based on the value of AUM and AUA as of the end of the previous fiscal\nquarter. These revenues, and our historical resulting projections for earnings and cash flow, were inherently subject to fluctuations from quarter\nto quarter.\nAccordingly, as a private company, we calculated the value of our common stock at least once each fiscal quarter. The historical quarterly\nvaluations did at times fluctuate significantly as the market value of our assets under management or administration drives our near term\nfinancial results and longer term projections. The value of our common stock could also change if a material financing transaction or other\nsignificant event occurs within a given fiscal quarter. In such circumstances we performed an additional valuation of our common stock at the\ntime of the transaction or event, using the same valuation methodology that is utilized in connection with our quarterly valuations.\nAfter we determined a value for our company, we allocated the value to each class of our shares, including our common stock. Our value\nallocation methodology applies the principles set forth in the AICPA Practice Aid Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued\nas Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The Practice Aid defines appropriate methods to allocate enterprise value to common shares when\nmultiple share classes exist. Based on various factors, including the stage of a company s life and the timing and likelihood of various liquidity\nevents, one method of allocation may be more appropriate than the others. We considered, but did not use, the probability-weighted expected\nreturn method due to the number of assumptions for each scenario that are difficult to estimate, and the fact that our most likely liquidation event\nwas an initial public offering. Additionally, we did not apply the liquidation method because, as the Practice Aid indicates, it would be\ninappropriate for a later-stage company such as ours to use that method to allocate value to the various share classes. Furthermore, the more\nimminent a liquidity event becomes, the more aligned the liquidation model and option pricing model become in attributing value to each share\nclass. Accordingly, we used the option pricing method, as defined in the Practice Aid, which treats each class of equity as having a call option on\nthe enterprise value. The option pricing method considers the economic preferences and other rights attributable to each share class, resulting in\na price for each of our share classes, including our common stock. Our valuations of our common stock also reflected a discount for lack of\nmarketability, adjusted over time to reflect the expected likelihood and timing of a liquidity event subsequent to each valuation date. No other\ndiscounts were applied in determining the value of our common stock.\nDuring 2009 and through the date our initial public offering on July 28, 2010, we performed the following contemporaneous valuations of our\ncommon stock:\nFair Value of\nDate\nCommon Stock\n2/15/2009\n$\n7.85\n5/15/2009\n7.15\n8/15/2009\n9.90\n11/15/2009\n11.50\n2/15/2010\n13.45\nAs described above, the assets under management or administration on our technology platform at the end of a given quarter have a significant\nimpact on our short- and long-term financial projections and resulting\n48\n60",

For example, the valuation conducted on May 15, 2009 incorporated financial projections based on assets under management or\nadministration as of March 31, 2009. The value of those assets was 6% below the value of the assets as of December 31, 2008. This contributed\nto the decline in the estimated fair value of our common stock between periods. Conversely, assets under management or administration\nincreased 16% between March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, contributing to an increase in the estimated fair value of our common stock between\nMay 15, 2009 and August 15, 2009. In addition, assets under management or administration increased 15% between June 30, 2009 and\nSeptember 30, 2009, which contributed to the increase in the fair value of our common stock between August 15, 2009 and November 15, 2009.\nA 4% increase in assets under management or administration between September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, as well as our new\nagreement with FundQuest (see\n 2010 Developments ), contributed to the increase in the fair value of our common stock between November 15,\n2009 and February 15, 2010. The decrease between the fair value of our common stock on November 15, 2009 and February 15, 2010 and the\ninitial public offering price was principally attributable to volatility in the trading prices of the common stock of comparable companies and the\n this offering. Other factors, such as updated financial projections not related to changes in our assets under management or administration, as\nwell as fluctuations in the value of comparable publicly-traded companies, also contributed to the differences in the estimated fair value of our\ncommonstock betweenperiods.\nSince our initial public offering on July 28, 2010, we have not performed internal valuations or obtained independent valuations in order to\ndetermine the Company s stock price to reference when determining the fair value of our common stock in connection with the granting of stock\noptions.\nNon-cash stock-based compensation expense for stock option grants is estimated at the grant date based on each grant s fair value, calculated\nfair value of our stock options and the resulting expenses are based on various assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock price,\nthe expected term of the stock options, estimated forfeiture rates and the risk-free interest rate. The use of different assumptions would result in\ndifferent fair values and compensation and benefits expenses for our option grants.\nIncometaxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and India. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining\nour provision for income taxes.\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective\ntax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to\ntaxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized under income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date. We record a valuation\nallowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that we determine is more-likely-than-not to be realized in the future.\nIn our ordinary course of business, we may enter into transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In such cases, we\nestablish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on our estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The\nreserves are established when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax\nauthorities. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of an estimate.\nAlthough we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from\nthan the amounts recorded, such differences will be reflected in our provision for income taxes.

This\nincrease was primarily due to an increase in asset values applicable to our quarterly billing cycles in 2010, relative to those used in 2009. Our\n2010 revenues were positively affected by new account growth and positive net flows of AUM and AUA during the fourth quarter of 2009\nthrough September 30, 2010, as well as an increase in market value of AUM and AUA from the fourth quarter of 2009 to September 30, 2010.\nNew account growth and positive net flows of AUM and AUA resulted from continued efforts to increase the number of financial advisors and\naccounts on our technology platform and the implementation of the FundQuest assets on our technology platform.

The revised guidance provides for two\nsignificant changes to the existing multiple element revenue arrangement guidance. The first change relates to the determination of when \nindividual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. The second change modifies\nthe manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables. This guidance also significantly\nexpands the disclosures required for multiple-element revenue arrangements. The guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning on\n or after June 15, 2010, but early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our\n consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible\nproducts and software elements so that tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to\ndeliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in Accounting Standards\n Codification ( ASC ） Subtopic 985-605. In addition, this guidance requires hardware components of a tangible product containing software\ncomponents always be excluded from the software revenue guidance. The guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning on or after\nJune 15, 2010, but early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate the impact of the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on\nour consolidated financial statements.\n60\n76",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarketrisk\nOur exposure to market risk is directly related to revenues from asset management or administration services earned based upon a contractual\npercentage of AUM or AUA. In the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, 78%, 73% and 77% of our revenues, respectively, were\nderived from revenues based on the market value of AUM or AUA. We expect this percentage to vary over time. A decrease in the aggregate\nvalue of AUM or AUA may cause our revenue and income to decline.\nForeign currency risk\nThe expenses of our India subsidiary, which primarily consist of expenditures related to compensation and benefits, are paid using the Indian\ndollars. As of December 31, 2010, we estimate that a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the Indian Rupee to the U.S. dollar would result\nin a decrease of $0.4 million to pre-tax earnings and a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the Indian Rupee to the U.S. dollar would result\nin a $0.3 million increase to pre-tax earnings.\nInterest raterisk\nWe have no floating interest rate debt and therefore we are not directly exposed to interest rate risk.\n61\n77",

Such services include investment manager due diligence and\nresearch, portfolio diagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, portfolio\nperformance reporting and monitoring solutions, billing, and back office and middle-office operations and administration.\n Investment decisions for assets under management or administration are made by our customers.

Fees related to assets under management or administration increase or decrease based on\nvalues of existing customer accounts. The values are affected by inflows or outflows of customer funds and market fluctuations.\nLicensing and professional services fees The Company derives licensing fees from recurring contractual fixed fee contracts with\nlarger financial institutions or enterprise clients. Licensing contracts allow the customer to provide a unique configuration of\nplatform features and investment solutions for their advisers. The licensing fees vary based on the type of services provided and\nour revenues received under license agreements are recognized over the contractual term.\n The Company s license agreements do not generally provide its customers the ability to take possession of its software or host the software on its\nown systems or through a hosting arrangement with an unrelated party. However, in a certain instance, a customer has the ability to take\npossession of the software, and accordingly, the Company considers this circumstance as a multiple-element arrangement. As a multiple element\narrangement, the Company is required to determine whether there is vendor specific objective evidence ( VsOE ) of the various elements,\naccordingly, recognizes revenue from these arrangements at such time as all elements of the arrangement have been delivered.\nAdditionally, the Company derives professional service fees from providing contractual customized service platform software development,\nand generally specify or quantify interim deliverables.\nSubstantially all of the Company s revenues are based on contractual arrangements.

Generally,\nthese expenses are calculated based upon a contractual percentage of the market value of assets held in customer accounts measured as of the\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible fee\nreceivables. In establishing the amount of the allowance, customer-specific information is considered related to delinquent accounts, including\npast lost experience and current economic conditions.\nSegments  The Company s chief operating decision maker is its chief executive officer, who reviews financial information presented on a\nconsolidated basis. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments, net of any allowances, including cash equivalents, fees\nreceivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values due to their\nshort-term nature.\nCash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to\nbe cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company s financial instruments that are\nexposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash accounts at financial\ninstitutions in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Company monitors such credit risk and has\nnot experienced any losses related to such risk.\nInvestments  Investments are recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment. Investments are included in  Other non-current assets  on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and consist of non-marketable investments in privately held companies as well as other alternative investments. The\nCompany reviews these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these investments.

Such indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources, limited\nprospects of receiving additional financing, and prospects for liquidity of the related securities. Impaired investments are written down to\nestimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies, including comparing the investee with\ndiscounted future cash flows.\nProperty and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of furniture and\nequipment is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Leasehold improvements are\namortized on the straight-line basis over their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Improvements\nare capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. Assets are tested for recoverability whenever events\nor circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable\nCustomer Inducements Payments made to customers as an inducement are capitalized and amortized against revenue on a straight-line basis over\nthe term of the agreement.\nInternally Developed Software Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has\nreached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete\nand ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. The Company also capitalizes costs related to\nspecific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Maintenance and training costs\nare expensed as incurred. Internally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Management evaluates\n the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact\nthe recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments of internally developed software during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009\nand 2010.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses\nacquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment each year using a two-step process that is performed at least annually or whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The Company has concluded that it has a single reporting unit. The first step is a\nexceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary. If the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of\nthe goodwill to a determination of the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied value,\nan impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The implied value of the goodwill is determined as of the test date by performing a purchase\nprice allocation, as if the reporting unit had just been acquired, using currently estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the\nreporting unit, together with an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole. The estimate of the fair value of the reporting\nunit is based upon information available regarding prices of similar groups of assets, or other valuation techniques including present value\ntechniques based upon estimates of future cash flow. No impairment charges have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009\nand 2010.\n70\n90",

There were no impairments to long-lived assets during the years ended December 31,\n2008, 2009 and 2010.\nLeases In certain circumstances, the Company enters into leases with free rent periods, rent escalations or lease incentives over the term of the\nlease. In such cases, we calculate the total payments over the term of the lease and record them ratably as rent expense over that term.\nIncome Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for\nthe future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and\ntheir respective tax bases and net operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected\nto apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax\nassets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a\nvaluation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not.\nThe Company follows authoritative guidance related to how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, disclosed and presented in\nthe audited consolidated financial statements. This requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of\nexamined by the applicable tax authority.

The tax benefits recognized in the audited consolidated financial statements from tax positions are\nmeasured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nAdvertising Costs The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred and they are classified within general and administration expenses.\nAdvertising costs totaled approximately $1,071, $1,021 and $1,160 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.\nstock-based compensation plan.

In assessing the\nrealizability of this deferred tax asset, management determined that it was more-likely-than-not that all of this asset would not be realized and\naccordingly recorded an increase to our valuation allowance in the amount of $926. The valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets as of\nDecember 31, 2009 and 2010 was $2,517 and $3,444, respectively. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2009 was related to capital\nlosses of $1,230 and Federal and state net operating losses of $1,287 primarily due to Section 382 limitations. The valuation allowance as of\nDecember 31, 2010 was related to capital losses of $2,157 and Federal and state net operating losses of $1,287 primarily due to Section 382\nlimitations. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the\ndeferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which net operating\nlosses and temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities (including\nthe impact of available carry-back and carry-forward periods), projected taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment.\nIn order to fully realize the deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax\nassets governed by the tax code. Based on the level of taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the\nnet operating losses are available and deferred tax assets are deductible, management of the Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that\nit will realize the benefits of the net operating losses and any other deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable\n however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\npurposes,\nUpon exercise of stock options, the Company recognizes any difference between U.S. GAAP compensation expense and income tax\ncompensation expense as a tax windfall or shortfall. The difference is charged to equity in the case of a windfall. When the exercise results in a\nwindfall and the windfall results in net operating loss ( NOL ), or the windfall increases an NOL carryforward, no windfall is recognized until the\ndeduction reduces the income tax payable. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Company has deferred the recognition of approximately $523 in\nwindfall tax benefits associated with its stock-based compensation until a tax cash savings is realized. The benefit will be recorded in\nstockholder s equity when utilized on an income tax return to reduce taxes payable, and as such, it will not impact the Company s effective tax\nrate.\nAs of December 31, 2010, the Company has not provided for taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of $1,596 that it considers permanently\nreinvested.\n82\n110",

Historically, determining the fair value of our common stock required making subjective judgments. The valuation of our\ncommon stock considered a market approach and an income approach, incorporating the Company s historical and expected financial\nperformance, relevant market, industry and economic trends, recent capital transactions, involving either the Company or comparable\ncompanies, and comparable public company valuations.

Based on various factors, including the stage of a company s life and the timing and likelihood of various liquidity\nevents, one method of allocation may be more appropriate than the others. The Company used the option pricing method, as defined in the\nPractice Aid, which treats each class of equity as having a  call option  on the enterprise value. The option pricing method considers the economic\npreferences and other rights attributable to each share class, resulting in a price for each of the share classes, including common stock. The\nvaluations of common stock also reflected a discount for lack of marketability, adjusted over time to reflect the expected likelihood and timing\nstock. There was inherent uncertainty in the estimates used in the valuations.

Under the two class method, net income is allocated between\ncommon stock and other participating securities based on their respective participating rights. All classes of convertible preferred stock would\nparticipate pro rata in dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. Therefore, the two class method of calculating net income\nper common share has been applied. Basic net income per common share excludes dilution for potential common stock issuances and is\ncomputed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the\nperiod. Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common\nstock were exercised or converted into common stock, unless they are anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010,\nconvertible preferred securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as their inclusion on an as if converted basis\nwould have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, the convertible preferred securities are considered anti-dilutive\nas a result of such securities not having the contractual obligation to participate in losses of the Company.
