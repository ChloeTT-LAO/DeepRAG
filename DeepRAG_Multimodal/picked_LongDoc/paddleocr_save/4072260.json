    "Page_4": "ExecutiveSummary\nThank you for your interest in DefendX Software MobilityTm. The latest addition to the DefendX\nSoftware? product portfolio, DefendX Software Mobility enables employees to tier files; users\ncan select from a predefined set of criteria such as file size, age of last access, or other criteria\n(Right-Click Data Movementrm), and organizations can also establish policies that automatically\ntier files as users reach their storage limits (Event-Driven Data Movementm). Both methods\nenable companies to control storage and operating costs and to expedite backups.\nDefendx Software Mobility makes it much easier for customers to control costs and\nconsolidate data so that it can be searched and leveraged as needed. Defendx Software\ncontinues its innovation in file-based storage management with the ultimate objective of\nhelping customers reduce storage capital and operating costs.\nSystem Overview\nYour goal is to categorize your data, properly manage it, and move the right data to the most\nappropriate storage tier to reduce costs, address compliance issues, and perform electronic\ndiscovery. However, most archival solutions require expensive, repeated scans of the entire\nfile system. Even worse, large, infrequently used files can reside in your primary storage for\nmonths! Defendx Software Mobility allows for flexibility in your approach to data migration\nwith automated policy-driven movement, manual user driven movement, or a combination of\nboth. You decide what is best for your organization. Defendx Software Mobility redefines the\neconomics of data movement by being event- and policy- driven in real time, rather than\nrelated costs.\nBrowser Settings\nYou need to have the \"Allow Active Scripting\" under\nProperties>Security>Locallntranet>CustomSecurity enabled. This may require you to add the\nweb admin's server to your local intranet sites. If this option is disabled then the admin site's\nleft-hand main menu will not be able to expand.\nDEFENDX\nCopyright?2019DefendXSoftware\n4\nSoftware",
