Various properties of food carbohydrates\ncan be traced to their different molecular structures, and to the roles that they played in plants - energy\nstorage, hydration, support, protection, transport. When plants are consumed, carbohydrate properties\nbecome nutritional attributes that our bodies have become dependent on in evolution. In a natural diet\nconsisting of a variety of whole foods - fruits, vegetables and grains - carbohydrates provide a balance\nof properties. With advanced food processing functional balance has been disrupted. Carbohydrates\nthat regulated digestibility and provided roughage have been removed, along with associated nutrients\nconsumed, and readily digested. At the same time, the average person has become somewhat\nconstipated, obese, and glucose intolerant, with an increased chance of dying prematurely of colorectal\ncancer, heart disease or of some other complication of diabetes. Carbohydrates have unjustifiably been\nblamed. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, food scientists and technologists are trying to put nature\nback together again in an avalanche of “functional' foods. Unfortunately, there is still no consistently\npredictable way for consumers to tell which foods will really provide the benefits that are expected or\nclaimed of them, and by how much one food is better than another. There is a need for new types of\ninformation that will assist choice of healthy foods by communicating functional efficacy. Virtual food\ncomponents representing food effects may fill this role.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe structure of sugars and their ability to act as units in a vast range of polymeric\ncombinations, each with different properties, gave them a central role in the evolution of plant life as\nwe know it. And similarly, with plants forming the base of human diets, the persisting properties of\n plant carbohydrates have shaped the structure and function of the human gut.\n Food carbohydrates have recently been maligned as the source of many of the health problems\nthat afflict the modern world, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Yet, with a gastrointestinal system so\nobviously designed for the presence of carbohydrates, it cannot be carbohydrates per se that are a\nproblem, but behaviors that determine the patterns in which carbohydrates are provided and consumed\nin the modern human diet. Indeed, the many properties and arrangements of carbohydrates in plants\nthat influence how foods are digested are now recognized as more than nutritionally incidental; they are\n2001).\nFunctional characteristics of natural polysaccharide associations\nIntheforegut\nProperties of the different forms of carbohydrates consumed in plant-based foods can be\ntraced to their molecular structure, and to the various functions that they have been asked to perform in\nthe plant kingdom - energy storage, hydration, support, protection, transport. Table 1 summarizes some\n of the functions of carbohydrates in plants, and the response of the gut to these properties. Of the\npolysaccharides, only starch, α-1,4-1,6 linked glucose can be digested by human enzymes.\nThe structure of the human gut reflects the processes used to obtain nutrients from within the\npolysaccharide skeleton of the plant, and to then make use of the residue. At the front end teeth\ncoarsely but incompletely crush the food to release a proportion of soluble components and allow\naccess of digestive enzymes. The mouth, stomach and small intestine are the gut sites where human\nenzymes digest accessible and soluble nutrients.",

Binding of\n Prevention of colonic stagnation.\ncellulosic\n genotoxins\nIn the foregut the cell wall residue remains chemically intact and retains most of its properties.\n Important amongst these is the hydrated volume of the cell wall material. Bulky, hydrated, gel-like\nplant cell wall and tissue particles in the gut have the important net effect of reducing the rate and\nextent of nutrient absorption, not only by diluting nutrients and extending their digestion along the\nsmall intestine (Schneeman, 1998), but by simultaneously stimulating secretion of mucins, which may\nfurther retard absorption by increasing viscosity at the gut-lumen boundary (Tanabe et al., 2005). Apart\nfrom the simple effects of bulk, cell wall particles can act as pectic gels reinforced by the cellulose and\nhemicellulosic polysaccharides embedded in them, so they possess a porosity that can retard the\nmovement of molecules (Pena et al., 2001).\n As well as attenuating the absorption of mono- and disaccharides, dietary fibre in the form of\nencapsulating cell walls limits the digestion of starch in any cells that have escaped crushing. Not \nsurprisingly, a strong negative relationship has been found between dietary fibre content and the\nglycemic impact of foods (Englyst et al, 1996).\nIn the hind gut\nAs food residues move into the colon the gut environment changes drastically. In the colon,\nundigested materials enter an ecosystem in which a complex and diverse population of bacteria attacks\nmost organic food components, to an extent limited by the properties of the material and the time for\nwhich it resides in the colon.\nRather than being simple a waste storage and disposal unit, the colon is a large and active\norgan that makes an important contribution to health, especially under the dietary conditions for which\nit evolved - a high intake of cell wall residues representing a valuable energy and mineral resource for\nthe body.\n In the colonic environment a new range of cell wall properties exert their influence:\n Carbohydrate, mainly polysaccharide, that is susceptible to bacteria provides a substrate for\n             \nsignificant source of energy to the body (Wolf, 2006), as well as specifically nourishing the colon and\nstimulating its own protective mechanisms, including immune and apoptotic responses (Gibson, et al.,\n 2005). The low pH environment induced by SCFA production facilitates mineral uptake so that the\ncolon makes an important contribution to calcium and magnesium recovery (Coxam, 2005), while the\nlow pH inhibits pathogenic pH-sensitive bacteria (Bruno et al.,2002)",

The contributing\npolysaccharides are those which fulfill a structural role in the plant, so include cell wall\npolysaccharides that are organized into strong, slowly digested semi-crystalline associations, such as\ncellulose microfibrils, or in which polysaccharides are protected by resistant coatings such as lignin and\nsuberin. Faecal bulk is important in stimulating defecation, which has a number of indirect benefits,\nsummarized in Table 2 (Monro, 2000a).\nTable2Direct and indirect effects of bulk provided by fermentation-resistant polysaccharide\nassociations in thelargeintestine\nProperty/Effect\nConsequent effect\nBulkiness\n Bulk transfer, replenishment\nBulk transfer\nToxin removal, colonic exposure reduced, decreased transit time.\n Decreased transit time\nLess protein putrefaction to genotoxic nitrogenous products.\nLess time for dehydration.\nIncreased water load\n Diluted colon contents, stool softening, pressure distribution.\nReplenishment\n Substrates for bacterial growth and fermentation to short chain fatty\nacids: butyrate (protection) and decreased pH (calcium uptake, pathogen\nsuppression)\nBinding\nReduced toxin/carcinogen activity.\nDistension\nDefecation stimulus.\nDefeacation\nComfort and maintained colonic flow.\nFood processes such as milling, refining and juicing have been designed to release digestible\npolysaccharides from their natural packaging of cell walls, and usually to discard the cell wall residue.\nThe functional balance in carbohydrates for which the digestive system was designed has been\ndisrupted. Carbohydrates with important structural and hydrating roles in the plant, and which\nconstrained digestibility and provided roughage in the gut, have been removed along with their\nassociated nutrients (Atwell, 2002). The benefits outlined in Table 1 have been diminished.\nSome examples of the effect of various forms of refining are to be seen in Figures 1 to 3. In Figure 1\nthe swelling of insoluble vegetable (carrot, swede, asparagus, broccoli pith) material prepared by a mild\nwater-extraction is shown after gastric and ileal digestion in vitro. Compared with the vegetable\nmaterial, cell wall material in the form of sugar beet fibre, and apple fibre, both of which have been\nhighly processed, show a much lesser degree of swelling. Nonetheless, commercially available dietary\nfibre sources are commonly promoted as ingredients that will confer the functional benefits of dietary\nfibre on foods containing them as an ingredient.\nThe nutritional influence of the simple food refinement step of removing the rind from\nvegetables is seen in Figure 2, which shows results of a faecal bulking trial in which dietary fibre\nsources were included at 12.5% of the diet by replacing sucrose. The broccoli rind contains vessels and\nfibres constructed of secondarily thickened cell walls, so can partially resist fermentation and retain its\nanatomical integrity through the colon. The polysaccharides and the interstices within fibres of the rind\nconfer a considerable water holding capacity, greater than that due to wheat bran, which translates into\na 212% increase in colonic water load per 100 g intake of the rind enriched food, compared with the\nbaseline (Figure 2).

The\npith consists of thin-walled cells with little secondary thickening that are readily fermented in the\ncolon. The results show that a simple strategy, not peeling, aimed at retaining a natural polysaccharide\n association considerably enhanced functional efficacy.\nFIGURE 1 Swelling of native vegetable cell walls under post-gastric ileal conditions in vitro compared\nwith swelling of highly processed fibre sources (orange QF10, sugar beet fibre, apple fibre AF400)\nunderthesameconditions.\nSwelling/gram (mL/g)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nCarrot\nSwede\nAsparagus\nBrocolli pith \n Psyllium\nOrange (QF10)\nSugar beet\nfibre\nApple (AF400)\nFIGURE 2 The effect of removing the rind from broccoli stem on the theoretical water transfer\nthrough the colon.

Refined flour makes up a substantial proportion of processed foods and is responsible for a\nlarge proportion of the glycaemic loading of modern diets (Liu, 2002). Figure 3 shows the relationship\nbetween size of cooked cereal particles and the content of rapidly digested (highly glycaemic), slowly\nrapidly available starch drops abruptly, and it is replaced more by an increase in resistant starch than by\nan increase in slowly digested starch.\nThe results in Figure 3 provide another example of how the maintenance of natural structure,\nin the form of semi-intact endosperm fragments, can have a profound effect on the functionality of a\n  si i q  s o  p s is d  o\nremaining to act as a fermentable substrate for colonic bacteria, to a less digestible starch source with a\nlarge proportion of starch remaining in the grain to act as colonic substrate.

Samples for analysis are routinely\nfinely ground to ensure that all potentially digestible nutrients are extracted. Rates and degrees of\ncarbohydrate digestion in vivo are, however, determined by many structural features of foods (Venn\nand Mann, 2004).

The results of simple nutrient analysis do not provide such\n information. Nutrtional atributes such as moderate digestibility, fermentability, faecal bulking,",

The concept of virtual food components (VFC) was introduced to provide consumers with the\n s  s s o  n q    g o ‘o u \naccurately promoting their “functional' products according to efficacy.\nA VFC expresses the effect of a food as the weight of a reference material required to induce\nthe same amount of effect as a given weight of the food. A VFC is, therefore, expressed in terms of an\nequivalent weight of the reference material. For instance, to say that a muesli bar has a relative\nglycaemic impact of 15 glycaemic glucose equivalents (GGE), means that the muesli bar will induce\nthe same glycaemic response as 15 g glucose (Monro 2002a). Similarly, if the same bar contributes\nfour wheat bran equivalents (WBE), it will augment faecal bulk by the same amount as 4 g wheat bran\n(Monro 2001).\nBecause a VFC is expressed as a weight of reference, it may be presented in the same terms as\nother food components in food composition databases and nutrient information panels, as g/serving or\ng/100 g food, or as grams per specified food quantity (Monro, 2005). However, because VFCs\nrepresent responses to foods, it is likely that their values will be modulated by the presence of other\nfood components and foods in the diet. Nonetheless, if one assumes that response to the reference and\nto food will be similarly affected by the food/digesta matrix, and remembering that a VFC is a relative\nvalue, it is possible to say that VFCs may be used as guides to selecting foods that are relatively more\nefficacious or healthy than others within a range of diets.\nRecommended levels of functional food components do not necessarily provide functional balance.\nOne of the reasons why there is a need for VFCs is that a single nutrient value in a nutrient\ninformation panel, such as dietary fibre, can represent a class of components with quite diverse\nproperties, and be used as such in marketing without allowing for functional diversity, because food\nstandards are based on a single criterion value. Calci Trim? “Liquid breakfast\", “High in Calcium and\nFibre” is one of many examples. As a “liquid breakfast” the consumer could reasonably expect a\nhealthy balance in a main meal, but examination of the NIP of the product reveals that of the 3.75 g per\nserving of dietary fibre present, 3.25 g is oligosaccharide, so will have little direct rheological effect in\nthe ileum, and will be completely fermented in the colon, so make little contribution to faecal bulk.\nThus although the criterion level of 3g/serving required for a claim of “high in fibre”\" is reached the\nvague term “dietary fibre” provides no information about the level of benefit achieved (Monro, 2002b).\nIf the functionality could be represented by VFCs, the information could be more informatively\npresented as 3.25 g inulin equivalents, to show its relative prebiotic potential, and 0.3 g wheat bran\nequivalents (WBE) to show its relative faecal bulking capacity (Monro, 2002c). Such data would alert\nthe nutritionist, if not the consumer, to the fact that although the product may have some prebiotic\neffect, it would probably contribute little to an adequate daily intake of about 60 WBE (Monro, 2004b).\nVirtual food components in personal well-being based on genotypic and holistic analysis - the\nfuture?\nand food choices per se, but also on many dimensions of life that constitute ‘well-being'. Food choices,\nstress, exercise, and social inclusion, for instance, are all lifestyle factors that impinge on well-being.\nFurthermore, with the advent of genotyping, a list of susceptibilities may be added to the dimensions of\nwell-being that could be addressed at the level of individual nutrition and living.\nwhich virtual food components are well suited: they express food effects in relative terms that can be\ntranslated into an informed food choice based on efficacy, and they express functionality in the same\ngram weight format as real nutrients, so they may be stored in a food composition database and used\nconcurrently with nutrients in individualised meal design (Monro and Williams, 2000).",

ROWAN\nFonterra Research Centre, Palmerston North, New Zealand\nINTRODUCTION\nConsumers are increasingly looking for solutions to manage their health, to protect against\nillness and to delay the onset of age-related ailments. They are also looking to aid quality of life when\nill health strikes or when health is compromised (e.g. when cancer is diagnosed). It is a widely held\n belief that, as the proportion of older consumers increases, there will be new demand for products that\nsupport healthy aging — to slow the onset of age-related disorders that impact on our quality of life.\nOne of the largest targets of the functional foods and nutraceuticals business may well be those in the\n50-65 year age group who have disposable income to spend but are also motivated to manage their\nhealth and wellness. Trends in sales of dietary supplements and so-called functional foods and\nbeverages grew through the late 1990s and early this century (Euromonitor, 2004), suggesting a\ngrowing belief in the benefits of these “natural’ approaches to disease prevention or management.\nHowever, more recent surveys suggest a slowing in that growth. This review discusses some of the\nhurdles to success in functional foods and provides some suggestions for managing innovation to\nmaximise the chances of success.\nCurrent Market Issues forFunctional Foods\nCurrent estimates of the size of the global functional foods market are up to US$50-60 billion\n(Table 1), and some have predicted that the market will grow to US$167 billion by 2010 (Anon, 2004).\nWithin current estimates of the market, growth is predicted to increase in dairy products and to decline\nin most other categories in the US, but to decline across all categories in Europe (Datamonitor, 2005).\nThe European market is a smaller and perhaps a maturing market, or it may be that the lack of growth\nreflects stifling by regulatory barriers.\nTable 1.

Finland is often referred to as the birthplace of functional foods. However, the functional\nfoods regulatory framework originated in Japan, which is the only country to have a specific regulatory\nprocess to define, and approve, foods or food ingredients for specific health use (FOSHU). Other",

The onus on relevant, understandable and accurate consumer\neducation and marketing will be great. Overlaying this is the requirement to meet regulatory criteria\nincluding substantiating health claims and demonstrating the safety of new dietary ingredients (e.g.\nbioactives). This ensures that any risks associated with the consumption of new “foods\"’ or ingredients\nperhaps at doses not traditionally observed -\nwill be eliminated or minimised.\nIt is important to understand the target market before starting the innovation process for a new\nproduct. The size of the market is needed to calculate the predicted future value, so allowing some way\nof choosing one opportunity from another for investment and development. Understanding the market\nwill also allow you to analyse the competition, and this will be in the form of other foods, bioactives,\nsupplements and pharmaceuticals. Knowledge of the target market, channels to market and consumer\ncharacteristics will also help to shape the type of product and claims needed. For example, a blood-\ncholesterol-lowering probiotic that needs to be delivered as a yoghurt product may not be successful\nwith older adults who do not traditionally consume yoghurt, or for the US where the concept of\nprobiotics is still not well understood or accepted.\nInnovation Management\n Developing a successful food for the future is more than just developing a product that you\n can demonstrate confers some benefit. Although this is clearly important, there are many other criteria\nthat must be met and factors that must be managed through the process of idea to commercialisation\n(Figure 1). There are many ways to go about the development of a new product concept, and the steps\nand the order of the stages may differ with each opportunity. Some activities, such as reassessing the\nthe process.\nFigure 1.Journey from idea to proof of concept and commercialisation: success signposts for\nfunctionalfooddevelopment.\nHealth target\nTechnical\nEfficacy, claims\nCommunication,\nMarket\neducation\nProduct\nfeasibility,\ndefined\nsubstantiation\nlaunch\nassessed\nNPD\nprogramme\nConcept value\nBioactive\n Intellectual\nSafety\nRegulatory\nproposition\ndiscovery/\nproperty,\nassessment\napproval\nselection,\nFTO\nformulation\nwork\nGaining some protection from competitors in the market is attractive, and the process of\nmanaging intellectual property is important, although it can be expensive and lengthy. If there is a\nprogramme of discovery of new bioactives, or perhaps a novel process is invented in the course of\ndeveloping the product, then intellectual property can be captured through a patent or trade secret.\n Often a more pragmatic approach is to get into the market first with your new product and capture the\nbenefits first. Of course, there is an element of risk in this, as you may need to make the largest\ninvestment in consumer education if the concept is new. Also, if you have had to make a large\ninvestment in clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy, then some protection against second comers is\nalways desired. Another aspect to managing intellectual property that is less well appreciated and\nunderstood is being able to demonstrate that you have “Freedom to Operate\". Although your idea may",
    "Page_12": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 12\nbe great and the market need high, if someone else has already covered your idea in a patent, then you\nwill be infringing their intellectual property if you commercialise the idea without being granted a\nimportant part of innovation management.\nTechnical feasibility is also obviously important. There are many aspects to this, not only in\nthe product development or process development phases but also in terms of the cost of the product. A\nsimple example is the cost of adding a bioactive into a food product. If the cost of the dose of the\ningredient needed to deliver the claimed benefit is too high, then the product will not be successful\nunless the consumer is prepared to pay the premiums required. Furthermore, the dose of the active\ncomponents may affect the food matrix, reducing stability or shelf life, affecting taste, colour and\nflavour or in fact reducing the properties of other bioactive components such as vitamins and minerals.\n It is well known that increasingly consumers will not compromise on taste, convenience and, to a lesser\n extent, price, just to get a health benefit from their food.\nHealth Targets\nA commercially focused innovation programme to deliver a pipeline of commercialisable new\ntargets determined? Many different sources of information are available to help to define the most\nappropriate targets for functional food ingredients. We can either look at current health concerns or\nattempt to predict future concerns and unmet needs by analysing the data available. For example,\nmortality statistics such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) population-based summaries\nconsider both leading causes of death and the trends (Table 2). Cardiovascular diseases are still the\nleading causes of death in the developed world, but there is a growing trend in deaths due to some\ntypes of cancer.\nTable 2. Global mortality statistics and ranking of cause of death in adults (Beaglehole et al., 2004)\nAdults aged 15-59 years\nAdults aged 60+ years\nDeaths\nDeaths\nRank/Cause\n(000s)\nRank/Cause\n(000s)\n1 HIV/AIDS\n2279\n 1  Ischaemic heart disease\n5825\n 2  Ischaemic heart disease\n1332\n 2  Cerebrovascular disease\n4689\n3  Tuberculosis\n1036\n 3  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n2399\n4  Road traffic injuries\n814\n 4  Lower respiratory infections\n1396\n5  Cerebrovascular disease\n783\n 5  Trachea, bronchus, lung cancers \n928\n 6  Self-inflicted injuries\n672\n6  Diabetes mellitus\n754\n 7  Violence\n 7  Hypertensive heart disease\n735\n473\n8  Cirrhosis of the liver\n382\n8Stomach cancer\n605\n9  Lower respiratory infections\n352\n9 Tuberculosis\n495\n10 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n343\n10 Colon and rectum cancers\n477\nIt may be more relevant to consider what conditions or diseases consumers are trying to avoid\n or manage. This may provide insights in order to provide solutions to prevent disease or reduce the risk\nof disease. Table 3 lists the leading causes of morbidity, or disease burden, calculated as disability-\nadjusted life years (DALYs), which combine years of life lost through premature death with years of\nlife with disability. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of “\"healthy” life. Again, heart\n disease and stroke lead for impact on quality of life in older adults, whereas infectious/immune system\n disorders, such as AIDS and tuberculosis, and depression are greater causes of morbidity in younger\nadults.\nTaken together, the WHO statistics demonstrate that ischaemic heart disease and\n cerebrovascular disease are the two primary causes of mortality and disease burden, especially among\nolder adults (Beaglehole et al., 2004). In developed countries, these two diseases are responsible for\n 36% of deaths, and death rates are higher for men than for women. It is interesting to note that the",
    "Page_13": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 3013\nWHO is actively calling for consumers to use prevention as a tool against heart disease, underlying the\nopportunities for food and beverage manufacturers developing heart health products. Given the\nprevalence of HIV/AIDS and related deaths in younger adults, in developed countries, this may also\n provide new opportunities for functional foods targeted at management of the condition.\nTable 3.

Several consumer surveys in the US have indicated that weight issues, heart disease, cancer\n and joint pain are the most common conditions that consumers are trying to manage or prevent with\nfood purchase (IFIC, 2000; 2002; Sloan, 2002; 2003). A survey of leaders in the food industry also\nranked obesity, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anti-aging and bone health as the most important\nconsumer concerns (Lewis, 2004).\nPerhaps it is not surprising to find that products aimed at heart health are predicted to be\namong the leading functional food trends in coming years (Datamonitor, 2005), along with the more\npredictable bone, gut and immune health products (Table 4). The predicted trends are as follows:\n heart and cardiovascular health;\nbone health and osteoporosis;\n gut health and immunity;\n cancer and preventative health;\n prevention of neural tube defects;\nage- and gender-related health;\nmental acuity and brain health;\n physical performance and sports health.\nTable 4.

    "Page_14": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 14\nMellentin (2005) has also made some predictions for health trends in the more immediate\nfuture. Included in this list are intrinsic health benefits for everyday foods, personalised nutrition and\nthe transition of supplement ingredients into foods. Discovery of novel bioactives for targeted health\nuses can underpin each of these trends.\nProof of Concept: Efficacy and Safety\nWhether discovering new bioactive components or investigating the nutritional and health\nbenefits of traditional foods, we need to manage the process of generating the evidence to underpin\nconsumer messages and health claims. The discovery process through to commercialisation, following\nthe drug development models, is made up of five stages.\nDiscovery, including production or synthesis of the test compounds and screening in\nbioactivity assays.\nPreclinical investigation, including animal trial, dose/response, mechanism of action investigation.\ns  n sis  s n s ns  s  a \nmetabolic fate, safety, dose/response. In pharmaceutical development in the US, this stage is registered\nas an Investigational New Drug Application with the USFDA.\nPhase Il clinical trials, using patients with the target disease, are larger than Phase I trials and are\ndesigned to generate safety data and preliminary efficacy data.\nPhase Ill clinical trials are typically large and multi-centred, and provide confirmation of efficacy and\nfurther safety data (e.g. side effects from use). In pharmaceutical development, this is the pre-approval\nstage.\nThe process is less clearly defined for functional foods, dietary supplements and bioactive\ningredients, and will depend on the market, the nature of the desired claim and the format of the\nproduct (supplement versus food). However, in the absence of prescribed criteria for demonstrating\nefficacy, increasingly companies are using the drug development model for functional food ingredients,\nalthough perhaps on a smaller scale at Phases II/Ill. The closer we move to the pharmaceutical model\nfor demonstrating efficacy, the greater will be our investment in research and development for\nfunctional foods and nutraceuticals. Therefore, we need to have clearly defined criteria for focusing on\nour best chances for success, and to manage our investment in a staged way.\nIt is difficult to really value a future opportunity without knowing what your active ingredient\ndoes or at what level it needs to be consumed to give a clear consumer benefit. So, gaining early proof\nof concept is important for filtering out the less promising opportunities and selecting the more\nfavourable. What defines appropriate or adequate “proof of concept\"? Early in discovery, the\nconfirmation that a new component or fraction has some bioactivity is an early indicator and may be\nenough to warrant a provisional patent. However, evidence from in vivo studies is more convincing and\ngenerally gives some sense of the effective dose required. This information can be used to firm up any\ncalculations of potential financial value. In vivo data are also usually preferred to robust any patents at\nthe final filing and patent claims stage. Animal model data may also be required before taking a novel\ningredient into human studies, to demonstrate safety. Formal safety and toxicological testing is also\nrequired for new ingredients in most markets, and increasingly food companies are requiring that\nauthorised safety approval has been attained, e.g. FDA GRAS approval.\nCommunication is a key part of the commercialisation strategy. Communication of the science\nwill underpin the consumer education and the eventual marketing and promotion of the functional\ningredient, but it needs to be timed appropriately. All intellectual property capture needs to be initiated\nbefore public disclosure of an invention. Part of the communication strategy may be trademarking to\nfurther protect your commercial utility. This may help to avoid the situation whereby another company\ncan add the component to its product and make a content claim, and by association benefit from all the\nhard work done by the owner or licensee of the intellectual property in terms of consumer education of\nthe benefits of that component. As consumers relate the component to the benefit, each product appears\nto be equally efficacious once consumers are aware of the component's benefits. So, communication\nneeds to co-ordinated and managed alongside other commercialisation activities, and having the right\n marketing message can make or break a new product launch. Again, the cost of these activities should \nnot be underestimated.",
    "Page_15": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 15\nGaining health claim approval is currently one of the hardest steps in the process to\ncommercialising a novel functional food or ingredient. The regulatory processes differ across countries\nand jurisdictions, and the level of substantiation required for each target market may be quite different\n(Rowan et al., 2005; Arvanitoyannis and van Houwelingen-Koukaliaroglou2005). As the regulatory\nguidelines limit what can be claimed for a product, it is important to be aware of the constraints on\nmarketing messages before designing research trials to generate the clinical evidence. Again, the\ninnovation management process needs to be integrated across all the workstreams to be most efficient\nand effective.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBefore commercialising new functional food components, a number of scientific,\ntechnological, regulatory and marketing issues need to be addressed. There are many problems to\novercome to turn the discovery of a novel functional food component into a product that will deliver a\nclear health benefit to the consumer. Proof of concept is different at the different stages of the process,\n and is dependent to a large extent on the positioning of the final product, the market into which it will\nbe sold and the application. Nutrition marketing commentator Julian Mellentin (2005) points out that\nsuccessful brands are often more about packaging and marketing than about scientific breakthroughs\nand strong health claims — which are often not well understood by the consumer anyway. Above all,\nconsumers will not compromise on taste. Thus, to complement the scientists’ best efforts in terms of\ndiscovery, many factors other than excellence in technology and food science must be taken into\naccount to guarantee commercial success.\nREFERENCES\nAnon (2004), Global Market Review of Functional Foods -Forecasts to 2010.

DEO2\n'Food Group, Agricultural and Life Sciences, Lincoln University, Canterbury and 2Crop & Food\nResearch Ltd, Lincoln, Canterbury\nABSTRACT\nUlluco (Ullucus tuberosus) is a South American root crop that has recently been released in\nNew Zealand under the name Earth GemsTM. It contains high levels of carbohydrate, moderate levels\nof protein and very low levels of fat and so will be a valuable addition to the New Zealand diet. Ulluco\nare widely eaten in South American countries bordering the high Andes, where they are commonly\nused in stews in combination with other local vegetables and meat. Previous sensory evaluation trials in\nNew Zealand have confirmed the presence of a mild after-taste in locally grown tubers. In this research\ntwo different ulluco cultivars, principally red and yellow skinned, were grown in a glasshouse in three\ndifferent types of media; soil, potting mix and sand to determine whether the problem was genetic or\nrelated to the medium they were grown in. Thirty five panellists taste-tested the cooked ulluco and\nevaluated the two cultivars grown in the three different mediums. The evaluations comprised skin\ncolour, hardness of the flesh measured by biting the cooked tissue, waxiness, sweetness, bitterness, the\namount of earthy taste and overall acceptance. Statistical analysis of the taste preference data recorded\nunder standardised conditions by the 35 panellists showed that no statistical differences between the\nevaluation of the red and yellow colours or the evaluations of the different growth mediums could be\npreviously reported earthy flavour.\nINTRODUCTION\nUlluco (Ullucus tuberosus) is a tuber that is a staple food of people living in the high Andes of\nSouth America. As one of the “lost crops\" used by the Incas, it is still grown and eaten today, mainly\nby subsistence farmers, but is largely unknown outside the Andean region (Sperling and King, 1990).\nIn 1993, a number of ulluco cultivars were brought to New Zealand where they were quarantined to\nremove viruses. On release from quarantine a number of these colourful (magenta and yellow) and\nexotic looking (magenta spots on yellow and green spots on yellow) tubers have been grown at\nPukekohe, Feilding and Lincoln, in New Zealand, to find out the most preferred site for growing.\n In South America, ulluco are commonly used in stews in combination with other local\nvegetables and meat. Cooked ulluco tubers have been reported as having a smooth texture and a slight\nearthy taste (Pietila and Jokela, 1988) and others describe the flavour as mucilaginous and similar to\nokra (Sperling and King, 1990). Some cultivars contain mucilage which can be removed by soaking or\npreboiling before cooking (Arbizu and Tapia, 1997). This tuber contains high levels of carbohydrate,\nmoderate levels of protein and very low levels of fat (Busch and Savage, 2002). As such, they will be a\nvaluable addition to the New Zealand diet. Other tubers from South America such as potato (Solanum\ntuberosum), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) (called kumara in New Zealand) and oca (Oxalis tuberosa)\n(called yam in New Zealand) have been successfully grown in New Zealand and this suggests that\nulluco may also grow successfully in the right environment in New Zealand. Popenoe (1992) notes that\nulluco could enjoy profitable niches in supermarkets and health food stores.\nUluco have recently been released commercially in New Zealand and are sold under the name\nof Earth Gems \". Previous studies in New Zealand have confirmed the presence of a mild earthy after-\ntaste in some locally grown tubers (Busch et al., 20oo). This study compares ulluco grown in three\ndifferent growth media (soil, river sand and potting mix) in order to find out whether the taste problem\nis genetic or related to the growth medium.",
    "Page_17": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 17\nMATERIALSANDMETHODS\nFifteen accessions of ulluco (Ullucus tuberosus) were collected in Bolivia and Argentina\nduring 1993 as part of the biodiversity programme of the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and\nS n              \nProgramme). All accessions were examined for virus contamination at Crop & Food Research, Lincoln\nin May 1993 using herbaceous indicator hosts. All lines were found to be infected with several viruses.\nVirus elimination in five cultivars was carried out following the procedures of Fletcher et al., (1998).\nOne vigorously growing virus-free plant of each cultivar with no morphological differences from the\noriginally imported cultivars was released from quarantine in July 1998.\nTubers of five cultivars of ulluco (U2, U3, U9, U13 and U15) were all individually planted in\n8.5 litre pots on 3oth November 2004 at Lincoln, in a heated glasshouse with an average temperature of\n20°C. The skin colour of each cultivar was as follows: predominantly red- U2 and U15, and\npredominately yellow- U3 (with red spots), U9 and U13. Three media selected were soil, potting mix\nand sand. Each pot was filled up to about 4 cm below top with sand, soil or potting mix before\n  s  n     d    a    \nwere planted 3 cm deep in the middle of each pot. The trial was replicated five times and the pots were\nrandomly moved around twice during the growing season as to avoid any shade effect in the\nglasshouse. All the plots regularly received water and fertiliser to avoid stress to the plants. Slow\nrelease fertiliser (nitrogen-20%, phosphate-10%, potash-5%, calcium- 2.6%, sulphur-2.6%, iron-\n0.36%) by the trade name of Grotabs was applied at the rate of 5 g/plant on 2o\" December 2005.\nPlants were top dressed with Crop 20 (nitrogen-19.5%, potash-10%, sulphur-12.5%) at the rate of 5\ng/plant. Each individual pot was harvested separately on 25t July 2005. Tuber number and the total\nweight per pot were recorded. Due to the limited number of tubers from each pot, red and yellow\ncultivars were bulked separately according to the colour for the taste test.\nSensory Analysis\nCooking\n For each cultivar, 200 g of ulluco were added to 600 mL of tap water in a covered container\nwith a sealing lid. They were brought to the boil and then cooked for a further 15 minutes until tender.\n Samples were drained of water and allowed to cool to room temperature before use.\nPanellists and sensory procedures\nThe 35 panel members consisted of staff and students from Lincoln University. There were 15\nmales and 20 females, aged between 19 and 55. One piece of each sample was placed on identical\nwhite plates coded with a 2-digit random number (www. randomnumber.org) and served at room\ntemperature. Six different samples were presented to panellists in a random order. Panellists evaluated\nthe samples in individual white booths. Between each sample, panellists were encouraged to rinse their\nmouth out with water. Taste testing took place in the morning and afternoon of the same day.\nPanellists were asked to evaluate skin colour, texture, flavour and overall acceptability of the cooked\nulluco. Two types of scale, intensity and preference, were applied for rating either (a) the intensity of\nthe attributes, or (b) the preference for skin colour and overall acceptability (Meilgaard et al., 1987) A\n5 point scale with 1 = very soft and 5 = very hard, 1 = non-waxy and 5 = very waxy, 1 = not sweet at\nall and 5 = extremely sweet, 1 = no bitter taste and 5 = very strong bitter taste, was used to evaluate\nhedonic scale of 5 with 1 = dislike very much and 5 = like very much for skin and flesh colour and with\n 1 = like very much and 5= dislike very much for overall acceptability.\nRESULTS\nMean data for the sensory evaluation for each cultivar for each of the three treatments are\nshown in Table 1. Statistical analysis of the data showed that no significant differences between the\ngrowing mediums or the skin colour could be detected for any of the parameters assessed by the\npanellists. Overall, the panellists did observe “a slightly earthy taste” for all of the cultivars with no\nmarked difference between the red and yellow cultivars. The panellists gave an overall rating of “not\nvery sweet\"' and “slightly bitter” for both the red and yellow skinned cultivars.",

The red ulluco grown in soil and potting\nmix and the yellow grown in soil were ranked as hardest by the panellists. Overall, the yellow ulluco\nwere ranked lower for hardness that the red ulluco. For waxiness and sweetness the yellow ulluco were\nranked higher than the red ulluco. Both the red and yellow ulluco were ranked the same for bitterness,\nwith a mean of 1.7. The yellow ulluco grown in soil and the red ulluco grown in potting mix had the\nhighest ranking for earthy taste, while the yellow ulluco grown in potting mix and the red ulluco grown\nan earthy taste and gave a mean ranking of 2.4 (for yellow and red) that was between ‘slight earthy\ntaste’ and ‘moderate after taste'. There were no differences in taste between the two different skin\ncolours of the ulluco or the medium they were grown in. However, for overall acceptability (where the\nranking was opposite; 1 = like, etc to 5 = dislike, etc) the red skinned ulluco were ranked much lower\nthan the yellow ulluco, mean results were 1.9 and 3.2 respectively.\nDISCUSSION\n Growing the ulluco in different media appears to have little effect on the sensory evaluation\nresults. The most common comment made by the panellists was about liking the colour of the cooked\nulluco. Previous research has shown that ulluco still retained their colour after cooking (Busch and\nSavage, 20o0). Based on their answers to the preference to buy data (shown as skin colour in Table 1)\nthe panellists liked the red cultivars best, a similar result to previous studies (Busch et al., 2000). This\n may be as a result of the popularity of other red vegetables commonly available in New Zealand.\nInterestingly, studies in South America (Espinosa and Crissman, 1999 and Pietela and Jokela,\n1988) show that consumers preferred the yellow tubers. In New Zealand, there are few other yellow\ntubers that consumers are familiar with, although this situation is changing with the release of two new\ntypes of oca being released recently, Inca Gold by Crop & Food Research Ltd and another yellow oca\nsold by Halford's of Palmerston North. It would be interesting to undertake a repeat sensory analysis of\nulluco in five years or so to see if this preference changes.\n In South America ulluco are traditionally washed and/or soaked overnight in water before\ncooking to remove the mucilage present in some cultivars. The ulluco in this experiment were not\nsoaked to remove mucilage before cooking. The overall plan in this experiment was to reflect the most\nlikely way the tubers would be treated by New Zealand consumers. In fact, no mucilage exuded from\nthese particular ulluco when they were prepared for the sensory evaluation or, were any comments",
    "Page_19": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 19\nmade about the presence of mucilage by panellists. This is in contrast to previous studies in New\nZealand (Busch et al., 2000).\n In the absence of any media effect, as well as pursuing a possible genetic link for this\nproblem, it would be interesting to explore whether the perception of the earthy taste is idiosyncratic to\nthe panellist concerned. Other research has shown that some people are “tasters\"” or “non-tasters\"’ of\nparticular chemicals (Prescott et al., 2001). Previous authors have also reported that ulluco may\ncontain compounds such as saponins, which are known to have a bitter taste (Sperling and King, 1999).\nIn the meantime, it may be useful to suggest that ulluco should be soaked in water for a short period\nbefore cooking.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study shows that growing ulluco in different media has no effect on the taste descriptors\nmeasured, particularly the development of an earthy taste. Further research to see if there is a genetic\ncomponent in identifying an earthy taste by consumers and analysing ulluco to identify possible\ncompounds involved in the earthy taste would be useful. Overall, the panellists made positive\ncomments about the attractive colours of this vegetable, and this reinforces the comment made by other\nresearchers who called ulluco “underground rainbows\" (Flores et al., 2003).

RAVINDRAN\n Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University,\nPrivate Bag 11222, Palmerston North\nABSTRACT\n Diabetes mellitus and ‘syndrome X' are areas of immense health concerns. Both conditions\ncarry an appalling consequence of chronic macro- and micro-vascular complications. Currently there is\na resurgent interest in alternative anti-diabetic plants that has long history of usage to complement the\nconventional treatment therapies. In this context, the anti-diabetic properties of three such plants,\nnamely fenugreek (Trigonella foenum - graecum), bitter melon (Momordica charantia) and gurmar\n(Gymnema sylvestre) with most research evidence are reviewed.\nINTRODUCTION\nDiabetes mellitus is a serious endocrine disorder caused by the body's inability to produce any\nor enough insulin or by the ineffective use of the insulin produced (insulin resistance). This deficiency\nresults in increased concentrations of glucose in the blood called hyperglycaemia, which if not\ncontrolled damage many of the body's organs. Associated with insulin resistance is the collection of\nsymptoms known as Syndrome X or \"metabolic syndrome\" or ‘pre-diabetic syndrome’ (abdominal\nobesity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure and high normal blood\nsugar). Long-term complications of uncontrolled blood sugar include increased risk of heart disease,\nstroke, kidney disease, blindness and loss of nerve function. Regulating blood sugar for diabetics is\ntherefore crucial.\nThe first goal in therapy is to achieve and maintain an optimal fasting blood glucose level.\nLifestyle management (diet control, exercise and weight control, stress management), oral glucose-\nlowering drugs and injections of insulin are the conventional strategic treatment therapies for\nimproving glucose homeostasis. Food is the primary foundation for blood sugar control, often called\nglycaemic control. Eating foods that promote glycaemic balance is the key to a healthy diet, especially\nfor those with insulin resistance. Pharmacological treatment is resorted when glycaemic balance is not\nmaintained, but the benefit of medication on blood sugar control is often temporary. Insulin is usually\nadded to an oral agent when glycemic control is suboptimal at maximal doses of oral medications.\nAlthough insulin is a life-saver, it is not a cure-all. The majority of type 2 patients are sufficiently\ninsulin-resistant that even supra-normal insulin concentrations, are insufficient to control the\nhyperglycaemia. Weight gain, increased risk of atherogenesis and hypoglycaemia are common side\neffects of insulin therapy.\nUnfortunately, neither insulin injections nor oral ant diabetic drugs reinstate a normal pattern\nof glycaemic control, whether used alone or in combination. As an alternative approach, plants with\nanti-diabetic activities are increasingly sought by diabetic patients and health care professionals.\nAlthough there are thousands of botanicals with anti-diabetic claims, this review will discuss only three\nsuch plants (fenugreek, bitter melon and gurmar) with long history of therapeutic use, most research\nevidence, less side effects and potential for use as functional ingredients in low-glycaemic foods.\nKnowledge on these plants primarily comes from generations of experience and traditional medicine.\nFenugreek\nLeguminosae. Its seeds, inter alia is widely as a condiment in Asian dishes. It is used as a supplement\nin wheat and maize flour for bread making in India and Egypt, and also therapeutically as a lactation\n rs ( 8 ii 9i - se)  si m ud - u ss yh ns",

It also contains a polar, non-charged, free amino acid, 4-hydroxyisolysine (4-OH-Ile).\nThis amino acid is present only in plants, especially in Trigonella species.\nIn several clinical trials, fenugreek seeds have been found to lower glucose levels in both,\nhumans and animals, the effect is gradual and cumulative. It is reported to increase erythrocyte insulin\nreceptors and improve peripheral glucose utilization, thus showing potential pancreatic as well as\nextrapancreatic effects (Raguram et al., 1994). The hypoglycaemic effects have been attributed to\nseveral mechanisms. Sauvaire et al. (1998) demonstrated that 4-OH-Ile increased glucose-induced,\ndose-dependent insulin release through a direct effect on the isolated islets of Langerhans in both\nhumans and rats. The pattern of insulin secretion was described to be biphasic and it was hypothesised\nthat the mode of action was on the β-cells since the levels of somatostatin and glucagons produced by\nthe pancreatic α-cells were not altered. However carbon α- S- configuration, carbon  hydroxylation\nand full methylation are essential features required for insulinotropic activity of 4-OH-lle. It also had\nno interaction with other agonists of insulin secretion, such as leucine, arginine, tolbutamide and\nglyceraldehyde. Fenugreek is also reported to inhibit the activities of a-amylase and sucrase enzymes\ninvolved in carbohydrate digestion.\nA secondary mechanism for its hypoglycaemic action is via the fibre content. Fenugreek\ncontains 50% fibre (20% soluble fibre - mainly galactomannans) that can slow the rate of postprandial\nglucose absorption. Other chemical constituents that are believed to have hypoglycaemic activity\ninclude saponins (4.8%), many of which are glycosides of diosgenin, alkaloids such as trigonelline,\nchromium, a mineral that plays a role in the uptake of glucose by cells.\n In addition to restoring antioxidant balance in diabetes, fenugreek seeds are reported to be\neffective at lowering serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and the mechanism is\nattributed to saponins which increases biliary cholesterol excretion, leading to low cholesterol levels.\nSeed powder normalized the altered creatinine kinase activity in heart, liver and skeletal muscle of\ndiabetic rats to the values of control rats (Genet et al., 1999). It also normalized alteration in hepatic\nand renal glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity (Gupta et al., 1999). There is\nrn a o o  sd yn   o\nBitterMelon\nBitter melon or bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae. Its\ngeneral nutritional composition is similar to that of cucumber, but it contains several chemical\nconstituents, which are characteristic to bitter melon. The bitter principle, for which the fruit is named,\nis due to the alkaloid momordicine and charantin, and not cucurbitacins as in other members of the\nCucurbitaceae. Amongst the dazzling array of medical conditions (possible anti-tumour, anti-\nmutagenic, anti-viral and other activities) documented for bitter melon, its hypoglycaemic effect has\nreceived the most attention. The fruit is eaten as a vegetable, but as a treatment for diabetes, it is\ntypically the juice or an extract of the unripe fruit (50 to 200 mL per day) that is most effective. The\ndarker coloured, small varieties are more potent in being hypoglycaemic than the modern produce that\nhas been bred for less bitterness.\nA large body of research now confirms the hypoglycemic effects of bitter melon in animal\nmodels, both acutely and chronically. In separate studies, 73-86% of type 2 diabetic animals showed\nhypoglycaemic response to bitter melon juice (Ahmad et al., 1999; Wellihinda et al., 1986). Two\ncompounds, namely charantin, a mixture of steroidal glycosides and an insulin-like protein referred to\nas polypeptide-P or plant insulin, have been isolated from bitter melon and are believed to be\nresponsible for its hypoglycemic activity. It is believed that bitter melon acts on both the pancreas and\nnon-pancreatic cells, such as muscle cells. Bitter melon also contains the alkaloid mormordicine. Other\nproposed actions include extra-pancreatic activity, such as increased tissue glucose uptake, liver/muscle\nglycogen synthesis and, decreased blood glucose synthesis through depression of the enzymes glucose-\n6-phosphatase, fructose-1, and 6 bisphosphatase, and enhanced glucose oxidation by enzyme G6PDH\npathway.\nIn an investigation of M. charantia in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice, bitter melon not\nonly reduced plasma glucose levels, but also significantly reduced renal hypertrophy compared to\nuntreated diabetic controls (Grover et al., 2001). Bitter melon extracts were also able to reduce\noxidative stress and reverse the effects of chronic diabetes. Additionally, bitter melon extracts show",

More studies need to be conducted to confirm the efficacy of these extracts in\nhumans, although the generations of dietary use suggests that safety is unlikely to be an issue\nGurmar\nGymnema (Gymnema sylvestra) is a woody plant whose leaves have been used for centuries\nto treat diabetes. Chewing the leaves impairs a person's ability to discriminate sweet taste, hence it's\nname ^gurmar’ or ‘sugar destroyer’ (in Hindi). Gurmarin, a polypeptide of 35 amino acids is reported\nto be responsible for this sweetness inhibitory activity. Though one mechanism of action is by\nsuppressing the desire to eat sweet foods, the hypoglycaemic activity of gymnema is reported to reside\nprimarily in a group of compounds called gymnemic acids. They are a mixture of acid insoluble\ntriterpenoid saponins present in an aqueous ethanolic extract, GS4 of the leaves.\nGymnema extract GS4 has been reported to reduce hyperglycaemia in diabetic rats, rabbits\nand humans, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, increase serum insulin levels in vivo and in vitro, and\nincrease β-cell number in streptocin-induced diabetes. Fasting blood glucose levels as well as insulin\nrequirements were reported to be reduced in type 1 individuals, perhaps by increasing the utilization of\ninsulin (Shanmugasunderam et al., 1990). Significant reductions in blood glucose, glycosylated\ndiabetic patients after an oral treatment with 400 mg/day GS4 extract for 18-20 months. Five patients\ntotally discontinued conventional drug therapy and maintained glucose homeostasis entirely with this\nplant extract. In this study, lipids also decreased significantly. Patients on placebo had no significant\nchanges in HbA1c, FBG, or lipids. (Baskaran et al., 1990). In these studies, it was hypothesised that\nGS4 may stimulate β -cell function, increase β -cell number, and/or increase insulin release by\nincreasing cell permeability to insulin (Persaud et al., 1999). In pancreatectomised animals, it had no\nhypoglycaemic effect, indicating that its effect may require some residual β-cell function\n(Shanmugasundaram et al.,1990).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is a wider interest in the use of ‘natural’ dietary adjuncts as functional foods for\nmanagement of diseases. With syndrome X and diabetes, a low-risk, food-based intervention that can\nmodulate glucose homeostasis and potentially improve lipid parameters is desirable. In this respect, the\nwith natural fibre, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.

Some foods are now called functional foods, foods that are capable of providing\nadditional physiological benefits, such as preventing or delaying onset of chronic diseases, in addition\nto meeting basic nutritional requirements (Kaur and Kapoor, 2001). The antioxidant compounds\nd n  oq   p s a as  du s    \noxidation of lipids, proteins and genetic material at a cellular level (Basu, 1999). In addition to\nendogenous antioxidants synthesised by the body, the diet also supplies a significant amount of the\nantioxidants required by the body (Parke, 1999). Tomatoes have been identified as an important\nfunctional food as they contain a number of antioxidants, such as, carotenoids (especially lycopene),\nphenolics, and ascorbic acid (Abushita et al., 2000; Djuric and Powell, 2001; Martinez-Valverde et al.,\n2002). Because a significant amount of tomatoes and tomato products are consumed in the diet, they\nmake a valuable contribution to the supply of antioxidants required in the body. Regular consumption\nof tomatoes and processed tomato products has been related to a reduced risk of various chronic\n diseases such as cancers, especially prostate cancer (Basu, 1999; Giovannucci, 1999; Rao and Agarwal,\n1999; George et al., 2001) and coronary heart diseases (Arab et al., 2000; Bramley, 2000).\nAntioxidant components of tomatoes\nTomato fruit contains a wide range of antioxidant molecules, such as carotenoids, flavonoids,\nphenolic acids and ascorbic acid (Giovanelli et al., 1999; Raffo et al., 2002; George et al., 2004). The\nantioxidant compounds help scavenge free radicals and, thus, prevent abnormal oxidative changes in\nthe human body. Free radicals can be formed spontaneously in the body by many biological processes\nand their production may increase as a result of environmental sources such as cigarette smoke, UV\nradiation and oxidizing agents (Scheffler et al., 1992). Excessive accumulation of these pro-oxidants\nand free radicals may damage cells by the oxidation of lipids, proteins and DNA, and induce\n   d  e    -s   \nradicals in the body, antioxidant compounds which inhibit oxidation should be present (Basu, 1999).\nApart from the various endogenous antioxidants synthesized in the body, such as catalase, glutathione\nperoxidase and transferrin (Halliwell, 1996), the diet also makes an important contribution to the levels\nof antioxidants required in the body (Heber, 2000; Leonardi et al., 2000; Martinez-Valverde et al.,\n2002). Tomatoes and tomato-based products account for more than 85% of the dietary intake of\nlycopene in the USA (Rao and Agarwal, 1999). Fresh tomatoes account for 51% of the total daily\ndietary lycopene intake, with the rest coming from processed products (Rao and Agarwal, 2000).\n Studies have shown that lycopene is a powerful antioxidant in vitro (Di Mascio et al., 1989)\nand numerous investigations have revealed possible links between tomato consumption and a\ndecreased risk of certain cancers, in particular prostate and lung cancers (reviewed by Giovannucci,\n1999). It is thought that the free radical scavenging ability of lycopene is one of the mechanisms\n responsible for its beneficial properties. Sharoni et al. (2000) reviewed the molecular mechanisms for\nthe anti-cancer role of lycopene. At a cellular level, lycopene interferes with the mitogenic pathway of\nIGF-1 levels and slowed cell cycle progression. However, it has been observed that the anti-cancer\neffects of lycopene, together with other micronutrients like a-tocopherol, lipoic acid and curcumin,\nwere much greater than lycopene alone (Liu et al., 1997; Pastori et al., 1998; Amir et al., 1999).\nLycopene also increased gap-junction communication between cells and induced the synthesis of\nconnexin-43 (Shi and Le Maguer, 2000). Loss of gap-junction communication may be important for\nmalignant transformation, and its restoration may reverse the malignant process (Shi and Le Maguer,\n2000).\nLycopene content of tomatoes\nCarotenoids are only one of the antioxidants found in tomatoes but they are considered to be\nthe most important. Tomatoes contain more than 21 carotenoids, including lycopene, phytoene,\nphytofluene, neurosporene, α-, β-, Y-, 8- and -carotene and lutein (Shi and Le Maguer, 2000).",
    "Page_25": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005,Vol. 3025\nLycopene is the most abundant carotenoid present in ripe red tomatoes, comprising up to 90% of the\npigments present. Lycopene from natural plant sources exists, predominantly, in an all-trans\nconfiguration, which is the most thermodynamically stable form (Nguyen and Schwartz, 1999).\nAlthough different varieties of tomatoes contain varying levels of lycopene the average level\nranges from 1.6-11 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW) (Kerkhofs et al., 2003) (Table 1). Lycopene is\nconcentrated in the layer of 4-5 cells under the thin cuticle of the tomato (most often, the skin plus the\nnext 4-5 layers of cells are referred to as the skin), which contains little lycopene (Davies & Hobson,\n1981). Darker coloured varieties of tomatoes tend to contain higher levels of lycopene than paler\nvarieties (Shi and Le Maguer, 2000). Smaller sized varieties, for example cherry and cocktail\ntomatoes, generally contain higher levels of lycopene (Leonardi et al., 2002; Raffo et al., 2002; see\nTable 1). Conversely, larger tomatoes usually contain lower levels of lycopene (Shi and Le Maguer,\n(    g    )  o    sn  \nand have β-carotene as the major carotenoid.\nTable 1: Lycopene concentration of fresh tomatoes (Kerkhofs et al., 2003).\nTotal lycopene (mg/100 g FW)\nReference\n1.6-5.6\nHart and Scott (1995)\n1.8- 6.5\nMartinez-Valverde et al., (2002)\n3.1-7.7\nNguyen and Schwartz (1999)\n5.2-8.5\nAbushita et al., (2000)\n5.8\nKozukue and Friedman (2003)\n4.6, 6.8\nLavelli et al., (2000)\n10.4\nRaffo et al., (2002)\n10.8\nLeonardi et al., (2000)\n2.0-3.9\nMolyneux et al., (2004)a\n2.5,3.7\nSahlin et al., (2004)a\n2.2-2.7\nKerkhofs (2003)a\n* New Zealand data\nIn processed tomato products, all-trans lycopene accounts for 90-98% of the total lycopene\npresent and very small amounts of cis-lycopene have been detected (Bohm et al., 2002).\nHealth benefits of tomato and tomato products\n Antioxidant functions of lycopene, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic acid are associated with\nlipids, and other cell components in vitro (Shi and Le Maguer, 2000). Many tissue culture studies and\nanimal studies have also shown that lycopene helps to inhibit tumour formation (Rao and Agarwal,\n1999). The interest in tomato antioxidants and their potential protective role in prevention of chronic\ndiseases stems largely from the epidemiological observations on normal and at risk populations (Rao\nand Agarwal, 1999). Many epidemiological studies have suggested that a diet rich in a variety of fruits\nand vegetables results in a lower risk of cancer and other chronic diseases (Steinmetz and Potter, 1996;\nWorld Cancer Research Fund, 1997). Epidemiological investigations to study the role of tomatoes and\ntomato products in relation to chronic diseases have found a reduction in risk of various cancers and\nischaemic heart diseases. Some of the major studies have been summarized in Table 2 (Rao and\nAgarwal, 1999). Based on consumption of more than 10 servings of tomato products per week, an\nalmost 35% reduction in risk of prostate cancer has been observed, and the protective effect was even\nstronger, when the analysis focused on more advanced or aggressive prostate cancer (Giovannucci,\n1999).",

Most research studying\nthe antioxidant components in tomatoes has been carried out overseas and there is limited data\n concerning the antioxidant composition of tomatoes grown in New Zealand except for the studies\ncarried out by Molyneux et al., (2004) and Kerkhofs et al., (2005). A number of factors- varietal,\nagronomic and environmental have been reported to influence the resulting antioxidant composition of\ntomatoes (McCollum, 1954; Bajaj et al., 1990; Buta and Spaulding, 1997; Abushita et al., 2000;\nDumas et al., 2003). In order to improve the level of antioxidants in tomatoes and their processed\n products, it is important to understand how different factors, ranging from growing to processing, could\ninfluence their levels.\n In some earlier studies, tomatoes have been obtained from consumer markets without any\ncontrol or information about the growing conditions (Vinson et al. 1998; Crozier et al., 1997; Stewart\net al., 2000; Martinez-Valverde et al., 2002) while, in other studies, the cultivars were harvested at\ndifferent stages of maturity (Leonardi et al., 2000); therefore, it is not possible to directly compare\nthese results. To make a valid comparison of the effect of cultivar, there is a need to study the\nantioxidant composition of tomatoes grown under identical conditions and harvested at the same stage\nof maturity. It is known that the growing conditions (e.g. field vs. greenhouse) and stage of maturity\nplay an important role in determining the level of antioxidant components (Abushita et al., 2ooo; Arias\net al., 2000a; Gomez et al., 2001). Because exposure to higher light intensity field grown tomatoes\n greenhouse grown tomatoes (Herrmann, 1976; Abushita et al., 2000; Shi and Le Maguer, 2000; Gomez\net al., 2001). A more than 20-fold increase in lycopene content of tomatoes occurs between the green\nstage and the red-ripe stage of maturity (Gomez et al., 2001; Raffo et al., 2002). Molyneux et al.,\n(2004) noted that the lycopene content of different cultivars of greenhouse grown tomatoes ranged\nfrom 1.7 to 4.2 mg/100 g even though they were grown under similar conditions. Overall, the lycopene\ncontent of the five different cultivars investigated increased by 34% after only 5 days storage at 15°℃.\nEnvironmental factors such as solar radiation can also influence the antioxidant components\n       n   o   n  n \nlycopene in tomatoes (Hamner et al., 1945; McCollum, 1954; Davey et al., 2000).

Overall, there appears to be an\nincrease in lycopene content in two of the cultivars studied (Tradiro and Flavourine) while the levels in\nthe cultivar Excell remained relatively constant. All of the tomatoes were harvested at the same level of\nfield grown tomatoes. The light conditions, i.e. the amount of solar radiation received inside the\ngreenhouse may vary at different times of the year, as occurs in the field which, in turn, could play an\nimportant role in determining the levels of antioxidants in tomatoes produced at different times of the\nyear, and this requires further investigation.\n Fertiliser treatments of the growing plants are also of importance, however, the data available\non the effects of fertilisers on the antioxidant components of tomato is limited (Dumas et al., 2003).\n Application of greater amounts of potassium than usual has been reported to increase the synthesis of\nlycopene in tomatoes, however the rates of potassium applied in studies were very high and not\nconsistent with modern agricultural practices (Dumas et al., 2003). Both organic and synthetic\nfertilisers can be used for growing tomatoes. In New Zealand, organic farming is being considered as\nan alternative to conventional farming, which uses synthetic fertilisers, pesticides and growth\nregulators. The use of organic fertilisers like vermicompost has been reported to increase the amount of\nascorbic acid content in tomato (Premuzic et al., 1998), but their influence on other antioxidant\ncomponents has not been widely studied. Toor et al., (2006) showed that growing greenhouse tomatoes\norganically using either chicken manure or a grass-clover mulch led to a reduction in yield of tomatoes.\nThe lycopene content of the tomatoes grown on chicken manure was comparable to the inorganic\nfertiliser treatments. However, the lycopene contents of the tomatoes grown on a grass-mulch were\nvery much lower than all the other treatments. Toor et al., (2006) suggest that this might have been\n         s     n   \nbiosynthesis of lycopene in tomatoes.\n Studies have demonstrated that fruits accumulate higher levels of phenolic compounds in the\nskin as their protection mechanism against ultraviolet radiation, to act as attractants in fruit dispersal,\nand as defence chemicals against pathogens and predators (Strack, 1997). Tomato skin has been\nreported to contain higher levels of lycopene and flavonoids than pulp (Al-Wandawi et al., 1985;\n      ‘1 1 5  ‘ 1  61    1s\ntomatoes are often discarded during cooking or commercial processing. Toor and Savage (2005)\nshowed that the skin of greenhouse grown tomatoes contained significantly larger amounts of lycopene\ncompared to the pulp and the seeds.\ninfluence the antioxidant composition of tomatoes. Storage of tomatoes, and other products of tropical\nor subtropical origin, at below critical but non-freezing temperatures (up to 12°C), predisposes them to\nchilling injury (Grierson and Kader, 1986; Efiuvwevwere and Thorne, 1988; Yanuriati et al., 1999). In\naddition, storage of tomatoes at 22°C for 14 days resulted in an increase in antioxidant components\nsuch as lycopene due to an increased rate of conversion of chloroplasts into chromoplasts, whereas,\nstorage at 4°C produced no significant changes in lycopene content (Ajlouni et al., 2001). However,\nthere is limited research about the effect of storage temperature and time on the other antioxidant\ncomponents of fresh tomato. Processing of tomatoes can also affect their antioxidant components. For\nexample, frying of tomatoes and treatment with oil and vinegar mixture has been reported to cause a\nsignificant reduction in the ascorbic acid, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of tomatoes\n(Sahlin et al., 2004). Takeoka et al. (2001) observed an 82% decrease in ascorbic acid, and a 9 to 28%\n decrease in lycopene content during processing of tomatoes into tomato paste. Fresh tomatoes are\nusually dried, using high temperatures, into different forms such as halves, slices, quarters and powders\nand are used as a component for pizza and various vegetable dishes (Giovanelli et al., 2002). Drying of\ntomatoes at high temperature has been reported to cause considerable losses of ascorbic acid, and\nbrowning (Zanoni et al., 1999; Dewanto et al., 2002; Giovanelli et al., 2002). Zanoni et al. (1999)\nproposed that use of low temperature for drying and production of an intermediate moisture product\ncan help to reduce the oxidative damage in the final product. Kerkhofs et al., (2005) suggest that\ndrying tomatoes above 60°C will lead to significant losses of lycopene in the dried product. Their\nstudies showed that drying at 42°C yielded a product appeared to contain 33% more extractable\nlycopene than the original fresh product. Kerkhofs et al., (2005) suggest that the early part of the\ndrying process, which lasted two days, was more like a slow gentile cooking process which allowed",
    "Page_28": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 28\nmore lycopene to be released from the tomato matrix. The final colour of the dried product was bright\nred suggesting that no appreciable oxidation had taken place during drying.\nAnother important factor that can influence the biological activity of antioxidants is\nbioavailability, the degree to which antioxidants are released from the food matrix and absorbed by the\n  n   no   no    ss  o \navailable to the body through absorption for utilization in normal physiological functions (Shi and Le\nMaguer, 2ooo) and these are conducted by measuring the concentrations of nutrients in plasma and\nurine after ingestion of either pure compounds or foodstuffs of interest (Scalbert and Williamson,\n2000). Several researchers (Gartner et al., 1997; Pateau et al., 1998; Porrini et al., 1998; Pellegrini et\nal., 20oo) have noted an increase in the lycopene concentrations in plasma after ingestion of tomato\npuree, tomato paste and tomato juice, but not after ingestion of fresh tomatoes (Gartner et al., 1997;\nBohm and Bitsch, 1999). Studying bioavailability using animals and humans is time consuming and\ncostly. Therefore, in vitro digestion model is an alternative method, which simulates the conditions of\nhuman digestive tract and can be used to determine the amount of antioxidants that are released from\net al., (2006) confirm that the amount of lycopene released during an in vitro digestion of three\ndifferent cultivars of fresh tomato was very low (mean 3.8%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nFoods that provide health benefits in addition to their nutritive value, or that have a role in\nhave been identified as important functional foods because they contain various antioxidant\ncomponents such as carotenoids, mainly lycopene, phenolics and ascorbic acid. The regular\nconsumption of tomatoes has been associated with reduced risk from various forms of cancer and heart\ndiseases. The challenge for the future is to find a way to concentrate tomatoes so that it is possible to\nconsume sufficient lycopene to meet the daily requirement to lower the risk of various chronic diseases\nsuch as cancers, especially, prostate cancer and coronary heart disease.\nREFERENCES\nAbushita, A.

PINNAMANENI l, 2, C.S.BRENNAN,and G. NILS-ASP 2\n1 Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand\n2 Department of Food Technology, Engineering and Nutrition, Division of Applied Nutrition and Food\nChemistry, Lund University/Lund Institute of Technology, Lund, Sweden\nABSTRACT\nThe effects of inulin (Inulin TEX and Inulin HD), together with sucrose ester (SP 50 and SP\n70), inclusions on Reducing sugar release (RSR) were studied. RSR values from in vitro degradation\nstudies showed a decrease in starch digestion and the release of reducing sugars following the inclusion\nof inulin, sucrose esters and a combination of inulin and sucrose esters. Increased concentration of\ninulin TEX reduced RSR levels after 40 min of the digestion where as inulin HD did not show this\npattern. Combinations of inulin fibre (TEX, HD) with sucrose ester (SP50, SP70) were not significantly\ndifferent to breads with inulin fibres only. Inclusion of sucrose esters alone had a significant impact on\nreducing RSR levels when compared to control. This indicates a potential nutritional benefit of inulin\nenhanced breads.\nINTRODUCTION\nEver since the early description of dietary fibre by Trowel in 1974, the terminology and\ndefinition of dietary fibre has been debated. The most recent definition regarding dietary fibre classifies\nit as a remnant of edible plant cell polysaccharides and associated substances resistant to hydrolysis by\nhuman alimentary enzymes (Cherbut et al., 2002; Trowel and Burkitt, 1986). Significantly, this\ndefinition includes undigestible material such as oligosaccharides, (for instance inulin) which have\n1996). Research has also indicated these oligosaccharides may influence the digestion process in the\nupper intestine, and affect transit and stool output as well as integrity of the mucosal barrier in large\nintestine (Brennan et al., 2004).\nadd fibre to food products, and also as a sweetener. Unlike other fibres, inulin generally has no “off\nflavours\"’ and is highly soluble, hence reducing the negative effects of other viscous non-starch\npolysaccharides used in the food industry.\nChain length, distribution of the chains, and how the inulin chain is branched, all have a\nsignificant influence on the behaviour of the inulin ingredient. Simplistically, short chain inulin\nmolecules show a different technological behaviour than long chain inulin molecules. Thus, long chain\nInulin molecules are able to bind water and even form weak particle gels, whereas short chain Inulin\n molecules do not exhibit these properties.\n The importance of dietary fibre in relation to obesity, diabetes and other chronic illnesses has\nbeen subject to much scrutiny recently. Recommendations of the food pyramid consumption for dietary\nfibre range from 25 to 30 g/day, and the Food and Drug Administration has set the daily reference\nvalues to 25 g for labelling purposes (Park et al., 1997). This has prompted efforts by the food industry\nto add dietary fibre into various food products.\nBread has been targeted as an important food item to enrich with fibre, and has been the focus\nof attention by the industry and researchers in trying to incorporate higher levels of dietary fibres\n(Symons and Brennan 2004; Brennan 2005). However the main problem of dietary fibre addition in\nbaking is the important reduction of loaf volume and the different texture of the breads obtained which",
    "Page_33": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 3033\nhas been reported previously (Pomeranz et al., 1977). Some evidence suggests that the use of food\nemulsifiers (such as sucrose esters) can mitigate these responses (Sangnark and Noomhorm, 2004).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCommercial high-grade wheat flour (Elfin High Grade, Goodman Fielder, Auckland New\nZealand) was used for the base doughs. This flour contained approximately 76.8 g CHO; 1 g sugar; 3.5\ng dietary fibre (according to manufactures specifications). Inulin TEX and HD were obtained from\nSuiker Unie & Sensus (Dinteloord, The Netherlands). The sucrose esters (SP 50, SP 70) were obtained\nfrom Sisterna.\nBread dough was made according to the straight dough / bread making method (AACC 1995).\nIngredients for the doughs are detailed in Table 1. Doughs were divided into 70g portions and baked in\ntest-tins (pan height 60 mm; dimensions 150 mm length by 50 mm width top; and 140 mm length by 40\nmm width bottom). Doughs were baked at 220C for 20 minutes and allowed to cool for bread analysis.\nEight loaves were made per batch, and triplicate batches were produced.\nIn order to investigate the relative contributions of type of Inulin (Inulin TEX, Inulin HD), and\ntype of sucrose ester (SP50, SP70) and to determine their optimum level, an experimental design was\ncarried out. Each Inulin (TEX, HD) was used at two concentrations 5 and 10%, and each emulsifier\n(SP50, SP70) was used at 1% (all % are on flour bases wet basis).\nIn Vitro Analysis\nDigestion of bread samples were conducted using the in vitro starch digestion process of\nSymons and Brennan (2004) involving digestion of the bread samples in protease and amylase\nenzymatic solutions. The production of reducing sugars was assessed by the DNS method (as used by\nSymons and Brennan, 2004) and the results are reported as reducing sugars released on a starch basis.\nSamples are crushed to a size of 1 cm ', placed in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9), reduced to pH 1.5\n(with 8M HCL), and digested with 5 mL porcine pepsin and allowed to digest for 30 mins at 37°c.\nThen the pH was adjusted to 6.9 ( with 10 % NaOH), and the volume of the liquid made up to 50 mL\nwith sodium phosphate buffer to which porcine pancreatic α amylase had been added. The mixture was\ntransferred to dialysis tubing and placed in 450 mL of sodium phosphate buffer for 5 h. Duplicate\naliquots (1 mL) of dialysate were taken every 30 min and analysed for total sugars by the 3, 5-\ndinitrosalicylic acid(DNS) method. Reducing sugars released (RSR) were expressed in maltose\nequivalents as a total available carbohydrates present in the sample using following calculation.\nAsamplex500x0.95/ A maltose X SS x 100= RSR.\nWhere A sample is the value of absorbance at 540 nm; A maltose is the value of absorbance\n of a solution containing 1 mg of pure maltose per mL/ phosphate buffer; SS is the amount of starch\nplus sugars( in milligrams) contained within the sample; 500 is the total volume; and 0.95 is the\nconversion from maltose to starch.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe data collected from all experiments were calculated as means ± S.D. All determinations\nwere made, unless otherwise stated, in triplicate. Analyses of variance of the results (ANOVA) were\nperformed using the Minitab 14 statistical software package. Significance was defined as P< 0.05.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe effect of fibre and ester inclusion on starch degradation is illustrated in Figure 1 (a-d). It\nis of interest to note that the time O determination of RSR from the bread samples is higher in the fibre\nand ester adulterated samples than the control. This may in part be due to reducing sugars present\ninulin samples, although the effect observed with the addition of the sugar esters is unexpected and has\nnot been reported previously. However, inulin, sugar ester, and the combination of inulin and sugar",
    "Page_34": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 34\nester addition to the breads resulted in a decrease in overall sugar release following digestion (on a\ncomparative starch basis). This indicates that starch degradation and sugar release during the in vitro\nprocess is reduced compared to the control samples.\nAddition of Inulin Tex (Figure la) to the breads appeared to have a greater effect in the\nreduction of sugar release compared to the Inulin HD additions (Figure 1b). This is especially evident\nfor the 10 % addition of Inulin Tex. When the sugar esters were also included in these breads, the RSR\nlevels were similar to the samples without sugar esters. This indicates that there is little potential\nbenefit, in terms of lowering sugar release, by adding a combination of sugar esters and Inulin. In all\nsamples there seemed to be a peak in starch digestion between 80-120 minutes.\n Inclusion of the sugar esters themselves (at a 1% level) appeared to elicit a similar RSR\np s se issod si n sn ( pun s I sn) unu o go u oi pu s s se uonp\nof starch degradation of breads may be regulated by either the inclusion of fibre components, or sugar\nesters. The decision to use a particular source could be made on economic basis. However it should be\n  se aa aa ou  snp   o ss rns no    p i \nloaf volumes of the resulting breads.\n Previous research by Jenkins et al., (1981) has demonstrated the potential uses of non-starch\npolysaccharides as modulators of the glycaemic response to bread intake. Several researchers have\nattempted to determine the mechanisms in which this is achieved (Brennan et al., 1996; Brighenti et\nal., 1995; Schweizer et al., 1988). It is unlikely that the mode of action of the inulin was as a result of\nviscosity altering abilities of the inulin enriched doughs as inulin is a relatively short chained molecule\nwhich does not significantly alter the viscosity of systems through gelling properties. However it is\npossible that the inulin formed some competition with the starch and the protein within the system for\nthe limited amount of water, and that this competition for water availability resulted in the reduction of\nstarch degradation.\nCONCLUSION\nThe addition of inulin TEX and HD reduced RSR levels effectively when compared to control\nbread. The increase in the concentration of inulin TEX had shown to reduce RSR levels after 40\nminutes of the digestion where as inulin HD did not reduce RSR levels effectively upon increase in the\nconcentration. The combinations of inulin fibres (TEX, HD) with sucrose esters (SP50, SP70) were not\neffectively reduced RSR levels when compared to breads with inulin fibres only. Interestingly\ninclusion of sucrose esters alone had large impact on reducing RSR values when compared to the\ncontrol.\nSucrose ester SP50 had decreased RSR values by 72.5 % at the end of the digestion\ncomparing to that of 63.9% by Sucrose ester SP70. From the graphs it was observed that RSR values\nwere going down during the last 60 minutes of the incubation in the breads with inulin and sucrose\nester. The reason might be due to the above variability's and also when looked at carefully after 160\nmin sampling time, in most of the samples there did not appear to be statistically differences between\nthe samples. This will show a slowing down of starch digestion over incubation time, which would be\nexpected.",

CONNOR and L.P. VANHANEN\nFood Group, Agricultural and Life Sciences, Lincoln University, Canterbury\nABSTRACT\nHazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.) are a very recent addition to commercial horticulture in New\nZealand and Whiteheart has been selected as the primary commercial cultivar. No published\ninformation is available on the optimum temperatures needed to roast the dried nuts. An experiment\nusing a conveyer type roasting oven set at 20o°C. The roasted samples were then analysed for\nproximate contents and evaluated using a taste panel. The appearance, texture, flavour and overall\nappearance was evaluated by 63 tasters at one time. The blanched nut was appreciated for its colour but\nit was considered too chewy and bland in taste compared to the roasted nuts. Each one of the heat\ntreatments gave an improved rating for all of the attributes measured. Roasting in the oven set at\n200°C for 6 minutes (full roast) was the treatment appreciated most by all tasters. Analysis of the\ncorrelation coefficients showed that the overriding impression about the hazelnuts comes from the\nflavour of the nut followed by its texture. The overall appearance of the nut was not highly rated by the\ntasters once the hazelnuts had been heat treated.\nINTRODUCTION\nHazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.) are widely used as a luxury food especially when incorporated\ninto chocolate confectionary and muesli products. The taste and flavour of hazelnuts is due to the\noccurrence of several compounds whose presence affects both quality and nutritional value. However,\nthe beneficial characteristics of hazelnuts and hazelnut oil should not be overlooked.\nHazelnuts are a very recent addition to commercial horticulture in New Zealand. Many blocks\nof trees have been planted in the last 10 years and crops and more than 40 tonnes/annum have been\n   u d n s  d  a    n \nwork is to discover the form in which hazelnuts are most preferred to be eaten. This research is\nconcerned with evaluating various levels of roasting of hazels from no roasting to well roasted.\nThere appears to be no published papers on the sensory evaluation of the different levels of\nroasting of hazelnuts. In the paper “New hazelnuts selections for direct consumption\" Valentini et al.,\n(2001), different hybrids were compared to find the most favoured raw nuts and the most favoured\nroasted nuts. They were rated on degree of liking alone. In another study McNeil et al., (1994),\ncompared consumer preferences of 22 walnut cultivars. These were compared for taste, aftertaste,\n  ug p  o) ‘i na 1z q s e  ssms  s \nhazelnuts were compared by morphological and sensory analysis. Using a taste panel the Lansing 35\n       n n  n  s ns   \noverall result for the roasted kernel. The intensity of its sweetness and overall intensity of aroma was\nthe best features of Tonda Geentil identified in the taste test. Sinesio and Moneta (1997) carried out a\nsensory evaluation of walnuts by geographical region. The seven trained and experience panellists\nassessed the nuts for external appearance, taste and flavour and oral texture. Only one study involved\nroasted hazelnuts and this did not compare levels of roasting. There is also a need to evaluate the New\nZealand variety Whiteheart as it is a recent selection.\nMETHODS\nTreatments\nTwenty kg of hazelnuts (Corylus avellana L. cv Whiteheart) were harvested from a Canterbury\norchard in June 2001. The nuts were dried and stored in their shell at ambient temperatures until the\n Cracker and the kernels were stored in a sealed plastic bag in a fridge at 4°C until roasting commenced\nin June 2002.\nSome initial experiments took place to identify the temperature/time characteristics of an\nelectric high-intensity infrared conveyer oven (Lincoln Impinger 1300, Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA). In\n the final experiment the oven was set at 200°C and the degree of roasting was determined by the speed",
    "Page_38": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 38\nof the conveyer. 20o°C was chosen because temperatures in excess of this scorched the outside of the\n nuts. Three speed settings were chosen to correspond to the three levels of required roasting:\nBlanched - conveyer set to 1.75 min setting\nLight roast - conveyer set to 5 min setting\n Full roast - conveyer set to 6 min setting\nThe nuts were roasted the day before the sensory evaluation took place and the roasted nuts\nwere put in sealed containers and stored overnight at 4°C. The kernels were placed in an oven for 16\nhours at 105°C to determine their dry matter content (AOAC, 2002).\nTaste tests\nA sensory evaluation environment was set up with white booths and four small plastic\ncontainers to hold each of the four test samples (raw hazelnuts compared with the three levels of\n s n n   s   n   s  n   n n \nnuts as they wished from each treatment then to fill in the evaluation of that nut before moving to the\nnext sample.\nThe first part of the questionnaire contained questions on factors, which were identified as\npotentially having an effect on each tasters decision-taking. The factors collected were gender, age,\nsmoker/non-smoker, coffee and tea intake, nationality and previous hazelnut eating experience. For the\ntasting section a response on a 9-point Hedonic scale was requested (ranging from like extremely, like\nvery much, like moderately, like slightly, neither like nor dislike, dislike slightly, dislike moderately,\ndislike very much, dislike extremely). This scale was applied to the four nut atributes, namely\n    s a ss  ss     \nappropriate box. The nuts were sampled in a random order and the volunteers were given no\nabout attribute for each of the treatments. A summary of these comments is shown in Table 2.\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic information of each of the 63 tasters and their responses for each attribute on the\nraw and three roasting treatments were recorded and the data from the taste tests were analysed using\nthe GLM procedure (analysis of variance) in SAS V8.2 to determine differences between each\ntreatment. The taster was included as a blocking factor. The factor was not significant for all but the\ntexture result. The Bonferroni (Dunn) t-test at α = 0.05 was used to calculate the LSD.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe 1.75 min conveyer setting supplied just enough heat to allow the pellicle to be removed\nfrom the raw hazelnuts. A 5 minute conveyer setting changed the nuts to a light brown colour and\nproduced a crisper texture in the nuts. Six minutes of cooking caused the nuts to brown further;\ncooking beyond 6 minutes caused the hazelnuts to begin to burn. The moisture level of the raw nuts\nwas 4.5% and after roasting for 6 minutes the level dropped to 1.5%.\nTable 1: Taste test values for each attribute at each level of roasting, (mean ± S.E.),\nTreatment\nTexture\nFlavour\n Overall impression\nAppearance\nRaw\n6.0b ± 0.21\n5.4 c± 0.22\n5.8 c ± 0.26\n5.7 c ±0.24\nBlanch\n6.1 b ± 0.19\n6.4b± 0.18\n6.2 bc ± 0.22\n6.3 bc ± 0.18\nRoast 5 minutes\n6.5 ab ± 0.18\n7.0 ab ± 0.15\n6.7 ab ± 0.18\n6.6 ab ± 0.18\nRoast 6 minutes 6.9 a ± 0.20\n7.5a± 0.14\n7.1a ± 0.23\n7.2a ±0.20\np=\n0.005\n<0.001\n0.001\n<0.0001\nDifferent letters within each attribute indicate significant differences between treatments (Bonferroni t-\ntest at α = 0.05)..\nThe results in this table show a remarkably consistent pattern.

Again, the comments\ngive a clear picture. They also give a rationale for the consumer preferences. A raw hazelnut is\ngenerally not liked as much as a roasted hazelnut.

A common comment was the bitterness of the skin and the difficulty in\nchewing it.\nThe blanched nut was appreciated for its white colour but was considered too chewy and bland.\na n   i n     r s n  e n   \nnuts received similar comments. The full 6-minute roasted nuts were more appreciated for each\nattribute except for its overall impression. It is unclear why more tasters commented positively on the\n light roast than the full roast in this category, though many of those who did comment on the full roast\nsaid they were the best tasting nuts.

The only GGE found to be significantly different by the CGMS? and capillary blood sampling\nmethods was the mixed grain bread, with a GGE of 17.2 by the capillary method and a GGE of 7.8 by\nthe CGMS? method. Individuals were ranked differently by the CGMS? and capillary method for\nthree of the eight foods. Additionally, there was significantly more variability in the ranking of foods\n o     p s  n g  n  s n n \nsampling method. This study suggests that, at this stage, the CGMS? shows too much variability to\nreplace capillary blood sampling as a method of determining blood glucose response of foods in normal\nindividuals.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe ability of foods to raise blood glucose levels in individuals is estimated by measuring\nindividuals’ blood glucose responses to consumption of a food from fasting for 2-3 hours. Glycaemic\nGlucose Equivalents (GGE) represents a food's effect on blood glucose in terms of the weight of\nglucose an individual would need to eat to produce the same effect as the food (Monro, 2002). Blood\nsamples are often collected using capillary blood sampling. Capillary blood sampling results in a large\nnumber of finger pricks to participants over a short period of time (eight in two hours) and can\ntherefore be painful. The method also limits the length of time foods can be followed and makes it\ndifficult to study the blood glucose profile of food and meals over the whole day.\nAn alternative to capillary blood sampling for determining the blood glucose response of\nfoods may be the Minimed? Continuous Glucose Monitoring? System Gold TM (CGMS?). This\nmonitors glucose values in the interstitial tissue fluid. The monitor records an average glucose value\nevery five minutes. The CGMS? has been used in a number of clinical trials and the correlation\nbetween blood glucose measurement and the CGMS? has been reported to be high (0.8-0.9) (Gross &\nMastrototaro, 20oo). However, when glucose values are changing rapidly, there may be a lag between\nblood and interstitial fluid measurements (Rebrin et al., 1999). Since measurements of blood glucose\nresponse to foods are based on the area under the curve of blood glucose response following\nof the response.\nThe present study examined whether capillary and CGMS? methods estimated the same GGE\nvalues for foods with a range of GGE values. If the CGMS? could be used to determine the blood\nglucose response of foods, it would replace the need for continual blood sampling.",

The\naverage age (± s.d.) of participants was 42.8 ± 18.7 years; their average BMI was 25.8 ± 6.3 kg/m; and\nthe average fasting capillary glucose was 4.9 ± 0.4 mmol/L. This study was approved by the\nCanterbury Ethical Committee and all participants gave their informed consent.\nParticipants came into the Lipid and Diabetes Research Centre late one afternoon in order to\nhave the Minimed? CGMS? fitted. The CGMS? monitor was fitted on the back of each participants\nhip area. The CGMS@ was worn for up to 72 hours continuously. After wearing the CGMS? for one\nhour, participants carried out a self-monitoring blood glucose test (SMBG, similar to the capillary test)\nand entered this value into the CGMS?. The participant carried out this procedure again three times\nbefore midnight.\nThe following morning, participants came into the clinic after fasting and remained there for\nabout three hours. Capillary blood samples were taken using a lancet. A drop of blood was collected in\na HemoCue @ cuvette and blood concentration measured using a HemoCue ? Glucose 201 Analyzer\n(Helsingborg, Sweden). Two fasting blood glucose concentrations were taken, then the participant\n    i  n m sns    s   po  n p\nand 120 minutes after the participant had begun eating. If the blood glucose concentration had not\nreturned to within 0.2 mmol/L of the baseline concentration at 120 minutes, further blood samples were\ntaken at 150 and 180 minutes. Self-monitoring blood glucoses were also taken at 0, 30 and 120\nminutes and entered into the CGMS?.\nAt the end of the morning, participants left the clinic to continue their normal activities but\nindividuals were away from the clinic they carried out two further SMBG measurements. At the end of\nthe third day the CGMS? was removed.\nThe effect of consuming four 25 g reference drinks and eight foods was investigated over a 4-\n5 week period. In each week, two foods (Table 1) and a 25 g glucose reference were measured in\nrandom order. The incremental area under the blood glucose response curve (AUC) for both capillary\nand CGMS? blood sampling methods was calculated geometrically to 180 minutes (Wolever &\nJenkins, 1986). Areas where the curve dropped below baseline were excluded. For the CGMS?, the\nblood glucose levels were measured every five minutes up to a maximum of 180 minutes. Using the\ncapillary sampling method, measurements were available at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180\nminutes.\nThe GGE of the test food was calculated as GGE/portion size by dividing the AUCtest food by\naverage GGE/serve for each food was taken as the average of the eight individuals. The average GGE\nvalues were compared using paired t-tests. The rankings of the foods for each method were compared\nusing the non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the GGE values measured by capillary and CGMS? blood sampling methods\nfor the various foods, as well as the mean difference in values between the two methods. Differences\nbetween the CGMS? and capillary methods ranged from an overestimation of 6.3 g by the CGMS?\nmethod compared to capillary method to an underestimation by the CGMS? method of 9.4 g. The\nmean differences between the two methods were not consistently overestimated or underestimated.\nThe Pita bread, crackers, yoghurt and pear halves were all overestimated by the CGMS? methods\ncompared to the capillary method whereas the mixed grain bread, breakfast bar, sweet bar and sweet\nbreakfast cereal were all underestimated by the CGMS? method compared to capillary blood\nsampling. The mixed grain bread was the only food to show a significant difference in GGE values\nbetween capillary and CGMS? sampling methods, with a difference of 9.4 g between the two methods.",

Three of the eight foods were ranked\nsignificantly differently by the CGMS? than by the capillary method. The standard deviations of the\nrankings were larger for the CGMS? than the capillary method (p=0.01), meaning that there was less\n consistency in the rankings for individuals using the CGMS@ method.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study investigated whether it was possible to use CGMS? as a method to determine the\nblood glucose response to foods rather than capillary blood sampling. Currently capillary blood\nsampling is accepted as the preferred method for determining the blood glucose response of foods.\nThis study indicated that the CGMS? was a more variable measure of blood glucose response to foods.\nA possible reason why similar GGE values were not seen for the foods may be because the calculation\nof blood glucose values by the CGMS? relies on a retrospective calibration approach whereby, when a\nself-monitoring blood glucose value is entered into the CGMS?, the programme software uses the\nvalue to retrospectively determine linear calibration constants, which are then used to generate sensor\nglucose values (Mastrototaro, 2000). The problem with this approach is that it means blood glucose\nvalues are not based on real time monitoring. The person's blood glucose in the previous 12 hours and\nthe accuracy between the CGMS? and the self-monitoring blood glucose will all affect the calculation\n of the blood glucoses in the period the study was interested in - the two hours after the food was eaten.\nGiven that the study measured the area under the blood glucose response curve, not the actual blood\nglucose values, a system where blood glucose values were not adjusted retrospectively may work\nbetter. Additionally, the manufacturers state that for optimal efficacy, there needs to be a range in\nblood glucose values during a 24 hour period of greater than 5.6 mmol/L (MiniMed 2004). In normal\nindividuals, because their glucose control is well regulated, it can be difficult to achieve these\ndifferences. In this study, measurements were taken both when participants were fasting and half an\nhour after meals but often differences in blood glucose levels of 5.6 mmol/L were not achieved.\nThere are other techniques being developed using the principle of continuous glucose\nmonitoring that may have more accuracy than the CGMS?, such as techniques based on near infra-red\nspectroscopy. Being able to continuously monitor blood glucose response levels would be useful for\ndetermining blood glucose response for foods, and may help to reduce the variability in these\nmeasurements as well as make studies of foods over longer periods of time and in the context of meals\nand at other time periods of the day easier to conduct.",

TURNER, and J.A.HUDSON\nFood Safety Programme, Institute of Environmental Science & Research, Ltd.,\nChristchurch, New Zealand.\nABSTRACT\nSoy is increasingly used as a food ingredient. In an average New Zealand diet, bread, beer and\nprocessed meats are major contributors to soy intake. Soy consumption is promoted for a number of\nclaimed health benefits including reducing the risk of heart disease and some cancers (breast, prostate\nand lung), and providing relief from menopausal symptoms. The functionality of soy foods for disease\n     o        s\ncompounds - including the isoflavones genistein and daidzein. It is established that the gut microflora\nhas a role in isoflavone metabolism that can influence bioavailability._ This study investigates the\nnature and extent of the microbial metabolism of isoflavones by faecal microflora from New\nZealanders of European origin.  The rates of isoflavone degradation by human faecal microflora\nexposed to daidzein and genistein, both alone and in combination, were studied by high performance\nliquid chromatography. The degradation rate was variable and unpredictable both within (over 15\nweeks) and between individuals (5 subjects). Given the available data, end point health effects\nassociated with the functionality of soy foods are currently unpredictable.\nINTRODUCTION\nSoy is associated with a range of positive health effects, namely stimulation of the immune\nsystem, prevention of bone loss and higher bone mineral density, reduced risk of heart disease, relief\nfrom menopausal symptoms and protection from certain cancers (breast, prostate and lung) (COT,\n2003). Selected health claims for soy may now be legally promoted in the USA (Harland, 2002),\nincreasing soy as a target ingredient for functional foods (Squires, 2005). Key bioactives in soy are the\nisoflavones genistein and daidzein that mimic the female hormone estrogen. A food can only be\nfunctional if the bioactive constituents reach the target cell at an effective dose and our studies of\ndietary exposure to genistein and daidzein show that serum levels are only 0.5 to 1% of the amount\ningested (Thomson, 2005, Thomson, Cressey and Shaw, 2003). The gut microflora has been\nimplicated as having a role in the bioavailability of isoflavones from soy containing foods (Hendrich et\n al., 1998, Rowland et al, 1999, Lampe et al 1998, Turner et al, 2003). This paper reports on studies of\nthe degradation of isoflavones by human faecal microflora as a possible explanation for the low levels\nin serum compared with intake, and to better understand the role of gut microflora on the\nbioavailability of soy isoflavones.\nMATERIALS and METHODS\nChemicals and media\nGenistein (≥98% pure) and daidzein (≥98% pure) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis,\nMO). Stock solutions were prepared in HPLC grade methanol at concentrations of 1.49 mmol/L and\n1.34 mmol/L respectively following the method of Klump et al (2001). Standards were made for each\nisoflavone to produce a concentration series from 7 to 120 μmol/L. Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) Broth\n(Difco) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with water treated by the ElixTM\nsystem (Millipore, Molsheim, France).\nSubjects\nAll subjects were voluntary, healthy New Zealand residents who gave their informed consent.

A 5% faecal slurry\nwas made in a whirlpak bag with BHI broth as the diluent, homogenised in a Bagmixer? (Interscience,\nSt Nom, France) for 30 s, and centrifuged at 1660 x g for 2 min. Four ml aliquots of faecal slurry\nsupernatant were pipetted into sterile tubes containing the appropriate isoflavone preparation. To\naccount for inter-individual variation (all 5 subjects), three series of tubes were prepared containing\n59.8 μmol/L genistein, 64.5 μmol/L daidzein, or a mixture of both at a concentration of 124.3 μmol/L\ntotal isoflavones. A separate incubation tube was removed at each of 4 sampling times over 72 h.\nControls consisted of tubes containing mixed isoflavones in BHI broth (no inoculum). All tubes were\nincubated at 37°C with anaerobic sachets (Oxoid AnaeroGenTM) to create microaerophilic conditions.\nTo assess intra-individual variation with time, the results over 15 weeks from several repetitions of the\nexperiment on Subject A were compared.\nIsolation and preparation of isoflavones\nIsolation of isoflavones was modelled on the method of Xu et al (1995).  Samples were\nquickly vortex mixed and 1 ml passed very slowly through a Maxi-Clean (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) C18\ncartridge (300 mg, 50 μm particle size, 6 nm pore size), pre-wetted with 1 ml 100% methanol, followed\nby 2x2 ml water. The isoflavones were eluted with 2 ml 80% methanol, reduced in volume by rotary\nevaporation and made up to 2 ml in volumetric tubes, with 80% methanol, for analysis by HPLC.\nHPLCprotocol\nHPLC analysis was performed on a Waters WISP 712 coupled with a Waters 600 multisolvent\ndelivery system and Waters Lambda-Max 481 spectrophotometer. Separation was achieved on a\nSpheri-5 MPLC ODS (Brownlee; Applied Biosystems, Melbourne, Australia) C-18 column (4.6 x 220\nmm, 5 μm particle size) protected by a RP-18 ODS NewGuard (PerkinElmer, Melbourne, Australia)\nprefilter column. Methanol/water was used as the mobile phase, employing a gradient of 40% to 65%\n                  \nIsoflavone standards used for each HPLC run had mixed genistein and daidzein at final concentrations\nof 29.9 μmol/L and 32.3 μmol/L respectively.\nQualitycontrol\nReproducibility of the incubations was assessed from triplicate incubations of one faecal\nover 72 h. Efficiency of the Maxi-Clean cartridge extraction method was determined for genistein and\ndaidzein solutions at (59.8 and 64.5μmol/L respectively).\nRESULTS\nThe mean extraction recovery was 67% ± 12 (1 SD) and 64% ± 13 for genistein (n = 34) and\n daidzein (n = 31), respectively. Losses were not accounted for by the water rinses or 80% methanol\nelution and therefore most likely to be associated with lack of, or irreversible, absorption onto the\ncartridge. The HPLC response to the standards of genistein and daidzein was linear (R' =1.0o) over the\nconcentration range analysed (0-128 μmol/l).\nThe reproducibility of degradative characteristics of triplicate faecal samples is shown in\nFigure 1. Whilst two of the replicates were similar, the third replicate was different, with variability\ndaidzein (in combination with genistein) is indicative of analytical variability in the order of ±15%\nsince the isoflavones cannot be synthesized by the microbes. The greater variability observed for 72\ncompared with 24 hours of incubation suggests a microbial component to the variability since more\nat longer incubation times means that differences observed in subsequent studies are preliminary only.",

Faecal incubations for\nSubject A demonstrated considerable variability in gut microfloral degradation activity when sampled\n5 times over 3 months, despite no intentional soy consumption or antibiotic use during this time. This\nvariability within an individual, also observed for one of the other European New Zealand subjects, is\nat variance with the “stable-microflora metabolism\" opinion of others (Hendrich et al, 1998, Zheng et\nal, 2003, Wiseman et al. 2004). Although preliminary, there is no evidence that the methodology failed\nas simultaneous incubations for other subjects showed degradation. No other investigators have\nreported more than duplicate studies for an individual. The intra- and inter individual variability\nobserved means that the bioavailable dose of isoflavones, hence, health outcome, is highly likely to be\nvariable and at this time, unpredictable.

Assessments were conducted upon the effect of the incorporation of the\nfenugreek flour on loaf volume and also the starch digestibility of the breads, following an in vitro\nanalysis of starch degradation. Although the fenugreek material had a negative aspect on the volume of\nthe bread, the amount of starch degradation observed in the fenugreek enriched breads was lower than\nthat observed in the control white bread. This indicated that the addition of fenugreek material had a\npotential to retard the rate and extent of starch digestion, and hence the potential to affect the glycaemic\nresponse to the ingestion of fenugreek enriched breads.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe role of dietary fibre in the attenuation of glycaemic response of individuals is well\ndocumented and the efficacy of dietary fibre appears to be dose related. The term dietary fibre refers to\nthe collection of ingredients which are of plant origin and which resist degradation by human enzymes\nduring digestion. Thus they appear as having zero (or very little) calorie value in foods, and have the\nadditional beneficial role in passing through the digestive tract to act as sources of fermentation for gut\nmicroflora (Brennan 2005).\nA tremendous amount of research has been conducted on the use of non-starch\npolysaccharides such as guar gums (a galactomannan based polysaccharide) in reducing the amount\nand rate of starch degradation (Brennan et al 1993, 1996) and the incorporation of similar non starch\npolysaccharides in model food systems (Tudorica et al 2002). Thus, of interest to today's food industry\nis the possibility of utilising novel plant based ingredients to manipulate food structure, texture and\nhuman nutrition.",
    "Page_51": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30  51\nIn recent years attention has focussed on a range of novel dietary fibres, one of these is the\npolysaccharide fraction obtained from the seeds of the fenugreek plant (genus Trigonella). This\npolysaccharide is similar to guar gum in that it is a highly viscous material which can be used in the\nfood industry as a thickener and stabiliser (Brummer et al., 2003). The seeds of the fenugreek plant\nhave been regarded as having anti-diabetic properties (Sharma et al., 1986, 1990; Sowmya and\nRajyalakshmi, 1999). One of the mechanisms by which such a modulation in glycaemic response is\nachieved could be by the alteration of the viscosity of digested foods and potential subsequent\nimpairment of nutrient availability (Bowling et al., 1981). Another possible mechanism is that the\npolysaccharide can affect effective starch degradation time by restriction of starch accessibility to\nstarch degrading enzymes, and the reduction of starch gelatinisation events.\nThe current study looked at the utilisation of commercially available sources of ground\nfenugreek seeds in a bread product and the effect of fenugreek additions on both loaf characteristics\nand the amount of reducing sugars released from the products.\nMATERIALS ANDMETHODS\ncarbohydrate, 1 g sugar, and 3.5 g dietary fibre) was purchased from local supermarket.

The formation of such a gel-like network would\nimpede the carbohydrate - gluten network developed in breads during mixing and fermentation, thus\nleading to a less elastic network.\nTable 1 Effect of fenugreek addition on loaf volume\n Sample\nLoaf\nLoaf height\nvolume\n(cm)\n(ml)\n Control\n345±6.63a\n8.65±0.13a\n10% fenugreek (FG) addition\n307±4.02b\n7.70±0.11b\n15% fenugreek (FG) addition\n305±3.73b\n7.34±0.20c\n20% fenugreek (FG) addition\n281±2.50c\n6.73±0.18d",

The potential to utilise crop harvest residue and process waste by producing a\nfermented product is investigated. This novel fermented product can act as an additional source of\nantioxidants as well as adding value for the grower. In this study the content of vitamin C and total\nphenolic in broccoli and cauliflower stalks was measured before and after a fermentation process.\nFurther, consumer acceptability for the processed product was determined by three groups from\ndifferent cultural backgrounds.\nThe pith of fresh broccoli stalks had high vitamin C concentrations (mean ± SEM were 714.9\n± 7.1 and 633.5 ± 7.1 mg/100 g dry matter (DM), for large and small stalks, respectively). The outer-\nlayers of fresh broccoli stalks had vitamin C concentrations of 269.9 ± 7.1 and 290.1 ± 7.1 mg/100 g\nDM, for large and small stalks, respectively. Large cauliflower stalks had significantly (P<0.001) lower\nvitamin C concentrations in the pith (481.0 ± 7.1 mg/100 g DM) and higher vitamin C concentrations\nin the outer-layers (355.8 ± 7.1 mg/100 g DM). Total phenolic concentration in the pith of fresh\nbroccoli was 187.8 ± 3.3 and 188.4 ± 3.3 mg/100 g DM, for large and small stalks, respectively. The\nouter-layers of fresh broccoli stalks had total phenolic concentrations of 124.5 ± 3.3 and 116.6 ± 3.3,\nmg/100 g DM, for large and small stalks, respectively. Cauliflower had total phenolic concentrations of\n205.5 ± 3.3 and 175.2 ± 3.3 mg/100 g DM, for pith and outer-layer, respectively. Fermentation\ndecreased (P<0.001) vitamin C concentration to about 55% of that found in fresh stalks of broccoli and\ncauliflower (range 54.3-64%). Also, fermentation caused a reduction in total phenolic concentrations\n(about 28% and 15% for cauliflower and broccoli, respectively). The results from the taste panel\nindicated that the fermented broccoli and cauliflower could be acceptable condiments for consumers\nfamiliar with fermented products.\nINTRODUCTION\n Over the last few years there has been a plethora of biomedical research on antioxidants and\nactive compounds derived from plants. Epidemiological studies have linked the increased consumption\nof plants products with reduced incidence of pathological diseases (Block et al., 1992). Edible plant\nparts are the major source of dietary antioxidants required for health and well-being. Thus, the majority\nof published studies have been of the parts of plants considered edible. These edible parts in many\ncases represent a small fraction of the plant and the remainder is considered harvest residue or\nprocessing waste. These materials have an economic cost and disposal may cause environmental\nconcern.\nAs a result of global environmental changes, urbanization and increased natural disasters,\narable land is decreasing and food shortages are becoming chronic in many countries. Furthermore, in\nthe light of increased populations, there is need to revise the current usage of raw material available for\nfood and too utilize them to minimise waste. Many parts of plants have significant amounts of\nbiologically active compounds (Peschel et al., 2005). Crop harvest residue can be used as a dietary\nantioxidant source. This use may improve financial return, as well as reduce organic waste.\nOf the many plants evaluated for their health benefits much attention has been focused on\nbrassica vegetables. Biologically active compounds from brassica have been shown to prevent or\ninterfere with progress of many diseases (for two good reviews see Beecher, 1994 and Podsedek,\n2005). Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the possible use of broccoli (Brassica\noleracea var. Italica) and cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) stalks as a fermented condiment.",
    "Page_56": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005,Vol. 30 56\nThe study also measured vitamin C and total phenolic changes in broccoli and cauliflower stalks before\nand after fermentation to measure the change in nutritional value.\nMATERIALSANDMETHODS\nSamples\nStanding harvest residue of broccoli was collected from a mid Canterbury commercial grower\nin April 2005, one week after saleable broccoli florets were harvested. Plants were cut about 5 cm from\nthe soil surface and taken to the lab for preparation. The plants were divided into edible florets, leaves,\nstalks, flowered buds and woody parts and trimmings (Table 1). Broccoli stalks were grouped into\nlarge and small sized stalks based on their morphology (each plant had a large stem with branched\nsmall stalks).\nTable 1: Composition of broccoli harvest remains and cauliflower processing waste.\nBroccoli harvest residue\nCauliflower\nkg\n%\nkg\n%\nEdible Florets\n1.49\n9.57\n11.84\n62.55\nLeaves\n3.04\n19.56\n4.44\n23.45\n Stalks\n3.38\n21.75\n2.25\n11.89\n Flowered buds\n1.96\n12.60\nWoody parts and trimmings\n5.67\n36.51\n0.40\n2.11\nTotal\n15.54\n18.93\nTen whole cauliflowers (average weight ± SD was 1.58 ± 0.55 kg) were purchased from a\nChristchurch supermarket. Cauliflower has a large stem with no branching thus cauliflower stems were\nclassed as large stalks. Cauliflowers were divided into different parts similar to broccoli harvest\nresidue. Stalks from both plants were washed under warm running water (= 45°C), patted dried with\npaper towel and then fermented. Stalks from broccoli and cauliflower were placed in separate clean\nglass containers with other ingredients (herbs, spices and whole garlic cloves) and the mixture was\ntopped with 6% brine solution at a stalk to brine ratio of 4:1 w/v. The mixture was left to ferment at\nroom temperature (= 20°C) for 3 weeks.\nBefore analysis both fresh and fermented broccoli and cauliflower samples were peeled and\ndivided into pith and outer-layer (contained epidermis, cortex and the vascular bundles tissues)\nreflecting the edible and non-edible parts, respectively (Table 2). This resulted in the following samples\nfor broccoli: fresh large broccoli pith, fresh large broccoli outer layer, fresh small broccoli pith, fresh\n o    d      r \nfermented small broccoli pith and fermented small broccoli outer layer. Cauliflower had the following\npith and fermented large cauliflower outer layer. Fermented pith from large broccoli and cauliflower\nwere sliced and used for the sensory evaluation. Samples for chemical analysis were frozen, freeze\ndried, pulverized, vacuum packed and stored at -20 °C until analysis.\nTable 2: Processing yield and edibleyield of fermented broccoli and cauliflower stalks\nas a percentage of original raw materials.\nBroccoli stalks (%)\nCauliflower (%)\nlarge\nsmall\nlarge\nFermented yield\n97.26\n95.50\n97.60\nEdible pith yield\n43.10\n41.23\n53.85\nMeasurement ofVitaminC\nThe vitamin C content was determined by AOAC method (AOAC, 1990) using a 670\nTitroprocessor (Metrohm, Switzerland).

The panellists recorded their ethnicity and results were then split into three groups; New\nZealander; Asian and others (Table 3). The panellists were asked to evaluate the physical and flavour\ncharacteristics as well as the overall acceptability of the products on a 1 (dislike very much) to 5 (like\nfermented product. In addition, the panellists were asked directly which product they preferred most.\nTable 3: Structure of panellists for consumer's perception of fermented\nbroccoli and cauliflower stalks.\nNew Zealanders\nAsian\nOthers\nNumber of panellists\n20\n22\n6\nMales\n5\n13\n4\nFemale\n15\n9\n2\nAge (average; range)\n24 (18-56)\n33 (20-48)\n30 (21-37)\nStatistical analysis\nData for vitamin C and total phenolic were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nusing PROC GLM in MINITAB (Release 14.1). Differences between means were determined using\nFisher's least significant difference. Data for consumer's perception of the fermented products were\nanalysed using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) routine in GenStat (Release 7,\nLawes Agricultural Trust, VSN International Ltd., Rothamstead, U.K.), and the significance of model\nterms were determined by Wald tests. Means presented were those estimated by the REML routine.\nRESULTS ANDDISCUSSION\nRaw material and processing\nAfter the broccoli was harvested the residue still contained 9.5% of edible florets. About 22%\nof the residue was stalks that can be utilized as a raw material for further processing (e.g.\nfermentation). These materials are normally mulched into the soil as picking the secondary florets is\nnot a financially viable practice and currently there is no economical use for harvest residues.\nCauliflower had lower percentage of stalks (about 12%) because of the trimming process prior to retail\nsale (Table 1). This percentage would increase if the harvest remains were included. While broccoli\nand cauliflower stalks had similar processed yield after fermentation, the edible pith yield for\ncauliflower was at least 10% higher than that of broccoli (Table 2). This higher pith yield seems to\nhave resulted from differences in the geometrical properties and the ratio of out-layer to pith for the\ntwo crops.\nVitamin C\n Fresh large broccoli stalks had higher (P<0.001) concentrations of vitamin C compared with\nsmall ones (Table 4). Vitamin C concentrations in the pith of fresh broccoli (714.9 ± 7.1 and 633.5 ±\nn  ( >     ( s n      o",

It is well known that broccoli florets contain high levels of vitamin C (Davey et al., 2000;\n146 mg/100 g wet weight (WM). This variation was attributed to environmental (eg. climatic,\n geographical conditions) and agricultural practices (e.g. irrigation conditions; fertilization), (Podsedek,\n2005). In the present study, the freeze dried pith of fresh broccoli stalks had 43 mg/ 100 g WM, which\n29% loss in vitamin C due to preparation and freeze drying was observed (fresh pith before freeze\ndrying was 61.17 ± 3 mg/100 g WM). This is in agreement with results of Favell (1998) who reported a\nplants were not exposed to light and temperature conditions that enhance vitamin C accumulation.\nSeasonal effects on vitamin C accumulation in plants are well documented (Davey et al., 2000;\nPodsedek, 2005). Large cauliflower stalks had significantly (P<0.001) lower vitamin C concentrations\nin the pith (481 mg/100 g DM) and higher vitamin C concentrations in the outer-layers (356 mg/100 g\n DM) than broccoli. Fermentation decreased (P< 0.o01) vitamin C concentration in the edible portion\n(pith) to about 55% of that found in the pith of fresh stalks of broccoli. Also, there was about 44% loss\nin vitamin C content in cauliflower pith as a result of fermentation. Although almost 50% of the\noriginal vitamin C content in stalks was lost due to fermentation, this process is more efficient than\nstorage at room temperature or partial chilling for longer periods. According to Favell (1998) broccoli\nflorets lost 80% of its vitamin C during ambient or partial chilling/ambient storage for 3 weeks. Davey\n(after acerola, rosehip, guava, blackcurrant, kale and green pepper). In New Zealand, many of the high\nvitamin C sources (e.g. acerola, rosehip, guava and kale) are not available fresh to the average\nconsumers. Thus, advice on the use of broccoli and cauliflower and their stalks as rich sources for\nvitamin C is important.\nTable 4: Concentration of Vitamin C (mg/100 g DM) and total phenolic compounds (mg/100 g\nDM) in Brassica stalks before and after fermentation.\nBrassica\nSize\nTreatment\nPart\nMean vitamin C\n Mean total phenolic\n(mg/100 g DM)\ncompounds\n(mg/100 g DM)\nBroccoli\nsmall\nfresh\npith\n633.5b\n188.4b\nBroccoli\nsmall\nfresh\n outer layer\n290.1e\n116.6e\nBroccoli\nlarge\nfresh\npith\n714.9a\n187.8bc\nBroccoli\nlarge\nfresh\nouter-layer\n269.9e\n124.5e\nBrocolli\nlarge\nfermented\npith\n366.1d\n161.0d\nCauliflower\nfresh\npith\n481.0c\n205.5a\nCauliflower\nfresh\nouter-layer\n355.8d\n175.2c\nCauliflower\nfermented\npith\n268.7e\n158.9d\nCauliflower\nfermented\nouter-layer\n227.4f\n111.0e\nSEM= 7.1 LSD = 29.1 SEM= 3.3 LSD = 13.5\nWithin a column for each factor, means that do not have a common letter are significantly different at\nthe 1% level, SEM = standard error of mean, LSD = least significant difference (1%).\nTotalphenoliccompounds\n Size did not affect (P>0.05) the total phenolic content of fresh broccoli stalks (187.8 ± 3.3 and\n188.4 ± 3.3 mg GAE/100 g DM, for large and small stalks, respectively, Table 4). Total phenolic\ncontent of broccoli florets was reported to be in the range of 34.5 to 337 mg of GAE/100 g WM\n(Podsedek, 2005). This wide variation was due to the use of different extraction methods. However, it\nseems that soil and environmental conditions (reflected in country of origin) played a role in this\nvariation (Podsedek, 2005). Also, in most of the reported studies, the contribution of vitamin C to total\nphenolic content was not taken into account. Indeed, when harsh extraction conditions were used, total\nphenolic content in broccoli (florets and stem) was low (Zhang and Hamauzu; 2004). For instance, in\nthe present study total phenolic content in the broccoli stalks was 11.3 mg GAE/100 g WM compared\nwith 4.5 mg GAE/100 g WM broccoli stems reported by Zhang and Hamauzu (2004).\nThe pith of fresh cauliflower had similar total phenolic content (205.5 ± 3.3 mg GAE/100 g\nDM) to the pith of fresh broccoli, whereas the outer layer of the fresh cauliflower had higher (P<0.001)",
    "Page_59": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 3059\ntotal phenolic content than the broccoli outer layer (Table 4). Fermentation caused a reduction in total\nphenolic concentrations (about 28% and 15% for cauliflower and broccoli, respectively). This was\nexpected as polyphenols are known to degrade during fermentation (Svanberg and Lorri, 1997).\nConsumer's perception of the fermented product\nForty eight people took part in the consumer panel. The panellists expressed their ethnicity\nand were then split into three groups: New Zealander, Asian, and other (Table 3). The majority (77%)\nof the Asian group were Chinese while those in the other group included those of Middle Eastern\n ethnicity and respondents who did not complete the ethnicity question.\nThere was a significant difference in the overall acceptability of the fermented products\nbetween groups of different ethnicity (Table 5). The Asian and others panellists found that the\nfermented products were acceptable or very acceptable, while 70% of the New Zealand panellists\nranked the products with 1 (dislike very much) or 2 (dislike). This may reflect a cultural background\ndifference in that the Asian and others groups were more familiar with fermented vegetables while in\nNew Zealand the consumption of such products is low.\nFermented cauliflower stalks were perceived as more preferable than broccoli stalks (Table 5).\nThe fermented cauliflower ranked more highly in terms of saltiness, overall flavour, mouthfeel and\nhardness (P<0.05). Although the pale green colour of the broccoli product attracted comment, there\nwas no significant difference in the acceptability of the colour of the products. Both products attracted\nscores at both end of the acceptability scale from dislike very much to like very much.\n The overall acceptability of fermented products was not significantly different between males\nand females (Table 5). Female panellists reported higher scores for all the evaluation parameters, but \nsignificant differences were found in colour, smell and hardness. When the interaction of sex and type\nof fermented product was considered (data not shown) females gave a higher ranking to the cauliflower\nfermented product than the broccoli product. The panellists were also asked about their likelihood to\npurchase. There was again a significant difference (P<0.001) between the ethnic groups. Using scale of\n1 (very unlikely) to 5 (very likely); with 3 the neutral position indicated as “maybe\", the predicted\ndifference in the likelihood of purchase between the broccoli and cauliflower fermented products. This \n data indicate that these fermented products may have potential in markets with a high proportion of \nconsumers who are familiar with fermented products. These markets could include Asian and\nMediterranean countries as well as other countries where there are large populations of these\nconsumers.\nTable 5: Average taste panel scores for fermented broccoli and cauliflower stalks.\nSweet\n Colour\nSmell\nSalt\nFlavour\nHard-\nMouth-\nAccept-\n-ness\nness\nfeel\nance\nEthnicity\nNZ\n2.13a\n2.64a\n2.33a\n2.36a\n2.14a\n2.77a\n2.46a\n2.32a\nAsian\n3.11b\n3.60b\n3.57b\n3.70b\n3.54b\n3.85b\n3.55b\n3.53b\nOthers\n4.62b\n4.27b\n4.89b\n4.08b\n3.70b\n4.80b\n4.78b\n4.17b\n0.001\n0.003\n0.001\n0.001\n0.001\n0.003\n0.001\n0.001\nP\nBroccoli\n3.43\n3.44\n3.60\n3.61\n3.36a\n3.86\n3.87a\n3.53a\nCauliflower\n3.14\n3.56\n3.60\n3.14\n2.89b\n3.75\n3.20b\n3.15b\nP\nNS\nNS\nNS\n0.034\n0.004\nNS\n0.001\n0.002\nFemale\n3.40\n3.78a\n3.99a\n3.45\n3.33\n4.11a\n3.87\n3.50\n3.23b\nMale\n3.17\n3.21b\n3.03\n2.92\n3.50b\n3.32\n3.17\nP\nNS\n0.032\n0.011\nNS\nNS\n0.038\nNS\nNS\nWithin\na column for each factor, means that do not have a common letter are significantly different at the\nstated P value.\nCONCLUSIONS",

Cleary', C. S. Brennan'2 and R.. Andersson?\n'School of biological Sciences, University of Plymouth, Drakes Circus, Plymouth, UK.\n'Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University, New Zealand\n'Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden\nABSTRACT\nSoluble fibres such as (1→3)(1 →4)-β-glucan (hereafter referred to as β-glucan) have been\nillustrated to be effective in reducing postprandial glycaemic, insulin, and cholesterol responses in\nhumans. Cereals, such as oat and barley are rich sources of β-glucan, with numerous studies\ndemonstrating their nutritional benefits. Much research has focused upon how these β-glucans can be\nis in part related to dose, molecular weight, fine structure and rheological characteristics of extracted \nfavourable to native cereals or flours, since larger doses of β-glucan can be incorporated into products\nat smaller replacement levels, thus possibly reducing negative changes to product quality and consumer\nacceptance. However, extraction procedures can negatively alter the physical properties of β-glucans,\nthrough molecular degradation, thus reducing their nutritional efficacy. There is also evidence to\nsuggest that certain β-glucan extracts may also be also susceptible to degradation during processing\nand intestinal transit.\nThis paper provides a profile of the behaviour of a barley β-glucan extract, GlucagelTM, and\ndifferently isolated beta-glucan materialin white wheat bread, during fermentation, baking and in vitro\ndigestion, examining not only physico-chemical and nutritional (in vitro starch digestibility) changes\nwithin the breads, but also the susceptibility of this extract to molecular degradation.\nINTRODUCTION\n Barley beta-glucan has been the centre of research and legislative attention recently, with the\naim of awarding barley beta-glucan with the same functional health claims as those of oat beta-glucans.\nThe association between beta-glucan and its potential to manipulate cholesterol and glycaemic\nresponses in individuals is well established. Previous research has shown that the incorporation of\nbarley beta glucan into starch systems (Symons and Brennan, 2004a), bread and dough material\n(Symons and Brennan, 2004b), pasta (Brennan et al., 2006) and dairy products (Tudorica et al 2005)\ncan also affect the structural integrity of food. There appears to be a firm link between this structurising\nability of the beta-glucan and the way that it modifies food quality (from a consumers acceptance and\nResearch has indicated that the molecular weight of beta-glucans has a role in altering the\nvisco-elastic nature of the food matrix",

Comprehensive\nnutrition screening identifies adolescents who have poor nutritional status, as well as those who are at\nrisk for developing nutrition-related problems. This study attempts to further understand the nutritional\nrequirements of adolescent athletes participating in competitive sport while maintaining optimal growth\nestimated diet and activity records. Body composition was assessed using the ISAK restricted\nproforma. Biochemical indices of nutrient and physiological status included; serum ferritin (F), serum\niron (Fe), transferrin saturation (TS), serum folate (SF) and red cell folate (RCF), vitamin B12, creatine\nkinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cortisol (C), C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as total\ncholesterol (TC), LDL-Cholesterol (LDL), HDL-Cholesterol (HDL) and triglycerides (TG). Mean\nenergy intake was found be 10726 (6649-15313) kJ/d while expenditure was 11138 (7526-16492)kJ/d.\nTotal sugars (23.3 %TE) exceeded national guidelines of 15%TE. Absolute protein intake (1.7 g/kg)\nwas below the recommended 2g/kg. All indices of nutritional status appear normal, however, three\nwere found to have stage 1 and one stage 3 iron deficiency. Serum CK, LDH and C exceeded normal\nvalues.  Significant differences (p<0.o5) were observed between males and females for protein\n(+23.7g), BMI (-2.7kg/m?), LDH (+84.4U/L) and CK (+135.4U/L).This study provides the foundation\nfor further comparisons of nutritional demands between sports for aspiring athletes and with non-\nswimming, matched peers.\nINTRODUCTION\n Children and adolescent's dietary intake influences normal growth, health status, as well as\nlifelong nutritional habits (Perks, Roemmich et al. 2000). It is well known that negative energy balance\nin young athletes has far more severe consequences for growth, development, health and sport\nperformance than in adults. Nutritional status measures can provide the foundation for monitoring an\nathlete's response to training from dietary perspective (Deakin 2000). Comprehensive dietary\nscreening identifies adolescents who have poor nutritional status, as well as those who are at risk for\nAlthough a number of investigators have studied the nutritional status of adolescent swimmers\nduring peak training (Hawley and Williams 1991) (Berning, Troup et al. 1991) but none have\nexamined the status of young adolescent swimmers in New Zealand. It has been widely shown that\nenergy intakes remain constant despite fluctuations in training volume or intensity (Imbeault, Saint-\nPierre et al. 1997). Constantini has also shown energy expenditure far exceeds energy intake in\nadolescent swimmers (Constantini, Eliakim et al. 2000). Using doubly-labeled water (DLW), Trappe\net al (Trappe, Gastaldelli et al. 1997) showed that training 5-6 hours per day contributed to 23.4 ±\n2.1MJ/d of expended energy, in contrast to 13.1 ± 1.0MJ/d of energy intake. Studies of female\nswimmers have also shown relatively high expenditure in low volume (< 3.3km/d) swimming\n(Vallieres, Tremblay et al. 1989; Jones and Leitch 1993)\nAdolescent female athletes have been shown to have both inadequate protein and\nmicronutrient intakes despite having better nutritional knowledge than non-athletes (Cupisti,\nD'Alessandro et al. 2002). Similarly, sub-optimal micronutrient intakes for iron and calcium have been\nobserved in adolescent swimmers (Berning, Troup et al. 1991; Bandini, Must et al. 2003) and figure\nskaters (Ziegler, Sharp et al. 2002).

    "Page_67": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 67\nHigh volume training and competition is known induce physiological stress on muscle tissue.\nAn early study showed dietary strategies can affect CK and LDH levels post-training (Cade, Reese et\nal. 1991). Nutrient selection during recovery was an important predictor for changes in muscle stress.\nIt was shown CK and LDH levels were reduced with milk protein solutions immediately post-training\nindicating improved physiological recovery. Thus, the importance of optimal dietary strategies during\nrecovery high volume training, particularly in adolescence, is paramount.\nBy assessing dietary trends, associated nutrient intakes nutritional status and indices of muscle\nstress, this study aims to educate young competitive swimmers (and parents) of the consequences food\n choice and subsequent nutrient intake may have on health and physical performance.\nMATERIALSANDMETHODS\nParticipants\n Twenty seven (15 male, 12 female) local sub-elite swimmers from a Hawkes Bay swim team\nparticipated in this study. All data was collected during a period of medium-high volume training in\nwhich swimmers were training minimum of two hours per day, five days per week. Participants\ncompleted an initial health and demographic questionnaire which included number of sports\nparticipated in, nutritional supplement use, source of supplement information and stage of pubertal\ndevelopment (Tanner 1952).\nDietary intake\nFour-day estimated food records were collected to determine nutrient intakes. These included\nthree weekdays and one weekend day. To ensure accuracy, swimmers and parents were trained in a\ngroup session as well as provided with detailed instructions for reporing serving sizes, food\npreparation and food/beverage recording. Food records were analysed using SERVE (Serve Nutrition\nSystems, version 5.01, Sydney, Australia) . Analysed nutrient data were reviewed with individual\nreports and group results presented during scheduled nutrition counseling sessions.\nEnergy expenditure\nFour-day self-reported physical activity records were completed immediately after food\nrecords. Swimmers and parents were trained in a group session and provided with detailed instructions\nfor accurately reporting daily physical activity. Daily energy expenditure was then estimated using\nmetabolic equivalent data using the techniques developed by Ainsworth and colleagues (Ainsworth,\nHaskell et al. 1993; Ainsworth, Haskell et al. 2000). All estimations of energy expenditure were\ncalculated in calories (kcal), which were multiplied by a factor of 4.18 for kilojoule (kJ) conversion.\nBody composition\nThe body mass and height of each participant was measured using an electronic scale and a\nwall-mounted stadiometer. These were determined prior to evening training in their swimsuits. Body\ncomposition was assessed using the ISAK Restricted Proforma. Sum of seven skinfolds (S7SF)were\nmeasured using Holtain calipers and percentage body fat (%BF) was calculated as a mean of three\nregression equations for children (Lohman 1986; Slaughter, Lohman et al. 1988; Goran, Driscoll et al.\n1996).\nBloodsamplecollection and analysis\nFasting blood samples (20mL) were collected prior to a morning training session from the\nantecubetal vein. All samples were taken from the antecubital vein. Serum iron and TIBC were\nmeasured using Colorimetric Assay (Hitachi 917, Roche Diagnostics NZ, Auckland). Serum Ferritin,\nSF, RCF and B12 and C were measured using direct chemiluminescence (Advia Centaur, Bayer\nDiagnostics NZ, Auckland), CRP was measured using Immunoturbidimetric Assay (Hitachi 917,\nRoche Diagnostics NZ, Auckland), LDH and CK by Photometric Assay (Hitachi 917, Roche\nDiagnostics NZ, Auckland), T-Chol and TGs by Enzymatic Colorimetric Assay (Hitachi 917, Roche\nDiagnostics NZ, Auckland) and HDL by Homogenous Enzymatic Colorimetric Assay (Hitachi 917,\nRoche Diagnostics NZ, Auckland).\nStatistics",

Recently, Leiper and Maughan\n(Leiper and Maughan 2004) used diet and activity records to estimate energy balance while swimming\nfour kilometers per session nine times per week. Similar results were observed with an energy deficit\nof 5.5%. Despite the recognised limitations associated with diet and activity records, the observed\nmean energy deficit, however small, has future implications, especially when training volume increases\n and should not be ignored.",
    "Page_70": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 3070\nNutritional status\nOverall, these young swimmers had a relatively good nutritional status. The omission of\nHaemoglobin (Hb) as an index of iron status presented a major limitation in the assessment of this\npopulation. Only estimates of iron status were provided based on previous iron status assessments\n(Looker, Dallman et al. 1997). Providing Hb, in combination with parameters used in this study,\nenables a more accurate diagnosis of iron status. Also, as protein status was observed to be below that\nrecommended for adolescent athletes, an identification of protein balance may be a better indication of\nprotein status. In future, this can be estimated from daily protein intake and rate of urinary nitrogen\nexcretion (Boisseau, Le Creff et al. 2002).\nDietaryquality\nOptimal dietary intake is a major determinant of performance, especially at the elite level.\n Burke previously reported poor nutritional practices in many athletes (Burke 1999). Other studies have\nalso reported sub-optimal micronutrient intakes in adolescent athletes (Berning, Troup et al. 1991;\nBoisseau, Le Creff et al. 2002; Cupisti, D'Alessandro et al. 2002; Bandini, Must et al. 2003). Mean\ndietary data in this study showed micronutrient intake met recommended levels.  However,\nmacronutrient intake, in particular protein and sugars, did not meet recommended values. Numerous\noverseas studies in adolescent soccer players (Boisseau, Le Creff et al. 2002) and swimmers (Ousley-\nPahnke, Black et al. 2001; Paschoal and Amancio 2004), have shown protein intake was less than the\nrecommended 2g/kg per day. Quality of carbohydrate intake may also be of concern. Although sugars\nprovide the basis for energy intake in times of high carbohydrate demand, exceeding the recommended\n15%TE provides some nutritional concern, especially when total energy intake is not particularly high.\nRecovery nutrition\n In addition to providing education on food choices for nutritional quality, strategies aimed at\ntiming of food choices around training may be important for recovery in these swimmers. Swimming\nhas been shown to increase levels of muscle damage in swimmers during high volume training (Cade,\nReese et al. 1991). Cade showed that milk protein solutions post-training significantly reduced indices\nof muscle stress. This may have significant implications, especially when muscle damage has been\nimplicated in impaired muscle glycogen restoration post-exercise. Therefore, may warrant further\ninvestigation in young swimmers (Burke 2000).\nFood sources and eating habits\nA review of suitable nutritional interventions for adolescents identified excessive consumption\nsia  s go so ap a s  ns  ps nd) sie e\nwhole-grains, calcium foods and iron (Hoelscher, Evans et al. 2002). Closer to home, 11 to 14 year old\nchildren showed similar trends in the National Children's Nutrition Survey (NCNS) (Parnell, Scragg et\nal.2003).\nThe current swimming population consumed only 3.5 FV and 5.5 BC servings per day (6.4\nincl. bakery products) compared to the recommended 5+ and 6 to 11 serves of FV and BC respectively.\nOur swimming population consumed 5.5 servings per day of sugar, confectionary, ‘treats? or fast food,\npossibly contributing to the higher than recommended contribution of sugar (23%) and saturated fat\n(14%) to energy intake. More than 90% of adolescents report eating snacks between meals which are\nsa lo jo p suo on snqo ueo pue sun pog isy ie you, no poog un, se pss \nintake (Wahl 1999). Often, consumers are unaware of what constitutes “healthy’ snack foods,\nproviding direction for education of these swimmers and parents.\nNutrition education vs nutrition practice\nMany authors stress the importance of nutritional education to adopt dietary strategies that\nwill subsequently optimise health as well as athletic performance (Burke 1995; Grandjean 1997; Metzl\n1999). However, nutrition knowledge may not always be converted into actual dietary behaviour\n(Chapman, Toma et al. 1997). A recent study found nutritional intake was poorer among adult soccer\nplayers than in adolescents (Ruiz, Irazusta et al. 2005), further supporting the fact knowledge may not\nlead to optimal food choice. In contrast, sports participation in adolescent females had a positive\ninfluence on dietary habits and nutrition knowledge (Cupisti, D'Alessandro et al. 2002).\nOur study sampled young adolescents, for whom dietary intake, is often beyond their control.\nBoth Cupisti et al (2002) and Ruiz et al (2005) (Cupisti, D'Alessandro et al. 2002; Ruiz, Irazusta et al.",
    "Page_71": "2005) suggest providing nutritional education at an early age while others believe the application of\nthis knowledge is related to the stage of behaviour change (King 2005). Either way, the environment in\nwhich we educate our adolescent athletes about nutrition must be all encompassing to include the child\n(athlete) as well as coaches, schools and parents, focusing on ways we can put education into practice.\nOverall, the nutritional status of this population is in line with recommended levels. However\nthere are dietary trends that may be implicated in poor recovery and result in suboptimal health and\nswimming performance for some participants. This study provides the foundation for comparisons\nbetween sports for adolescent athletes and with non-swimming, age and sex-matched peers.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n,  u s p sns d sn hm sn rm  on s \nHeretaunga Sundevils.

However many studies in the field have not included detailed information on\n ss   o,         s \nsmoking as a possible contributing cause to low birth weight, but few make any reference to the effects\nof alcohol intake during pregnancy.  Current evidence indicates that ethanol exposure is a nutritional\nfactor that must be considered in assessing the relationship between low birth weight and subsequent\nhealth outcomes.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Barker Hypothesis (Barker, 1992) proposes that low birth weight correlates with\nsubsequent development of adverse health outcomes, such as diabetes and hypertension, in later life.\nLow birth weight has been viewed as an indicator of poor fetal nutrition, and thus the connection has\nbeen made that poor fetal nutrition can ‘programme’ for poor health in later life. Some studies,\nhowever, have not shown clear correlations between birth weight and subsequent poor health\noutcomes. It has been suggested that other factors, such as the rate of body weight increase relative to\nbirth size, may also be important, and that a range of different regression models should be used to test\ndata (for a discussion, see Lucas et al, 1999).\n. There is still, however, much support for the Barker\nHypothesis (Cunningham and Cameron, 2003; Gluckman and Hanson, 2004; Ozanne et al, 2004), and\nmore recent information is beginning to suggest links between birth weight of mothers and outcomes\nfor children in terms of predisposition to poor health outcomes such as high blood pressure, insulin\nresistance and Type 2 diabetes (Barker et al, 2000; Gluckman and Hanson, 2004). This suggests that\nadverse fetal nutrition may affect not only one generation, but succeeding generations as well. This\npossibility has been supported by some animal experiments (Reusens and Remacle, 2005), but not by\nothers (Rogers et al, 2003).\nMolecularmechanisms and confoundingfactors\n Research in the area of long-term effects of fetal nutrition is beginning to move to the study of\nmolecular mechanisms, such as changes in insulin (Plagemann, 2005), insulin-like growth factors\n(Cutfield et al., 2004) other hormones (Davies and Norman, 2002) or DNA methylation (Allegrucci et\nal, 2005), which might explain the effects of maternal diet on health outcomes over immediate and\nsubsequent generations. However, it is becoming apparent that phenotypically similar outcomes (for\nexample predisposition to diabetes) may result from different nutritional insults (for example maternal\ncalorie or protein restriction, maternal diabetes and uterine blood flow restriction) (Reusens and\nRemacle, 2005). Whether a single underlying molecular mechanism can be identified remains to be\nseen.\n Studies using animal models for fetal programming provide a possible explanation of the\ndifficulty in the interpretation of the studies that have been carried out in human populations. In many\nof these population-based studies, low birth weight has been taken as an indicator of ‘poor fetal\nnutrition', but there has been no detailed analysis of the maternal diet or other physical or physiological\nfactors that have led to the low birth weight, so the exact cause of the low birth weight (eg calorie\nrestriction, protein restriction, specific vitamin deficiencies, high carbohydrate diet, placental\ninsufficiency) is not known. The outcome of low birth weight may be similar in each case, but longer-\nterm changes in health status may differ depending on the original nutritional problem. In many\nstudies, confirming the underlying nutritional problem would be difficult, as it would mean asking",

Studies\nare required in which dietary analysis is maintained through pregnancy, and physical or physiological\nfactors that could result in low birth weight are assessed, and then outcomes are monitored. However,\neven this may not be sufficient to fully clarify the effects of maternal nutrition on human development.\nIntergenerational effects may also apply, which would entail following families for several generations\nto fully understand the consequences of maternal nutrition. An additional problem in human studies is\nthat maternal alcohol intake may be a confounding factor of prime importance. There is a large amount\nof evidence that indicates that ethanol affects fetal growth and development, and prior to pregnancy\nabout 80% of women in Western countries consume alcohol as part of their diet, with between 10 and\n80%, depending on age group and country of origin, continuing to consume alcohol during pregnancy\n(Parackal, 200i)'. Including this as a factor to be considered in any detailed dietary analysis\nthroughout pregnancy presents an ethical dilemma, in that a pregnant mother should be strongly\nadvised not to consume any alcohol since there is no known safe level during pregnancy.  With the\nunderstanding that is now developing of the effects of ethanol on fetal development and of fetal\nnutritional programming and intergenerational effects, it is timely to assess whether there could be\nunderlying common, or related, molecular explanations for these effects.\nThe effects of alcohol onfetal development\nEffects on fetal growth.\n It is well recognised that maternal ethanol consumption leads to decreased birth weight. That\nthis is not just a result of associated maternal smoking or poor nutrition has been confirmed using\nstudies in model animals (U.S. Government, 200o). The deficit in fetal growth caused by alcohol\nintake is probably largely attributable to interference with macronutrient metabolism.  Alcohol can\ncause changes in carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism, and has the potential to do this in both the\nmother and the fetus. The effects of ethanol on carbohydrate metabolism are likely to be of particular\nimportance in terms of pancreatic development. A single large dose of ethanol can cause mobilisation\nto restore circulating glucose concentrations during low food intake. Ethanol thus has the potential to\ncause larger than normal fluctuations in glucose supply to the developing fetus - abnormally high if the\nmother is well-fed when intake occurs, and abnormally low if alcohol intake occurs without recent food\nintake. Model animal studies are now confirming that prenatal alcohol exposure can induce β-cell\ndysfunction and insulin resistance in offspring (Chen and Nyomba, 2003). Additional factors that may\n s o            \nutilisation and absorption and metabolism of specific vitamins and micronutrients, notably thiamine,\nfolate and zinc (Lieber and Abittan, 1999).\nOther effects of ethanol on fetal development.\n In addition to ethanol intake during pregnancy leading to low birth weight and small size,\n ethanol exposure can also cause physical, developmental and behavioural abnormalities, a syndrome\ntermed Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)'. Even moderate alcohol exposure during pregnancy may lead\nto some abnormalities and the inclusive term used for such effects is *Fetal Alcohoi Spectrum Disorder\n(FASD)'. Cellular mechanisms that cause these effects are beginning to be clarified (U.S. Government,\n 2000). Alcohol can affect the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and can interfere with\nthe actions of growth factors and cell adhesion molecules - all vital to the correct growth and\ndevelopment of the fetus, in particular of complex organs such as the brain and the pancreas.\nUnderlying molecular mechanisms may include interference by ethanol in the retinoid signalling\nsystem, and the actions of ethanol on celular redox state and mitochondrial metabolism.\nEffects of ethanol on the actions of retinoic acid.\nRetinoic acid binds to retinoic acid receptors, and the complex acts as a transcription factor to\nswitch  genes on or off during fetal and cellular development. Retinol (vitamin A) is converted to\nretinal by enzymes related to those involved in ethanol metabolism and the presence of ethanol can\ninterfere with retinoid metabolism (U.S. Government, 200o). Retinoic acid is crucial in guiding the\ncorrect formation of craniofacial features and limb buds - hence the physical deformities that may be\nI It is notable that the 80% statistic is derived from New Zealand teenagers.\n2 Standard milk can be purchased at a lower unit price than trim milk, although there is no independent",

In addition, however, retinoic acid is crucial to\nthe correct development of neuronal cells and the cellular processes that interconnect them, and of glial\ncells. Interference by ethanol in these processes may well explain the mental and behavioural changes\nthat are observed with FASD (Grummer et al, 20o0). Evidence is now also becoming available to\nsuggest that the retinoid signalling system is important in early pancreatic development (Kadison et al,\n2001) thus providing a route through which ethanol could specifically interfere with pancreatic\ndevelopment.\nThe actions of ethanol on cellular redox state and mitochondrial metabolism.\nThe enzymes that convert ethanol to acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde to acetate require NAD*,\nwhich is converted to NADH. As with other metabolites that are oxidised, such as glucose, this NADH\nis re-oxidised via the mitochondrial electron transport chain. As indicated above, ethanol metabolism\nincreases the ratio of [NADH] to [NAD'] in many tissues, thus potentially affecting all metabolic\nprocesses that depend on the redox state of the cell. In liver cells, for example, the altered redox state\ndue to ethanol metabolism can inhibit gluconeogenesis from lactate, and the function of the citric acid\ncycle. The latter effect will slow the oxidation of fatty acids, and contributes to the accumulation of fat\nin the liver during ethanol metabolism (Lieber and Abittan, 1999). The changed ratio of NADH to\nNADt may also contribute to the formation of reactive oxygen species by the mitochondrial electron\n n  d s n  na r  p  s p  \noccurring in developing fetal tissues would have long-term metabolic consequences. As an example,\nelevated blood glucose concentrations, and damage to mitochondrial DNA may contribute to pancreatic\ndysfunction that continues after precipitating hyperglycemia has been resolved, leading to the\nphenomenon that has been referred to as “hyperglycemic memory' (Brownlee, 2001).\nCONCLUSION\nReusens and Remacle (2005) have suggested that a common theme of reprogramming of\nmitochondrial function may explain susceptibility to metabolic disorders after fetal exposure to both\nearly malnutrition and maternal diabetes. A similar explanation could account for vulnerability to\nmetabolic disorders arising from prenatal exposure to ethanol. It is therefore possible that\nmitochondrial damage due to oxidative stress may provide a unifying molecular mechanism to explain\nfetal developmental changes and long-term health effects arising from ethanol exposure, maternal\ndiabetes or other maternal dietary influences such as calorie and/or protein restriction.\nSince mitochondrial DNA is almost exclusively maternally inherited, this also provides a\nmechanism for intergenerational transmission of metabolic effects. Abnormal mitochondrial function,\nwith consequent generation of oxidative stress and abnormalities in cellular redox state, would also\nlead to disruption of other cellular processes, some of which would provide further possible routes for\nintergenerational transmission of metabolic changes. For example, oxidative stress due to ethanol\nmetabolism may alter s-adenosyl methionine concentrations (Mato et al, 1997), which may in turn alter\n A further concern related to both ethanol exposure and hyperglycemia resulting from maternal\nto oxidative stress could occur in oocytes prior to pregnancy. If this can occur, it is not sufficient to\nrecommend strict adherence to an alcohol-free, well balanced diet just when pregnant or when\npregnancy is possible. Such precautions would be necessary throughout the lifetime of a woman until\nthe end of the reproductive years.\n Owing to the ethical difficulty of undertaking appropriately controlled studies in human\npopulations, we may never be able to conclusively prove to what extent maternal ethanol consumption\ncan be a contributing cause for adverse long-term health outcomes in low birth-weight babies.\nHowever, the evidence accumulating from animal studies is compelling enough to indicate that New\n Zealand should move to a universal recommendation of abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy or\nwhen pregnancy is possible, as has been done in the United States since the early 1980's. Alcoholic\nbeverages should also be labelled with a specific warning about the danger of alcohol consumption\nduring pregnancy.",

The development of a new food-based\nmethod for the assessment of similarities between diets among individuals undergoing acculturation is\nis piloted on dietary data collected from the multicultural community of East Oxford, UK. The method\ndetermines the amount of ethnic overlap between foods listed in food diaries collected from 155 middle\nschool children. Results indicate that the diets of British and W.

In conclusion, conducting similarity coefficient analysis on the diets of\nmay be an indication of degree of dietary acculturation.\nINTRODUCTION\n\"Dietary” acculturation is the process whereby individuals of one culture adopt the eating\npatterns and dietary choices of another culture as a result of exposure to the new culture (Satia et al,\n2001). Dietary acculturation in Western societies with the adoption of Western eating habits has proven\nto be a risk factor for chronic diseases, such as is seen among Cambodian refugees in the US (Palinkas\nand Pickwell, 1995). Depending upon the degree of dietary acculturation of an ethnic group, dietary\nrecommendations will vary; therefore, the ability to measure dietary acculturation may help in the\ndevelopment of appropriate dietary intervention strategies (Satia et al, 2001). While there are some\nsophisticated measures of general acculturation, such as the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican\nAmericans, often these scales do not measure dietary practices specifically and provide little\ninformation about dietary habits (Satia-Abouta et al, 2002). Recent efforts to develop measures of\ndietary acculturation have resulted in some food-based scales that have proven useful in specific\nsettings for specific ethnic groups (Yang and Fox, 1979; Lv and Cason, 2004; Satia et al, 2001; and\nKim and Chan, 2004). However, there are several limitations to these food-based dietary acculturation\nscales. First, they depend upon respondent memory of recall dietary intakes when they first came into\nthe host country. Secondly, they cannot be used to compare the acculturation process between multiple\ngroups residing in a multicultural community, nor between those members of the same ethnic group\nresiding in different communities. Lastly, they fail to recognize the bi- and multicultural dietary\nsome of these limitations has been recommended (Satia-Abouta et al, 2002). The purpose of this paper\nis to present a new method for the rapid assessment of dietary similarities between ethnic groups,\nwhich if applied appropriately, may be used as a measure of dietary acculturation.\nMATERIALSANDMETHODS\nSimilarity coefficient data analysis\n Ecologists use similarity coefficient analyses as a measure of niche overlap (Schoener, 1970),\nand have modified these to measure the amount of dietary overlap occurring between species residing\nin the same habitat, enabling them to measure the extent to which species use the same food resources\n(Abrams, 1980; Weaver and Garman, 1994; Mansfield and Mcardle, 1998). In our research, we've\nused similarity coefficient analyses (Ludwig and Reynolds, 1988) to determine the similarity in diets\nbetween ethnic groups taken in pairs. As a descriptive statistic, similarity coefficients can be quite",
    "Page_78": "useful in measuring dietary overlap. The values range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no overlap\nbetween types of foods eaten by ethnic groups (if ethnic group A ate only A foods and ethnic group B\nate only B foods) and 1 indicates complete overlap between ethnic groups (if ethnic groups A & B ate\nthe same proportion of A and B foods).\nThe formula for similarity coefficients for ethnic groups A & B is as follows: Similarity\nCoefficient AB = 1 - V[2(1-ccosAB)] / V[2]; where the chord cosine (ccos) is computed by: ccosAB =\n ∑ XiA XiB / V[ ≥ XiA² ≥ XiB² ] and where XiA is the number of foods from ethnic group i consumed by\npeople of ethnic group A, and XiB is the number of foods from ethnic group i consumed by people of\nethnic group B.\nChord distances were computed because these put greater importance on relative proportions\nof foods in various ethnic groups and less importance on the absolute quantities (Ludwig and Reynolds,\n1988). Bootstrapping was used (Resampling Stats, 2004) to determine 95% confidence intervals (CIs)\nbetween values (Dixon, 2001; Efron and Tibshirani, 1993). It does this by randomly resampling from a\nsample distribution similar to the original sample. It has been estimated that at least 1000 resamplings\nmust be conducted in order to determine 95% CIs (Efron, 1987). It is important to note that this\nanalysis is very robust at small sample sizes.\nEast Oxford Pilot Data\nThe pilot data set being used to test the method was collected in East Oxford UK in 1994. A\nconvenience sample of 163 children between the ages of 9 and 12 years was recruited to complete 4-7\nday food diaries. Classes were chosen based upon the willingness of class teachers to have the students\ncomplete the food diaries. Children were instructed to complete the food diaries throughout the day by\nfilling in all foods and drinks as they were ingested. Eight children were excluded from the analyses\nbecause they did not submit at least four completed days of food intake. The final sample size was\n155.\nChildren were classified by ethnic groups based on parent report of ethnic origins, teacher's\nreport of ethnic origins or child report of ethnic origins. Although most of the ethnic minority children\nwere first or second generation, data on this and other measures of acculturation were not uniformly\ncollected at the time of the study.\nCoding of the foods was conducted on foods ingested on three days during the week and one\nweekend day. Most of the foods in the diaries were categorized as ethnic dishes rather than as\nindividual food items. Foods were classified as Pakistani, West Indian or European (British) using\nseveral references from the literature. For example, foods such as fish and chips, crisps and biscuits\nwere categorized as “European,” foods such as chicken creole and spicy coconut bean dishes were\ncategorized as “W. Indian\" and foods such as chapattis, pakorahs or ghee were classified as\n\"Pakistani.” Ethical approval was provided by the University Ethics Officer at Oxford Brookes\nUniversity.\nRESULTS\nEthnic groups\nThe ethnic makeup of our final sample of 155 children is shown in Table 1. Mixed ethnic\ngroups are also included in the analyses. In references to a mixed group, the first name is the ethnicity\nof the children's mothers (female symbol) and the second name is the ethnicity of the children's fathers\n(male symbol). There was only one subject with a Pakistani mother and British father, and no subjects\nwith a British mother and Pakistani father, hence no analyses were conducted on these ethnic mixes.\nClassification of most frequently consumed foods\nClassification of the most frequently consumed foods is shown in Table 2. In many instances,\nfoods were categorized as ethnic dishes rather than as individual food components. It was possible for\nfoods to be classified in more than one ethnic category. This occurred in those cases where the food\n item is traditionally eaten by more than one ethnic group. For example, when a Pakistani child\nrecorded aubergine it was categorized as a Pakistani food for that child, whereas when an indigenous\nBritish child recorded aubergine it was categorized as “European/British.\" The percentage of ethnic\nfoods recorded for each ethnic group or mix is shown in Figure 1.",

    "Page_80": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 80\n Previous research has demonstrated clear relationships between acculturation level and dietary\nhabits. Among African Americans ranked by acculturation level, those who are less acculturated tend\nto eat higher fat diets, and less fruits, vegetables and dairy products than those who are more\n   o s       \ndiets higher in fat and lower in fruits and vegetables whereas those less acculturated eat a more\ntraditional diet that incorporates greater amounts of fruits and vegetables (Park et al, 2005).\nRecommendations to encourage healthful dietary patterns and to discourage less healthful patterns will\ndepend in part upon degree of acculturation.\nThe similarity coefficient analyses of the pilot data found that the diet of W. Indies children\nwas more similar to the British than the diet of the Pakistani children (similarity coefficients 0.402 vs.\n0.263 respectively; p < 0.05; Table 3). However, these findings do not allow us to conclude with\ncertainty that the W.

Individuals may have already been eating diets with some overlap between their own and the\nwhether the similarity in diets has changed and as such, to determine the degree of dietary\nacculturation.\n In the case of mixed groups, the mother's ethnicity appears to have a stronger influence on \ntypes of foods eaten by the children than does that of the father (Table 3).

Indies foods in their diets. Children solely of W. Indies\norigin incorporated the highest proportion of W. Indies foods in their diets (Figure 1).

In this research, we do not know who the primary caregiver was in each household of mixed\nethnicity and can only conjecture that it was the mother.  Further research into how ethnicity and\ngender of primary caregivers influence children's diets during the acculturation process may help shed\nlight on these findings.\nFigure 1.

MCNAUGHTEN, P.C.H. MOREL and J. COAD\n Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University\nPrivate Bag 11222, Palmerston North\nABSTRACT\n Iron deficiency is relatively common in young women and several dietary factors are known\nto influence iron bioavailability and status. The aim of this study was to assess the dietary intakes and\niron status of non vegetarian women aged 18-40 years living in the Manawatu region. Exclusion\n criteria included pregnancy or breastfeeding in the past 12 months, smoking, high alcohol consumption\nand recent blood donation. Dietary intakes were estimated using a 24 hour recall. A non validated\nfood frequency questionnaire was used to determine the intake of foods containing iron or factors\nknown to enhance or inhibit iron absorption. Weight and height were measured. Biochemical iron\nstatus was determined using serum ferritin (SF) and haemoglobin (Hb). Of the 45 women recruited, 2\nwomen (4.4%) had iron deficiency anaemia (SF<12 μg/L and Hb<120g/L) and 2 women (4.4%) had\ndepleted iron stores (SF<20 μg/L). All other women had normal iron stores (SF>20μg/L). The median\n          s   \nintakes were 14.21±7.15mg and 13.65mg. 20 women (44.4%) consumed less than the Recommended\nDietary Intake of 12-16mg iron per day. These findings are similar to those of the National Nutrition\nSurvey where 4 - 7% of menstruating women had low iron stores, despite a much higher estimated\nprevalence of inadequate intakes.\n Multiple regression analysis showed that SF was positively\nassociated with age and total dietary iron intake and negatively associated with tea and Vitamin C\nintake. Age explained 16.0% (p<0.001) of the variation (partial coefficient of determination; partial\nR?) in SF, iron 8.4% (p<0.03), Vitamin C 8.0% (p<0.005) and tea 8.2% (p<0.03). No statistically\nsignificant relationship was found between SF and daily energy, protein, haem iron, vitamin A, fibre,\ncalcium or coffee intake (p>0.05).\nINTRODUCTION\nIron deficiency anaemia has severe health consequences while iron deficiency without\nanaemia has been linked to delayed cognitive development (Grantham-McGregor and Ani, 2001) and\nreduced work capacity (Haas and Brownlie, 2001). In New Zealand low iron stores, iron deficiency\nand iron deficiency anaemia mainly affect women aged 15 to 44 years (Russell et al., 1999). A New\nZealand study found that factors associated with an increased risk of mild iron deficiency (SF 12-\n20ug/L and normal Hb) in women of child bearing age included high menstrual blood loss, recent\n) nod u u  go  mon e pu xun ss poq mo e sp ssou p oo\net al., 2001). Other risk factors for iron deficiency include high parity, previous diagnosis of iron\ndeficiency anaemia, low iron intakes (including vegetarian and vegan diets) and the use of intra-uterine\ncontraceptive devices which induce blood loss (Ministry of Health, 2003). There are a number of\ndietary factors known to influence the absorption of iron in the body. Haem iron found in meat\nproducts is better absorbed (~10-40%) (Hallberg et al., 1997) than the non haem iron found in meat and\nplant foods (~1-15% absorbed) (Hunt, 2003). Several dietary factors influence the absorption of non\nhaem iron. Ascorbic acid and meat are strong enhancers of non haem iron absorption, while\npolyphenols, phytates, calcium and some proteins inhibit non haem iron absorption. The aims of this\nstudy were to assess the dietary intakes and iron status of non vegetarian women aged 18-40 years of\nage living in the Manawatu region, and to determine which dietary factors influenced iron status.\nMETHODS\nSubjects were recruited from the Manawatu region between August 2004 and September 2005\nas part of a larger study. The study was advertised through posters, local newspapers and a radio\ninterview. Interested subjects were sent an information sheet explaining the study and were asked to\ncontact the researcher if wanting to take part in the study. Exclusion criteria included being vegetarian",
    "Page_83": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 83\nor vegan, allergies to iron containing products, donation of blood in the past 12 weeks, smoking, a high\n alcohol intake (>2 glasses of wine or 1 pint of beer/day), pregnancy or breastfeeding in the past year, or\nplanning to become pregnant in the next 6 months. All subjects took part in a dietary interview and\nhad their iron status assessed. Written informed consent was obtained at the initial dietary interview.\nSubjects were asked to describe their activity levels and use of supplements. Standing height and body\nweight were measured. Dietary intake was assessed using a 24 hour recall, with subjects recalling their\nfood intake from the previous day. The booklet “Food Portion Sizes: A Photographic Atlas” (Nelson et\nal., 2002) was used to help estimate portion sizes. A non validated food frequency questionnaire was\nused to determine subject's intake of foods containing iron and foods known to enhance or inhibit iron\nabsorption. Dietary intakes were analysed using FoodWorks Professional Edition Version 4.00. All\nsubjects had a blood test taken at MedLab Central in Palmerston North. Biochemical iron status was\ndetermined on a non-fasting venipuncture blood sample using SF and Hb. Subjects with an abnormal\nC-Reactive Protein level had their bloods retested at a later stage. Subjects were sent a letter and\nexplanation informing them of their blood test results. This project was reviewed and approved by the\nManawatu-Whanganui Human Ethics Committee and the Massey University Human Ethics\n(Minitab Inc, 2003).\nRESULTS\nA total of 53 women were recruited over a 13 month period. Blood results were available for\n45 of these women. The mean age of this group was 25.6±6.6years and the mean BMI 23.2±2.7. Two\nwomen (4.4%) had iron deficiency anaemia (SF<12μg/L and Hb<120g/L) and two women (4.4%) had\ndepleted iron stores (SF<20μg/L). All other women had normal iron stores (SF>20ug/L). The mean\nand median SF levels were 42.24±20.89ug/L and 39ug/L respectively. The daily mean and median\niron intakes were 14.21±7.15mg and 13.65mg, both which met the RDI of 12-16mg iron / day. Eight\nwomen (17.7%) did not meet the United Kingdom's lower reference nutrient intake for iron of 8mg\niron/day. Twenty women (44.4%) consumed less than 12mg iron per day and a further 10 women\n(22.2%) consumed less than 16mg iron per day. Multiple regression analysis showed that SF was\npositively associated with age and total dietary iron intake and negatively associated with tea and\nVitamin C intake. Age explained 16.0 % (p<0.001) of the variation (partial coefficient of\n(00>d) %78 5t pe (sooo>d) %08 5 u (oo>d) %t8 uo1 1s ! ( 1ed uon\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between SF and daily energy, protein, haem iron,\nvitamin A, fibre, calcium or coffee intake (p>0.05).\nDISCUSSION\nThe incidence of iron deficiency and depleted iron stores was lower than women in other New\nZealand studies, but the incidence of iron deficiency anaemia was similar (Fawcett et al., 1998; Russell\net al., 1999; Heath et al., 2001） In a Dunedin study of women aged 18-40 years, 2% had iron\ndeficiency anaemia (SF<12μg/L and Hb<120g/L), 4% had iron deficiency (SF<12μg/L, >40μmol zinc\nprotoporphyrin/mol haem) and 19% had mild iron deficiency (SF<20ug/L) (Heath et al., 2001). Six\npercent of women aged 19 to 24 years in the National Nutrition Survey had low iron stores or iron\ndeficiency (<12μg/L) and 1% had iron deficiency anaemia (SF<12μg/L and Hb<120g/L). For women\naged 25-44 years, the figures were 10 and 2% (Russell et al., 1999). The lower incidence of depleted\niron stores in our subjects may have been due to the exclusion of subjects who had donated blood in the\npast 12 weeks, the exclusion of vegetarians and a higher intake of dietary iron. Recent blood donation\n(in the past 4 months) is a risk factor for mild iron deficiency (Heath et al., 2001) and blood donors\nhave a lower SF concentration than non blood donors (Leggett et al 1990; Brussard et al., 1997).\nVegetarian females tend to have lower SF concentrations than non vegetarian females, but do not\nappear to have a higher incidence of iron deficiency anaemia (Hunt, 2003). This may be due to a\nhigher level of dietary iron absorption in vegetarians. The daily mean iron intake of 14.21±7.15mg was\nhigher than that of the National Nutrition Survey (10.8 and 10.5mg for females aged 19-24 and 25-44\n years respectively) (Russell et al., 1999) and higher than that in a study with women of a similar age\ngroup (10.7mg) (Heath et al., 2001).\nTotal dietary iron intake was the only dietary factor to show a statistically significant positive\nrelationship with SF concentration. This finding is supported by two large European studies (Galan et",
    "Page_84": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 84\nal., 1998; Preziosi et al., 1994), however, most studies have not found this association (Galan et al.,\n1985; Razagui et al., 1991; Brussard et al., 1997; Rangan et al., 1997; Heath et al., 2001). Haem iron\nintake had no effect on the iron status in this group. Several studies have found iron status to be\npositively correlated with haem iron and meat intake (Leggett et al., 1990; Brussard et al., 1997;\nRangan et al., 1997; Galan et al., 1998; Heath et al., 2001). This finding may have been more\nsignificant if we had included vegetarians in our study population.\nTea and vitamin C intake were negatively associated with iron intake. In single meal studies,\nthe addition of tea to a meal strongly inhibits non haem iron absorption (Hurrell et al., 1999), while\nVitamin C increases non haem iron absorption, but only when taken at the same time as the meal (Cook\nand Monsen, 1977).  Negative associations have been found between serum ferritin and tea\nconsumption (Galan et al., 1985), however, a meta-analysis found that tea consumption does not\nappear to affect iron status in populations who have an adequate iron status (Temme and Van\nHoydonck, 2002). The majority of studies in young women have not shown any association between\ntotal daily ascorbic acid intake and iron status (Galan et al., 1985; Preziosi et al., 1994; Rangan et al.,\n1997; Galan et al., 1998; Heath et al., 2001) and no study has found Vitamin C intake to be negatively\nassociated with iron status. Razagui et al. (1991) found that daily Vitamin C intake was less important\nthan the amount of Vitamin C consumed at meal times in determining iron status. This may partly\nexplain our findings.\n No statistically significant relationship was found between SF and daily energy, protein, haem\niron, vitamin A, fibre, calcium, alcohol or coffee intake. There were several limitations to this study.\nWe did not consider the effect of blood loss through menstruation on iron status (Heath et al., 2001;\nHarvey et al., 2005) and a 24 hour recall may not provide an accurate or valid representation of what an\nindividual normally eats. In addition, errors may occur through reliance on memory, over or\nunderestimation of food intakes or recording errors. A diet record or a validated food frequency\nquestionnaire may have been more appropriate to use to estimate dietary iron intake. Our method of\nrecruiting was based on subjects volunteering for the study, which may have had an influence on the\nresults.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThank you to all the participants who took part in this study and the Meat Biologics\nConsortium for funding this study.\nREFERENCES\nBrussard, J.H., Brants, H.A.M., Bouman, M. and Lowik, M.R.H.

Darragh² and A.Rowan²\n'Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University, and Fonterra Research Centre\nPalmerston North, New Zealand\nABSTRACT\n Obesity is increasingly being recognized as a significant health challenge facing all ages of the\npopulation and it is a risk factor for several chronic disorders. The inclusion of foods in our diet that\nmay enhance energy expenditure or improve satiety could be a practical way to maintain a stable body\nweight or assist in achieving weight loss. Protein is a satiating nutrient, and literature evidence suggests\nthat when offered un-restricted in either animal or human studies, total dietary intake will be lower with\na high protein diet compared to a diet rich in carbohydrates or lipids. The intent of this review is to\nshed some light on the role of protein and high-protein diets on satiety and bodyweight regulation with\nparticular reference to dairy proteins. Carefully conducted clinical studies are needed to firmly ascertain\nthe effect of dairy proteins on body weight maintenance, to assess their potential to assist in weight-loss\nefforts and to ascertain dose-response relations and mechanisms of action.\nINTRODUCTION\n Obesity is increasingly being recognized as a significant health challenge facing all ages of the\npopulation and may soon replace smoking as the number one cause of preventable death (Peters et al.,\n2003). Moreover, it is a risk factor for several chronic disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular\ndisease, hypertension, sleeping apnoea, osteoarthritis of weight-bearing joints, reduced fertility,\nasthma, and some cancers (Rippe et al., 1998) and hence, effective treatment of obesity can lead to a\nreduction of risk factors for these diseases and may result in decreased morbidity and mortality. The\netiology of obesity is multifactorial. Genetic, environmental, metabolic, and behavioral issues may all\ncontribute to the development of obesity (Rippe et al., 1998). The culture of over-eating and sedentary\nlifestyle is compounding the effects of a dietary profile that contains a large percentage of energy-dense\nprocessed and conventional foods (WHO, 1998). Another change that has aligned with the current\nobesity crisis in children and younger adults is the reduction in milk consumption with one study\nshowing that between 1965 and 1996, milk intake decreased in American adolescents by 36%\n(Cavadini et al., 2000).\nCurrently, there is no functional food available for obesity, such as there is for cardiovascular\ndisease or cancer (St-Onge, 2005) and hence efficient, effective and satisfying treatments are required.\na workable solution to this health challenge is to be found. One area identified as showing potential is\nthe possibility of creating food choices that, through physiological modulation, can induce greater\nsatiety, and therefore reduce intake.\nIt is well known that if body weight is to remain stable over time, energy intake (food intake)\nmust match energy expenditure (the sum of metabolic activity and physical exercise) over long\ndurations. Any chronic deviation from this equilibrium will result in weight gain or loss (Woods,\n2005). The objective of the present review was to shed light on the role of protein and high-protein\ndiets on satiety and bodyweight regulation, and in particular the role dairy proteins may play in\ninducing satiety.\nEffects of proteins, carbohydrates and lipid on food intake and body weight management\nThe macronutrients protein, carbohydrate and fat exert different satiating efficiencies with\nprotein being the most satiating and fat the least satiating (Westerplantenga et al., 1999; Anderson and\nMoore, 2004). The relationship between perception of satiety and metabolic rate, with varying\nmacronutrient composition, was assessed in man in a controlled situation over 24 h in a respiration\nchamber (Westerplantenga et al., 1999). Satiety and fullness were significantly higher in subjects on\nthe high protein/high carbohydrate diet, than on the high fat diet, while hunger, appetite, desire to eat,",
    "Page_87": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 87\nand estimated quantity to eat, were significantly lower. Moreover, a higher diet-induced thermogenesis\n(DIT) with a high protein/high carbohydrate diet, compared to the DIT with high fat diet was observed\nand that satiety was positively related to 24 h DIT. Increased satiety on a high protein diet, under\nsimilar energy intake conditions was also shown in the longer term, during a weight\nmaintenance/weight regain period (Westerplantenga et al., 2004).\nThe impact of high protein diets on body-weight loss have been assessed in different studies\nobese subjects was examined.  Weight loss and fat loss were significantly higher in the high protein\ngroup, most likely due to a lower energy intake (Skov et al., 1999). On the other hand, Due et al.\n(2004) conducted a follow-up study and found that after 12 months weight loss was not significantly\ngreater among subjects in a high protein group, but they had a greater reduction in intra-abdominal\nadiposetissue.\nA stronger short-term satiety effect of protein, compared with that of fat and carbohydrate, is\nevidenced by the delay in time at which food is requested after a protein load. For example, when\nyoung men were fed ad libitum lunch followed 4 h later by mandatory snacks containing the same\namount of energy but were either high in protein (77% of energy), fat (58% of energy), or carbohydrate\n(84% of energy), the dinner requests were delayed the longest, by 60 min, on the day that a high\nprotein snack was consumed, while requests were only delayed by 35 min when a high carbohydrate\nsnack was consumed and by 25 min on the day that a high fat snack was consumed by the subjects\n(Marmonier et al., 2000).\n In another study where the subjects were fed a low fat (30% of energy) diet containing either\n25% or 12% of energy as protein, the subjects ate less on the high-protein diet and it was concluded\nthat this was due to the enhanced satiety caused by the high-protein diet (Skov et al., 1999). In\naddition, the subjects on the 25% protein diet had a greater reduction in body weight than their\ncounterparts consuming the 12% protein diet. Layman et al. (2003) conducted a study in which women\nwere given diets containing different carbohydrate to protein ratios for 10 weeks and found that women\nwho consumed a diet with a carbohydrate to protein ratio of 1:4 showed similar weight loss but greater\nsatiety than those eating a diet containing a carbohydrate to protein ratio 3:5 and thus the authors\nprovides further evidence on the role of protein in contributing to satiety.\nIn addition to promoting fat loss, high protein diets maintain lean body mass and a relatively\nhigh rate of metabolism, which is a major component of total energy expenditure (Layman et al.,\nlimit weight regain after a weight loss of 7.5% in moderately overweight subjects and found that\nsubjects who consumed 18% of their energy as protein regained less weight during 6-12 months weight\nmaintenance (0.8 kg), compared with subjects who consumed 15% of their energy intake as protein (3\nkg). In addition, the body mass regained in the protein group consisted only of fat-free mass while in\n   s  s    n s  s    o \nobserved a greater increase in post-absorptive satiety in the protein group during weight maintenance,\nalthough their energy intake did not differ significantly from that of the control group and this higher\npost-absorptive satiety was attributed to increased thermogenesis.\nOnly a few studies have been conducted in order to determine the role of protein source on\nfeeding response in humans, with conflicting results. It has been found, for example that food intake\nsuppression in the next hour of feeding is greater following gavage with whey compared with egg-\nalbumin and soy protein (Morgan, 1998) and this difference in activity was attributed to physiological\n    d  e o   a    d g  o  \nfed an equivalent amount of protein as either beef or chicken (Uhe et al., 1992). In contrast, some\nstudies report that protein source in a mixed meal is not a factor in food intake suppression at a later\nmeal (Lang et al., 1999).\nImpact of milk and other dairy products on satiety and body weight regulation\n Milk proteins (whey and casein) appear to differ in their effects on food intake (for more\n details see Anderson and Moore, 2004). In one study, monkeys fed a liquid diet using a system that\nallowed manipulation of the intragastric diet, ate 25% fewer calories when the intragastric diet was\n50% casein compared to a 14% reduction in calorie intake with a 50% whey diet (Hannah et al., 1990).",
    "Page_88": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 3088\nMany reasons for these differences were hypothesized such as the peptide products derived from the\ndietary protein and their physiological effects preabsorptively, where whey protein rapidly enters the\n       o  s   d     \ndegraded peptide (Boirie et al., 1997). Mahe et al. (1996) reported that the difference between whey\nand casein is largely attributed to the clotting and precipitation of the casein (unlike the soluble whey\nprotein) in the acidic media of the stomach, giving it longer exposure to gastric peptic hydrolysis. Hall\net al. (2003) conducted two studies in order to investigate the effects of casein and whey milk proteins\n  psod uo p ‘ss pu nu go sh aons pun  o uo\n           rs\nconcentrations of factors known to contribute to satiety including amino acids, glucose-dependent\ninsulinotropic polypeptide, glucose-like peptide-1 and CCK.\n In addition to milk proteins, there is increasing evidence that dairy calcium may play a role in\nbody weight regulation (Zemel, 2002). It is proposed that intracellular calcium plays a role in\nadipocyte metabolism and that its concentrations are modulated by calcitrophic hormones. An increase\nin calcium intake in foods would down-regulate 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which would result in a\ndecrease in the absorption of calcium into adipocytes and pancreatic islet cells. Within the adipocyte,\nintracellular calcium increases fatty acid synthase transcription and inhibits lipolysis. Within the\npancreas, intracellular calcium stimulates insulin release, which further acts to inhibit lipolysis and\nstimulate fatty acid synthase transcription. Therefore, any reduction in intracellular calcium would lead\nto a reduction in lipogenesis and the stimulation of lipolysis (Zemel, 2003). The higher activity of dairy\ncalcium compared to elemental calcium may be attributed to the presence of other compounds within\ndairy products that act in concert with dietary calcium to produce antiobesity effects. Such compounds\nthat have been proposed are whey proteins, conjugated linoleic acid, and branched-chain amino acids\n(Zemel,2003).\nRecently, a clinical trial has been conducted to examine whether dairy or elemental calcium\nsupplementation enhanced weight loss in obese men and women (Zemel et al. 2004). At the end of the\nweight-loss period, subjects in the low-dairy, high-calcium, and high-dairy groups lost 6.4%, 8.6%, and\n10.9% of body weight, respectively. Fat-mass loss followed the same trend: the low-dairy, high-\ncalcium, and high-dairy groups lost 8.1%, 11.6%, and 14.1%, respectively, of total fat mass. Fat loss\nfrom the abdominal region represented 19% of the total fat loss in subjects in the low-dairy group and\n50.1% and 66.2% for those in the high-calcium and high-dairy groups, respectively. The authors\nconcluded that calcium particularly that from dairy products can enhance weight loss in obese persons.\nA RAT model formeasuring satiety and preliminary results\nDifferent animal models have been used to measure the satiating effect of various diets. One\nmodel developed by Froetschel et al. (2001) and found to be very reliable involves providing rats with\na premeal 20-30 minutes prior to their daily meal and assessing the impact of that premeal on\nsubsequent food intake. Critical to the success of this model is adaptation of the rats to a daily feeding\nregimen that restricts their access to food to a given period of time, thus ensuring that the rats will\nbegin feeding as soon as the food is offered. This model has been used successfully at Massey\nUniversity, with minor modifications, to determine the satiating impact of premeals of various dietary\ns e (sn - N  : m  a : ) x   \nwas conducted to determine whether milk proteins, given shortly before the onset of a meal, would\ninfluence total daily food intake. Female rats aged six weeks were housed individually in hanging\no p l  e   I i  o a e m i e u s s ss -\nand had free access to water throughout the study. All rats were habituated to the same 20-h\n93 diet) was made available to each rat for a total of four hours (1000 - 2000h; 2 hours in light cycle,\n x p pno  e d on n   (    sor z \nresponse at feeding and emphasize gastric mechanisms of intake regulation (Froetschel et al., 2001).\n The rats were given a premeal of 1ml of fluid, in which was suspended the milk protein to be\n  e n ( n g q n    a  n   ad s s\nsilicon rubber tube attached to a 1-ml syringe. So that the rats are comfortable with this procedure,\nduring the 7 day adaptation period the rats were handled daily, and for the last three days of the\nadaptation period, premeals of sterile water were gavaged into each rat once a day prior to the meal\nbeing offered. For the remainder of the study rats were put through a design with three experimental\nblocks. Each block tested three milk protein groups (n=10 per group) against a control group (n=10).",
    "Page_89": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 3089\nThe pre-meal was given to each rat 20 minutes before the normal mealtime, and impact of the pre-meal\nfor a period of four days. Food intake was determined by the difference in weights of food cups before\nand after each feeding period and corrected for spillage. A wash-out of three days was scheduled\nbetween each test period. On the wash-out days, the rats did not receive any pre-meal, but continued\nwith the four-hourly meal regimen.\nDuring the adaptation period, there were no between-group differences in food intake, water\nintake and body weight (data not shown). All rats consumed their diets as expected and demonstrated\nacceptable weight gains. Transition from the normal diet (pelleted chow) to a powdered diet induced a\nrapid depression in food intake during the first 3-5 days and then gradually adapted to the new diet. The\npowdered food was used in preference to pelleted chow because its consistency minimized spillage,\nthereby preventing animal from removing food from the feed for consumption at a later time.\n The gavaging technique guaranteed that each rat received orally a define amount of load and\nprevented any issues arising because of palatability differences in the pre-meal. Nine milk protein\nmixtures were tested and four of them (MP2, MP4, MP8, and MP9; Figure 1) showed a satiety effect as\nevidenced by their ability to reduce food intake by 13-17% (P<0.05-0.01) compared with the rats given\nwater as a placebo.\n25\nreduction in food intake\n20\n15\n10\n5\n%\nMP'Z\nMP3\nMP4\nMPb\nMP8\nMP\nMilkproteins\nFigure 1.

The %\nreduction in food intake (FIR%; satiety effect) was calculated by using the following equation:\n% FIR = [Food Intake (Control) - Food Intake (Protein Pre-meal)] x 100\nFood Intake (Control) x 100\n The reduction in food intake, observed over four hours in rats given a preload of milk proteins\nin comparison to rats in a control group given the same preload volume of water, has led to the\nconclusion that the decrease in food intake was mainly the consequence of a satiating effect of the\nproteins rather than simply a stomach distension effect.\nRecently St-Onge (2005) reported that the inclusion of foods or the replacement of habitual\nfoods with others that may enhance energy expenditure (EE) or improve satiety could be a practical\nway to maintain a stable body weight or to assist in achieving weight loss; such foods may act as\nfunctional foods in body weight control. Although the precise mechanisms which underlie the satiating\neffects of proteins are not fully understood, they may trigger receptors for amino acids which have been\ndetected in the wall of the upper intestine (Mei 1992). The afferent fibres from these receptors may\ninform certain brain centres that a source of energy and/or a specific nutrient has been ingested.\nAlternatively, such receptors may play a role in inducing satiety by triggering the release of hormones\nsuch as cholecystokinin (CCK), which might act directly at the central and/or peripheral levels to",
    "Page_90": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 90\nstimulate pancreatic juices and reduce gastric emptying. Other post-absorptive metabolic effects of\namino acids must also be taken into account, together with direct central signals associated with amino\nacids. Amongst the metabolic factors which may be responsible for a reduction in food intake during\nhigh-protein feeding, two main hypotheses have been suggested: an elevated plasma-free amino acid\nconcentration (Morens et al., 20o1） and an increased metabolic rate resulting from the marked\nthermogenesis induced by ingesting amino acids, a mechanism which underlies several important\nhypotheses (energetic, metabolic, ischymetric) concerning the control of food intake (Even et al.,\n2000).\nAccording to Woods and his collegues (1998, 2005) there are two types of signals that\ninfluence food intake and energy expenditure: signals generated during meals that influence the\nsensations of satiation (i.e., fullness, or signals that contribute to the decision to terminate an ongoing\nmeal) and satiety (i.e., signals that function to prolong the interval until hunger or a drive to eat\nreappears) and these signals are collectively called “satiety signals,” and the prototypical example is\nCCK. The second category includes hormones whose secretion is proportional to the amount of fat in\nthe body, and it includes insulin from the pancreatic islets and leptin from adipose tissue, stomach and\nelsewhere. These hormones are transported from the circulation into the brain through the blood-brain\nbarrier, and once inside the brain they interact with specific receptors on nerve cells.\nCONCLUSION\n Obesity is increasingly being recognized as a significant health challenge facing all ages of the\npopulation and it is a risk factor for several chronic disorders. Increasing the satiety of food and diets is\nchildren, and would help avoid the negative psychological ramifications of caloric-control and\n\"dieting\".\nProtein is a satiating nutrient, and literature evidence suggests that when offered un-restricted\nin either animal or human studies, total dietary intake will be lower with a high protein diet compared\nto diet rich in carbohydrates or lipids. Increased protein intake sustained weight maintenance by\nincreasing satiety, and therefore sustains reduced energy-intake diets, by favoring regain of fat-free\nmass at the cost of fat mass at a similar physical activity level. There is evidence that the high satiating\neffect of protein may be attributed to the ability of high protein diet to imply a high thermogenesis.\nMore studies are needed to explore the reasons behind the satiating activity of protein.\nREFRENCES\nAnderson, G.H. and Moore, S.E.

COAD and M.HOLZER\n Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University\nPrivate Bag 11222, Palmerston North.\nABSTRACT\n  n             \nwomen were trying to conceive and the remainder were not intentionally planning to become pregnant\nin the forthcoming 12-month period. 40% of all women had more than 30% body fat. Half of the\nwomen reported an undesirable high alcohol intake per occasion, though this was less common in\nwomen intending to conceive. Intake of various micronutrients  varied from  insufficient \nto\nwomen. About half the women planning pregnancy consumed folic acid supplements as recommended;\nthe remainder of women planning pregnancy stated they planned to take folic acid supplements when\ntheir pregnancy was confirmed.\nINTRODUCTION\nIncreasing evidence suggests that maternal nutrition and lifestyle factors during the\npreconceptual period can affect maternal (King 20o0) and potential infant health including the infant's\nlater risk of developing some adult-onset disease (Barker 2003). There is increasing recognition that\nbody composition of the mother can affect her fertility and the outcome of pregnancy (de Weerd et al\n 2003). Several lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and caffeine have a negative\neffect on fertility (Curtis et al 1997, Hakim et al 1998, Hassan & Killick 2004, Henriksen et al 2004,\nJensen et al 1998). Currently little information or support is available for women planning pregnancy\nin New Zealand. Before effective nutrition interventions can be planned or designed, it is important to\nknow the nutritional intakes of women who may become pregnant and the factors which affect their\nnutritional status and their beliefs about nutrition and lifestyle which might impact on conception and\npregnancy.\nMETHODS\nWe recruited a sample of convenience from the Manawatu area between April and December\n2004. The study design received ethical approval from Massey University Human Ethics Committee\nand prospective participants were recruited by advertisements in the press, on local radio and on\nvarious community notice boards. Subjects were women aged between 20 and 40 who were not\npregnant and had no known (declared) history of infertility. 101 women expressed interest in the study\nand asked for further information. 78 women volunteered to participate in the study; 47 women were\nnot deliberately intending to become pregnant and 31 were planning pregnancy.\nAnthropometric measurements including weight and height (using the BodPod weight scales\nand a Toleda stadiometer respectively), hip and waist circumference (using a Jobst tape) skinfold\nthicknesses (triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses using Holtain skinfold\ncalipers) and air-displacement plesthysmography (BodPod, Life Measurement Inc) were conducted.\nSubjects were also interviewed about their lifestyle using a structured interview which\nincluded questions about demographic characteristics (age, occupation, reproductive history), personal\nhealth and lifestyle factors. Nutritional intake was determined by 24-hour dietary recall using a\nphotographic atlas (Nelson et al 1997) to assess portion sizes and Xyris FoodWorks (version 3.02) to\nwomen planning pregnancy and 5 women not intending to become pregnant were excluded on the\ngrounds of underreporting intake. Nutritional intake was compared to the New Zealand National\nNutrition Survey (Russell et al 1999), the New Zealand nutritional recommendations (Truswell et al\n1990) and to Institute of Medicine recommendations (Institute of Medicine 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004).",
    "Page_93": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30  93\nRESULTS\nAlthough 31 of the 78 women recruited to the study defined themselves as planning\npregnancy, 21 women were actively planning pregnancy as soon as possible, were not using\ncontraceptives and had discussed their hopes for pregnancy with their partners. 10 of the subjects were\nplanning pregnancy within 12 months at the time of recruitment but were stil using contraception or\nhad not discussed their hopes with their partners.\nTable 1\nControl Group (n=47)\nPlanning pregnancy (n=31)\n26.6 ± 3.64 y\n30.9 ± 4.33 y\nAge\nPrevious pregnancy\n21.3%\n51.6%\nMean body fat\n28.3 ± 6.65%\n31.15 ± 7.47%\nLifestyle Factors\nThe percentage of women who smoked cigarettes was 6.4%, considerably less than the\nestimated 25% of all women who smoke in New Zealand (Barnett et al 2004). 2 women also indicated\nthat they were occasional smokers of marijuana. This low incidence of reported smoking probably\nreflects the high educational level of the subjects. All women but one agreed that women who are\ntrying to conceive should avoid smoking. 93% of all women in the study thought that women who were\ntrying to conceive should avoid alcohol. However, 89% of women not intending to become pregnant,\nand 71% of women planning pregnancy immediately, drank some alcohol (5.8 and 5.3 standard drinks\nper week respectively). Half the women not intending to become pregnant did not meet the ALAC\n(Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand) guidelines for alcohol intake per occasion; no more than 4\nstandard drinks per occasion (Alcohol Advisory Council, 2002). Women planning pregnancy tended to\nconsume alcohol more regularly throughout the week; again this may reflect the slightly higher mean\nage of this group.\nCoffee consumption in women planning pregnancy and women not planning pregnancy was\nsimilar (62% and 65%) but 13% of women planning pregnancy drank decaffeinated coffee (none of the\nwomen not intending to become pregnant drank decaffeinated coffee). 70% of all women thought\nwomen planning  pregnancy should avoid coffee; those women who did not drink any coffee were\nmore likely to think that coffee should be avoided at the time of conception and during pregnancy.\nAnthropometric measurements\n34.7% women had a BMI over 25 kg/m2 and 38.9% women had more than 30% body fat.\n There were slight differences between the body composition of women planning pregnancy and those\nnot intending to conceive but these differences are largely attributable to the difference in mean age of\nthe two groups of women. No difference was seen in the waist:hip ratio between the two groups. 53%\nof women in the study were not satisfied with their current weight and 41% of women were actively\ntrying to lose weight.\nNutrientIntake\n In general, the women in the study had nutrient intakes in excess of the mean intake from the\nNational Nutrition Survey, possibly reflecting their higher educational background and above average\nmean income. Purchase and consumption of fortified foods and vitamin and mineral supplements was\n              \nwomen planning pregnancy had a significantly lower energy intake from carbohydrate (53.4±8.2 vs.\n48.6± 6.8%; p<0.05) (and energy intake from fat was higher) because they were consuming less\ncomplex carbohydrates (monosaccharide and disaccharide intake was similar in both groups). The\nintake of saturated fat was similar in both groups (average of 46.3% of total fat intake). 78% of women\nagreed with the statement “I should eat less saturated fat'. On average, women consumed an average of\n 2.6 portions of fruit and 2.8 portions of vegetables per day.\nAbout half of all women took a daily nutrient supplement. None of the women not intending\nto become pregnant took a folic acid only supplement; supplements that were consumed had lower than\nthe recommended intake of folic acid for women in the periconceptual period. Women planning\n pregnancy used more supplements and 45% of these women planning pregnancy took a folic acid",

Predominant reasons for taking supplements were\nto prevent a dietary deficiency or sickness or because the woman felt tired or low. The consumption of\nnutrient supplements contributed to the wide range of micronutrient intakes of the women taking part in\nthe study. Excluding the contribution of supplements, the New Zealand recommendations were not met\nby 34% of women for folate, by 41% of women for iron, by 50% of women for vitamin A and by 50%\nof women for calcium.\nDISCUSSION\nThe women who took part in this study had a higher incidence of overweight/obesity\nstudy; the incidence of obesity is increasing (Ministry of Health 2004). Being overweight affects\nfertility (time to conception) (Mansour 2004) and outcome of pregnancy (Waller & Dawson 2005,\nCastro & Avina 2002). Generally, women in the study accurately judged their body fat, alcohol intake\nand consumption of saturated fat; however, behaviour did not reflect their stated concerns. Similarly, of\nthe women who were hoping to become pregnant all were either taking folic acid supplements or\nplanned to do so when they became pregnant. For those women not currently taking the recommended\nchange was confirmation of pregnancy. The results of this study are similar to the findings of the Dutch\nexplorative study which investigated dietary intake and lifestyle factors in women planning pregnancy\n(de Weerd et al 2003). It was reported that less than half the women planning pregnancy were taking a\nfolic acid supplement and intake of vitamin A, iron and some other micronutrients were particularly\nlow in about 50% of the subjects. Whilst it is known that awareness of nutritional and lifestyle issues\ndoes not necessarily affect behaviour (Croghan 2005, Shepherd 2005), some aspects of the lack of\nawareness of the importance of diet and behaviour before and at conception maybe related to lack of\nsupport and information. It is of concern that a large number of women appear not be preparing\nthemselves for pregnancy and are not fully aware of the importance of this periconceptual period for\nthe outcome of pregnancy.\nREFERENCES\nBarker, D.J.

Health and wellbeing is the\noutcome of a complex interaction of biology- genetic endowment, uterine environment and external\nfactors including nutrition. Research over the last two decades has provided a substantial amount of\ndata on possible influences of dietary factors on health, especially as regards chronic long effects\n(Simopoulos, 2005) dispersed in the scientific literature and discussed at seminars and conferences and\na basis for different dietary guide lines (Baghurst, 2003; Cooper and Zlotkin, 2003; Dwyer, 2001;\nSchneeman, 2003). How successfully has this information been disseminated to the general\npopulation? A large survey in Britain on changes in physical activity and dietary habits over an 8 year\nperiod in a 1958 cohort concluded that life style habits such as dietary intake were slow to change and\nthat current health promotion strategies may need to be supplemented with additional methods to\n achieve the desired outcomes (Parsons et al, 2005). A large American survey of army personnel\nreported that though physical activity goals were met improvement was needed to meet the nutrition\n goals (Yore et al, 2000). A report by the New Zealand Cancer Society reported that 66% NZ adults\nknow eating fruit and vegetables is important for health, but 48% do not consume the recommended 5+\nservings a day (Sullivan et al, 2004). Therefore the important questions- and challenges - are: Is the\ncorrect message being received? And, more importantly: Is it being acted on?\nNutrition behind our health\n In a nutritional context health promotion can be seen as the interface of behavioural\npsychology, educational theory and nutritional science and different terminology and theoretical\n        ss     \nEmpowerment, leading to active participation, is a key component of health promotion, defined as “the\nprocess which enable people to gain control over their health determinants in order to improve their\nenvironmental and psychosocial factors is health literacy. This is defined as “ the cognitive and social\nskills which determine the motivation and ability to gain access to information, and to understand and\ncritically use this information in ways which promote and maintain good health’ ( Nutbeam D, WHO\n1998) quoted in (Koelen and Lindstrom, 2005). .\n Therefore health literacy incorporates both nutritional understanding and efficacy\nan\nunderstanding of the relevant health implications of dietary choices, as well as the means to put this\ninto practice. This awareness is the first step towards participation, behaviour change, risk change and\ndisease change.\n So a crucial issue related to this is how effectively nutrition messages are\ncommunicated to the wider community. According to Blackburn (2005） “\"90 million Americans lack\nbasic skills needed to access, understand and use health information and services to make healthy\ndietary choices\".\n In the public arena, the importance of food and nutrition is increasingly recognised as a major\nfactor in short and long term health as well as fitness and performance by the community at large. That\nnutrition is news, is clear from biannual surveys on news stories about food and health and state by the\nCentre for Media and Public Affairs for the International Food Information Council Foundation, an\nAmerican based organization supported by food, beverage and agricultural industries. The same group\nidentified sources of nutrition information for consumers in recent years to be magazines (95%) and\nbooks (72%) compared to 25% for nutritionists or dieticians. A small pilot survey in New Zealand\nlikewise identified books, magazines and newspaper as well as family and friends as significant\nsources. In the use of nutritional supplements, the media have likewise been show to be important\n(Rowe and Toner, 2003). For the general public there are many books and articles in newspapers and\nmagazines on healthy eating as well as a huge diversity of information from the internet. The problem\nis that the nutrition messages often do not come from the professionals in the field. Adding to the\nconfusion is that they don't always appear to agree, even those that do come from the scientific",

Similar results have been reported with respect to cancer\n prevention dietary behaviour (Harnack et al, 1997). An Australian report noted that those with tertiary\neducation tended to know more about food and nutrition and appear to have healthier dietary habits\n(Worsley et al, 2004). In their study of 138 participants Crites et al concluded that health evaluations\nwere more strongly associated with attitudes for people with high nutritional knowledge (Crites and\nAikman, 2005). Over recent years in Europe, there is an increasing acknowledgement of the\nimportance of effective, informative and appropriate nutrition communication using different channels\nincluding family doctors (Koster et al, 2005; Truswell et al, 2005).\nConclusion\nAttitudes, belief systems, barriers, conflicting or/and confusing or/and misleading nutrition\nfor effective nutrition promotion.

Are functional foods more expensive and\ninevitably beyond the reach of families with lower incomes? How does the promotion of some foods as\nhaving an ‘extra benefit influence understanding of a “healthy diet'? Some insight into this question\ncan be provided by examination of products currently on the market and investigation of consumer\nperceptions. The response of the nutritionist needs to be debated.\nINTRODUCTION\n Nutrition research is identifying new ways to reduce disease risk and optimise health, but\nwill ‘cutting edge’ nutrition research improve health for all, or will it only benefit wealthy, health\nconscious people? In particular, can research in the fields of functional foods and nutrigenomics\nreduce health inequalities associated with socioeconomic status, or will such research only support the\nstatus quo, or perhaps lead to greater inequalities?\nInequalities in health associated with socioeconomic status are a global reality. In New\n Zealand, although death rates associated with a number of chronic diseases are falling across the\npopulation, inequality associated with socioeconomic status has remained and relative inequality has\nincreased (Ministry of Health, 2005). An example of this trend is illustrated in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Cardiovascular disease mortality rates by income and sex (Ministry of Health, 2005)\nCVD 25-77 years Males\nCVD 25-77 years Females\n700\n350\n600\n300\n500\n250\n400\n200\n300\n150\n200\n100\n100\n1981-84 1986-89 1991-94 1996-99\n1981-84 1986-89 1991-94 1996-99\nLowincome\n Medium income\nHigh income\nDiet has been implicated as one of the causes of premature death that can be realistically\naddressed. Since inability to access the medical sector has been cited as a barrier to health for some\npeople in lower socioeconomic groups diet would seem to be a particularly useful public health\nintervention towards the reduction of health inequities",
    "Page_100": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30100\nFunctional foods and nutrigenomics have been promoted as tools for improving public health\n(IFT, 2005; Jones, 2002;Darnton-Hill, 2004). While research has shown these to have great potential\nin terms of identifying and addressing disease risk it is not clear how accessible they will be to those of\nlower socio-economic status. At present, both are being offered—for a price-- by the private sector.\nGenetic profiling is expensive and is unlikely to be made available as part of freely accessible public\nhealth care (Chadwick,2004). Even if public money were made available for genetic profiling it has\nbeen argued that it may not be the wisest use of limited public health of funds (Chadwick, 2004).\nTo date promoting foods as functional is primarily an industry initiative, and doing so is a way\nto differentiate products, add value and increase profits (Holm, 2003; Euromonitor, 2003). A quick\nlook at the supermarket shelves in New Zealand shows that in some food categories those promoted as\nhaving a health benefit, e.g. margarine with added plant sterols and nutritionally differentiated milks,\ncost more than similar foods without the added nutritional “benefit'. It is unlikely that people with\nlower income will be purchasing these more expensive ^functional’ options within the food category\nResearch in the US has shown that people with low incomes are more likely to purchase generic brands\nand less expensive products within a product class (Ackbay & Jones, 2005) and Otago University\nassumes ” purchase of the “lowest priced item within each food category” when calculating “Basic\n2005). Thus the benefit of many functional foods is not likely to be obtained by those with low\nincomes.\nIf we accept that nutrigenomics and functional foods will not be accessible to the less\nprivileged members of society and so not directly benefit their health, then the question must be asked,\n'will they cause any harm?’ Mechanisms by which harm may be caused include:\na) diversion of scarce dollars away from research and public health interventions that are more likely to\nbenefit the broader population (Chadwick, 2004)\nb) distract people from core nutrition messages of (balanced diets (Holm, 2003; Mathers, 2000)\nc) increase the perception that healthy’ foods cost more, so that people who can not afford functional\nfoods or genetic analysis believe that a healthy diet is ‘out of their reach’ and hence disregard all\nnutrition messages\n In the remainder of this paper I will further examine these potential mechanisms for harm.\n Research dollars need to be used so that they achieve the most benefit for the population\n(Darnton-Hill, 2004). This is not to say that research should not address these new areas, but that we as\na research community have an obligation to ensure that a broad range of areas are researched, not just\nthose with clear ^commercial potential'.\n Health claims for foods, described as ‘the engine’ for functional foods, have been promoted\npartly as a way to educate the consumer (Holm, 2003). While there is some evidence that they can help\nraise consumer awareness to a small extent (ANZFA, 2000), research in Australia found that many\nnutrition related claims do not reflect important public health nutrition issues, e.g. “cholesterol free'\n(Williams et al, 2003.) Therefore it is important that public funding for nutrition promotion continue,\nor even increase, alongside of industry initiatives.\nexample from the point of view of nutrigenomics, general population recommendations do not make a\nlot of sense. For example, it would be ideal if all people could know if they individually will benefit\nto present information in the absence of this certainty. We need to maintain confidence in public health\nmessages in light of publicity about nutrigenomics.\nLikewise functional foods appear to be the antitheses of current nutrition education with its\n p o  so  e s   s s n soo s  n o s\nindicate that the benefit of the product occurs as ^part of a balanced diet', e.g. the health claims for\nfolate fortified foods are required by the Food Standards Code to include a statement related to the\nimportance of maintaining a varied diet (FSANZ, 2005a) In qualitative research commissioned by\nFSANZ most consumers felt that the inclusion of the term “healthy diet’ or “healthy, balanced diet' in a\nhealth claim was relevant (FSANZ, 2005). But the question remains as to whether consumers hear the\nentire message or focus on the food that is being promoted as a ^magic bullet'. The food industry has",
    "Page_101": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 101\nfar more money available for nutrition promotion than does the health sector, so it is possible that the\nhealth and nutrition messages from industry could overpower those from the health sector. There is\nsome evidence that US consumers experience information overload, leading to emphasis placed on less\n s s    sn s       \nsocio-economic spectrum, the fact is that people with less money to spend on food must make wiser\nfood choices (Department of Human Nutrition, 2005).\nTo date promotion of functional foods has come primarily from industry, with the associated\nmarketing aims and premium pricing.  Perhaps nutritionists should integrate information about\nfunctional foods into current dietary recommendations. Should we be promoting the functional\nproperties of whole foods as a way to promote variety in food groups? One of the few examples of\nrecognition of a ^functional food’ in nutrition education material is the inclusion of a glass of wine with\nthe food pyramid proposed by Willet and Stampfer (2003).\nThere is a perception amongst some of the population that “healthy foods cost more', e.g\nStrong (2005). Jetter and Cassidy (2005) showed this to be the case in areas of California. In New\nZealand the cost of fruit and vegetables is cited as a barrier to increasing consumption, and consumers\nin less affluent areas are less likely to meet recommended intakes of fruit and vegetables (Russel et al,\n1999). They are also less likely to consume trim milk, as opposed to standard milk? (Russel et al,\n1999).\nIn an attempt to examine the hypotheses that promotion of functional foods may distract\npeople from core nutrition messages and/or contribute to the perception that *healthy food costs more\nand hence leads to resignation by those on a limited income that a “healthy diet’ is unobtainable, I\ncarried out a small qualitative study in a rural area of the North Island (Weber, unpublished data).\na sa d   , pn   e ro nso,  s p  \nusing a questionnaire and in depth interviews with parents of primary school children. In this research,\npeople who reported difficulty in feeding their family ‘properly’ mentioned fruits, vegetables, dairy\n products and meat as being prohibitively expensive. They said they did not always purchase as much\nof these as they would like. Price was the main determinant of what they bought within a product\ncategory; health and nutritional aspects of the product were not part of the decision.\nNormally go for budget and whatever's on special\n In this group of people of people experiencing food stress? there did not appear to be much\nawareness of foods marketed as having a nutritional advantage, although they agreed that some foods\nmight be better nutritionally, e.g. those with the Heart Foundation tick. The foods with Heart\nFoundation tick were generally recognised as better nutritionally, but not affordable and so not part of\ntheir usual food purchase decision making.\nPeople who stated that they could feed their family properly also agreed that “healthy food\ncosts more', but they mentioned specialty oils and spreads, and brown bread as the healthy foods that\ncost too much. While they recognised some foods as “better' in terms of nutrition, their inability to\npurchase them was not seen as a barrier to feeding the family ^properly’ because these foods were not\nconsidered to be essential.\nIf I bought that [spread with omega 3s] then I wouldn't be able to buy something else. I'm on a tight\nbudget'\nVegetables spike in price sometimes, but you need to buy them.... Brown bread would be better, but...\nFoods with the Heart Foundation Tick were also considered to be “better' by this group also,\nThere was limited awareness of fortified foods currently for sale in New Zealand, but when\nneeded nutrients.\n2 Standard milk can be purchased at a lower unit price than trim milk, although there is no independent \nevidence that cost is the determinant of this choice.\n3 Food stress is used to refer to people who, in a questionnaire, indicated that they could not always\nafford to feed their family properly.",
    "Page_102": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30102\n\"but they're eating their vegetables, so they'll get fibre from them” (in response to question about fibre\nwhitebread)\n\"they get that from milk\" (in response to description of orange juice with added calcium)\nThese responses suggest a basic understanding of nutrition/food composition. Although the\nparents expressed scepticism about nutritionally enhanced products it remains to be seen if their basic\n  n         \nmessages.\nAll the parents interviewed described feeding the family properly as consisting of a diet\nincluding vegetables, fruits, meat, etc, in other words “basic foods'. Thus in this small sample the\nhypothesis that promotion of functional foods has distracted people from basic nutrition messages or\nlead them to believe a ‘healthy diet’ was ^out of reach' was not borne out. This may be partly due to\nthe low awareness of functional foods in this sample. The recognition of some foods as “better' but not\n'necessary’ may reflect the view that functional foods are a way to ^optimize diet' (Milner, 1999) or it\nmay be a way of justifying the food choices that they are able to make within their budget.\nInterestingly, the people who appeared to be under food stress were less likely to be aware of\nfunctional foods currently on the market. Thus, while promotion of functional foods may not detract\nfrom their diet in the near future it is also unlikely that health claims will be an efficient way to educate\nand influence this segment of society to improve nutritional status.\nIn conclusion, there are a number of ways that emerging research in functional foods and\nnutrigenomics may increase inequalities associated with socio-ecomoic status.  Nutritionists are\nmorally bound to ensure that the benefits of this research are obtained by both rich and poor, especially\nif government funds are used for the research (Darnton-Hill, 2004; Verschuren, 2002).\nMoral\nresponsibility can take the form of choosing appropriate areas of research, promoting research findings\nin ways to benefit the most people, involvement in policy decisions, e.g. decisions related to health\nclaims, and carrying out research into the impact of new technologies.\nOne opportunity for nutritionists to respond to this moral imperative is in relation to the\ndevelopment of Food Standards. The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code is soon to be altered\nfoods. It is also likely to lead to an increase of advertising messages with reference to nutrition and\nhealth. It is important that research examines how people incorporate this information into their view\nof a “healthy’ diet, especially the views of people who are currently socio-economically disadvantaged.\nWhile they have the most to gain from good nutrition, they are also most vulnerable.\nTim Lang (2005) in support of the New Nutrition Science Project wrote,\n\"it is a myth that nutrition science was ever neutral. Nutrition has made advances only when engaged\nwith society. Policy-makers have been weak in responding to evidence from nutritional science, but\nthis failure has also been due to nutrition lacking good champions, coherent organisations, and\npolitical will to lobby against and with powerful forces\"\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThank you to parents who completed the questionnaires and who gave of their time and shared\ntheir thoughts in interviews.

Rasch modelling analysis was used\nto rank these indices and produce a uni-dimensional measure of the severity of food insecurity. Three\ncategories of household food security were assigned: full/almost full security; moderate security and\nlow security. Using ANOVA (for adults) and linear mixed models (for the children's data to control\nfor clustering within households with multiple participants), food security category was associated with\nnutrient intakes and body weight status. NNS97 participants in the less food secure households had the\nhighest BMI, higher intakes of fat, vitamin B12 and lactose and the lowest intakes of glucose and\nfructose and vitamin C. CNS02 participants in the less food secure households had lower intakes of\ntotal sugars, vitamin A, β-carotene, vitamin B12 and calcium, and lactose.\nThese results are congruent with work reported in the United Kingdom and North America,\nhousehold food security status, and thence to determine nutrition and health correlates is of public\nhealth significance in New Zealand.\nINTRODUCTION\n The emergence of “hunger within developed countries with a plentiful food supply was first\ndescribed in the US in the 1980s. Radimer (Radimer, 1996; Radimer et al., 1990), used qualitative\nenvironment. Emerging from this work came the now currently accepted definition of food security:\naccess by all people, at alltimes, to enough appropriate food for an active healthy life (LSRO, 1990).\nThe components of food insecurity—-which has a number of manifestations (Parnell et al., 2001), with\ngreater or lesser impact on the life and health of those experiencing it—-have been well described by\nRadimer (Radimer, 1996). At the lowest level it may mean that food choices are less than optimal. At\nthe most severe level, those who are food insecure might access food by socially unacceptable means.\n Individuals living in fod insecure households are able to describe the coping strategies which they\nemploy.\n Strenuous efforts have been made to assess or measure, food insecurity in a valid way. In the\nUS, building on the work of Radimer, a large team of researchers, developed an 18-scale set of\nindicators of food insecurity, ranked them in order of severity and then developed four ^categories’ of\nfood insecurity, suitable to classify households (Hamilton et al., 1997).\nThe development of these ^categories’ of food insecurity (food secure; food insecure but\nhunger not evident; food insecure with moderate hunger; food insecure with severe hunger), further\nenabled researchers to examine the nutrition and health outcomes experienced by those experiencing\nvarying levels of 'severity' of food insecurity (Tarasuk et al., 1999; Vozoris et al., 2003). It is\ngenerally accepted that while there is some commonality in the experience of food insecurity across \ncountries or cultures, it is desirable that each population group develop their own food insecurity\ninstrument, particular to their food patterns and wider environment.\nNew Zealand context was carried out by J Reid (Reid, 1997). Eight items were identified—fewer than",
    "Page_105": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 105\nthe 18 chosen in the US. For the National Nutrition Survey (NNS97) these items were further\ndeveloped into eight indicator statements, presented to respondents and potentially applicable to their\nhousehold (or themselves in the case of a single person household). The prevalence of these eight\naspects or indicators of food insecurity in the New Zealand (NZ) population has been described for all\nhouseholds (Russell et al., 1999) and for households with children (Parnell et al., 2003).\nThe NNS97 was a voluntary cross-sectional survey of New Zealanders 15 years and above\n(n=4636). The ethical approval, survey design and methodology are described elsewhere (Russell et\nal., 1999). The CNS02 was a voluntary cross sectional school based survey of New Zealand children,\n 5-14 years (n=3276). The ethical approval, methodology and survey design are described in New\nZealand Food: New Zealand Children? (Parnell et al., 2003). As part of the survey interview, eight\nstatement indices of food insecurity for NZ households were placed before adult participants in the\nNNS97 and the adult care-givers of children in the CNS02, after an introductory paragraph was read to\nthem.\nStatements 1-8, as presented to respondents.\n1.\nI/we can afford to eat properly.\n2.\nFood runs out in my/our household due to lack of money.\n3.\nI/we eat less because of lack of money.\n4.\nThe variety of food I am/we are able to eat is limited by a lack of money.\n5.\n I/we rely on others to provide food and/or money for food for my/our household when\nI/we don't have enough money.\n6.\n I/we make use of special food grants or food banks when I/we do not have enough money\nfor food.\n7.\n I feel stressed because of not having enough money for food.\n8.\nI feel stressed because I can't provide the food I want for social occasions.\n Rasch analysis was performed on responses pertaining to households, where some food insecurity\nwas reported. The Rasch modelling approach took a set of attributes or items of the particular\nconstruct (food security) and:-\nExamined whether each of the items were unique, contributed meaningfully to the construct, and\ncould be ordered on a uni-dimensional scale (in order of difficulty).\nExplored the pattern of the responses to each of the items, described the patterns into which they\nfell and placed them on the same scale (Bond et al., 2001).\nThree categories of food security were then assigned:\neight indices of food insecurity and households responding to only one of the indices.\n2.\n Moderate food security\n3. Low food security: Households in this group were most likely to report ‘relying on others for\nfood or money for food, and that they had to use special food grants or a food bank, to acquire\nthe food they needed.\nThe Rasch analysis was deemed to be *successful', in that the relatively small number of indicators\nof food insecurity (eight), were able to be ranked or scaled with acceptable fit and separation. The\nresponses to the indicators exhibited acceptable ésubject reliability’ (Parnell, 2005).\nAssociations between the three assigned categories of household food security and the intakes of\nenergy and nutrients were explored by ANOVA for adults, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, Index of\nDeprivation (by place of residence), urban/rural location, level of education, income and household\nsize. For the children's data (to control for clustering within households with multiple participants) the\nassociations were explored using linear mixed models controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, Index of\nDeprivation, urban/rural location, and household size.",
    "Page_106": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 106\nIMPACTOFFOODSECURITYONNUTRIENTINTAKE\n In the NNS97, for NZ adults, households with lower food security had significantly higher fat\nintakes (all types), lower intakes of glucose; fructose; lactose; vitamins B6 and C, and higher intakes of\nlactose and vitamin B12.\nAs reported by the adult care-givers in household with children in the CNS02, lower\nhousehold food security was significantly associated with a lower intake of total sugars; lactose;\nvitamin A; β-carotene; vitamin B12; calcium.\nThe relationship between levels of intake of fat and cholesterol with degree of food security is\nunique to this study, with those in the least food secure households having the highest level of intake.\nFood insecurity appears to be a barrier to achieving recommended dietary guidelines for adult New\nZealanders; namely reducing the proportion of dietary energy from fat in particular, total fat\n(Department-of-Health, 1991). The lower levels of intake of fructose and glucose (largely supplied by\nfruits in the diet), of adults in food insecure households demonstrates that food insecurity works against\nachieving another important aim —— to increase the intake of fruits in the diet. A number of studies\nhave provided data illustrating this nutritional disadvantage of the food insecure (Dowler et al., 1995;\npopulation based, or use a fully validated instrument for the measurement of food security.\nSince the food patterns and relative costs of foods differ between countries and cultures it is to\nbe expected that food security status might be related to food and nutrient intake in a unique way\n(Drewnowski et al., 2004). Additionally, adults and children even within a country or culture do not\nsugars and lower in fat than NZ adults (Parnell et al., 2003; Russell et al., 1999).\nIn NZ, the nutrient intake of children is affected by the level of food security differently to\nthat of adults. The children in most food insecure households have lower intakes of lactose and\ncalcium (a marker of dairy product intake), whereas for lactose food insecurity is associated with the\nopposite relationship among adults. Children in food insecure households also have lower intakes of β-\ndiets for those in food insecure households. The nutrients affected are those which come from\nperishable foods: fruits, vegetables, dairy products.\nImpact of food security on Body Mass Index (BNI)\nFor NZ adults, but not children, adjusted mean BMI was lowest for those living in households\nwithin the fully/almost fully food secure category (28.7), compared to those moderately food secure\n(29.2), and those living in households which had the lowest food security (29.5).\nThe relationship between food security status and BMI for the adult (men and women)\npopulation of NZ is of interest. The results for women are congruent with the findings reported\nelsewhere; where overweight is lowest among the food secure (Townsend et al., 2001). However\nCanadian men in food insufficient households were found to be less likely to be overweight than their\ncounterparts in food sufficient circumstances (Vozoris et al., 2002). Explanations for an association\nbetween food security status and BMI are not immediately obvious. However, this study and other\nresearch has indicated that food insecurity is associated with poorer dietary choices among adults\n(Kendall et al., 1996). Additionally, it is believed to be possible that the food insecure may both fast\nand feast as a consequence of their economic circumstances which are not constant. McIntyre and\nGlanville et el (Mclntyre et al., 2003) suggest that children in households are protected from\nfluctuating intake and are given precedence in the family distribution hierarchy by their mothers.\nNeither the data from this study nor elsewhere confirm any relationship between household food\nsecurity status and BMI among children in developed countries.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe 8-index NZ Food Security Model has been demonstrated to be sufficient and appropriate\nto assess food security in the NZ population. Not only does the model provide a means of assessing the",
    "Page_107": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30 107\nprevalence of food security/insecurity at a household level, but it demonstrates that there is a clear\nrelationship between level of food insecurity and nutrient intake.\nThe major conclusion from the examination of the prevalence of household food security in\nNew Zealand is that only 72.8% of households in 1997 (some of which included children) and 50.5%\nof households with children in 2002 described themselves as food secure. Since the data described\nhere further illustrate that members of food insecure households, both adults and school children\nconsumed diets with poorer nutrient intakes and food insecure adults had less desirable body weight\nstatus, it is an inescapable conclusion that food insecurity matters. It impacts on nutritional health and\nwellbeing. The reasons why a significant proportion of NZ households do not have enough money\navailable to spend on the food they need, need to be explored. For some it will be that their income\nlevel or benefit is insufficient for their needs. For others there will be real reasons why the money\npotentially available for food is expended in other areas. To ignore the social and economic causes of\nfood insecurity is to reap poorer nutritional health.\nREFERENCES\nBond, T. G., & Fox, C. M. (2001).

RAVINDRAN\n Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University,\nPrivate Bag 11222, Palmerston North\nABSTRACT\nThis study was undertaken to determine the changes in apparent metabolisable energy (AME)\nand nutrient digestibility over the first two weeks of life in broiler chicks fed diets based on different\ncereals. Three experimental diets were formulated containing wheat, sorghum or maize as the cereal\nbase and fed for two weeks. On days 3, 5, 7, 9 and 14, total excreta collection was undertaken, feed\nintake measured, and AME calculated. The digestibility of starch, fat and protein was determined on\ndays 5, 7 and 14 using titanium oxide as an indigestible marker. Cereal effects on AME were\nsignificant on days 7 and 9 (P<0.05) with values for the wheat diet being lower than those for sorghum\nor maize diets. Age effects on AME were highly significant (P < 0.0oo1). The AME values were high\non day 3, declined on days 5 and 7 and then increasing at day 14. Cereal effect on nutrient digestibility\ndiet on day 7. Starch and fat digestibility showed highly significant age effects (P < 0.0001), with\ndigestibility decreasing from day 5 to day 7 and then increasing at day 14. In general, the present data\nare suggestive of digestive inefficiency during the first week of life in the newly hatched broiler chick.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe first week after hatch is the most critical period in the life of a broiler chicken. When the\nchick emerges from the egg, its digestive and immune systems are still immature and the bird is not\nwell prepared to face the environmental challenges confronting them. First, there is the transition from\nyolk to oral nutrition. Associated with this are the substantial physical and functional development of\nthe digestive tract and organs and the development of active immunity. The capacity to digest the feed\nand, absorb and transport nutrients appears to be limiting during the early life of broilers. To achieve\ntheir genetic potential, the neonate must quickly adapt to efficiently digesting and utilising nutrients\nfrom relatively complex exogenous dietary sources in which energy is supplied predominantly by\ncarbohydrates.\nWith the first 14 days post-hatch now representing 40% of the total life of the broiler chicken,\na better understanding of the development of digestive capacity of the newly hatched chick is of\nincreasing importance. Studies on the changes with age in the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) in\nthe young broiler chick are limited (Zelenka, 1968; Batal and Parsons, 2002). The present study was\nundertaken to determine the AME of diets based on wheat, sorghum and maize during the first two\nweeks post-hatch of broilers. The study also measured changes in the digestibility of starch, fat and\nprotein over the first 14 days of age to test the hypothesis that changes in AME with age are due to\nlimitations in the digestion capacity of specific nutrients.\nMATERIALSANDMETHODS\nThree dietary treatments based on wheat, sorghum and maize were used in the trial. The diets\nwere formulated to have similar levels of AME, amino acids and other major nutrients (Table 1). The\nwheat-based diet was supplemented with a commercial xylanase. Titanium oxide (BDH Laboratory\nSupplies, Poole, England) was added to all diets at 0.3% as an inert marker. The diets were formulated\nto meet or exceed the NRC (1994) requirements for all nutrients. All diets were steam pelleted at 70 °C.\nDay old male broilers were randomly assigned to six replicate groups for each dietary\ntreatment (8 chicks/ replicate). On days 3, 5, 7, 9 and 14, feed intake was measured and total excreta\ncollected over a 24-hour period. A sample of feed was taken daily and dry matter (DM) contents were",

AME values and starch, fat and protein digestibility were subjected to repeated measures analysis.\nTable 1.

AMERAH, V. RAVINDRAN, R.G.LENTLE and D.G.THOMAS\nInstitute of Food,Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University\nPalmerstonNorth\nABSTRACT\nThe objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of feeding whole-wheat through\nmixed feeding (MF) or free choice feeding (FCF) on the performance, digestive tract development and\ncarcass traits in broilers. Male broilers (n = 648), 7 days of age, were placed on floor pens on litter in\nground wheat (GW) and whole wheat (WW). The GW was fed in pelleted form, the whole wheat was\nfed either via MF (10 and 20% WW replacing GW during 7-21 and 22-35 days, respectively) or as\nFCF of WW and a protein concentrate. Each diet was fed ad libitum to six pens of 36 birds each.\nWhole-wheat inclusion, substituting up to 20% ground wheat, in a MF system, had no effects (P >\n0.05) on body weight, feed intake and feed efficiency. Free choice feeding resulted in the lowest (P <\n0.05) body weight and feed intake throughout the trial period, with no effect (P > 0.05) on feed\nefficiency compared to control diet. Whole-wheat feeding increased (P < 0.05) gizzard size, but this\nhad no positive effects on feed efficiency. Both WW feeding systems reduced (P < 0.05) carcass\nrecovery and abdominal fat. These findings suggest that whole wheat can substitute up to 20% of\nground wheat in a MF system, but FCF may not be appropriate to fast-growing modern broilers.\nINTRODUCTION\nFeeding whole grains has fascinated researchers for a long time. Lately, there has been a\nrenewed interest in the whole grain feeding, which is driven by the need to reduce feed costs while\nimproving animal welfare (Cumming, 1994; Covasa and Forbes, 1996). Considerable feed cost savings\ncan be achieved by combining the whole wheat with pellet-processed feed in the broiler diet (Ferket,\n2000). Feeding whole grain reduces feed cost due to reduced handling and processing. Thus, if the\nbirds fed whole wheat have performed at least as well as those fed complete diet, then the economics\nwill favour whole grain feeding (Forbes and Covasa, 1995).\nWhole grains can be offered to poultry via three different techniques (Rose, 1996), namely, (i)\n Free choice feeding (FCF), where the birds reared in a flock are offered whole grain and another feed\nin separate feeders ad libitum and they have the choice to select ingredients; (ii) Mix feeding (MF),\nwhere the whole grain is added substituting part of the ground grain in a complete diet usually pelleted\nor adding whole grain in addition to the complete balanced diet in the same feeder at the same time; or\n(i) Sequential feeding, where the whole grain is fed in sequence with other feed. The objectives of this\nstudy were to investigate the effects of feeding whole-wheat through MF or FCF on the performance,\ndigestive tract development and carcass traits in broilers.\nMATERIALS ANDMETHODS\nDay-old male broiler chicks were obtained from commercial hatchery and were reared on a\nS        r    n  \nbroiler starter crumbles and water ad libitum. The temperature maintained at 31 °C at the first week\nand then was gradually reduced to 22 °C at 24 days of age. The birds received constant fluorescent\nillumination throughout the experiment. At day 7 of age, chicks were assigned on the basis of body\nweight to the floor pens on litter in an environmentally controlled room. A summary of treatments is\nshown in Table 1.",

Whole wheat and the protein concentrate were offered in separate feeders\nTwo wheat-soy basal diets were formulated - one for the starter phase from day 7 to day 21\nand the other for the finisher phase from day 22 to day 35 (Table 2).

During 22-35 days, the weight gain and feed intake of\nbirds fed the whole-wheat diet was lower (P < 0.05) than those fed the ground wheat diet, but there\nwere no differences (P > 0.05) in feed/gain. Over the whole trial period (7-35 days), however, no\ndifferences were observed between the two treatments for any of the performance parameters.\nTable 3.

During week 1, the protein\nconcentrate was consumed more than the whole-wheat - 69% in the first week. For this reason, the\namount of protein concentrate offered was restricted during the subsequent weeks. Overall, the average\n           s   g \nbirds did not balance their energy consumption, resulting in the poor performance.\nOur observations suggest that choice feeding may not be successful in fast-growing modern\nbroilers. Factors that affect diet selection such as learning and previous experience, visual differences\nbetween the foods, texture and flavour of the food and palatability (Covasa and Forbes, 1996) may\nexplain the lower whole-wheat intake in the FCF when offered ad libitum with the protein concentrate.\nAnother possible reason is that the training of birds to consume whole-wheat commenced only on 7\ndays of age. Indeed, it has been reported by Covasa and Forbes (1996) that training should be given in\nthe first week. It has also been supported by observation of Hess (1964) that preferences for food by\nbirds are determined between 3 and 5 days of age. Forbes and Covasa (1995) also stated that “it is\nbeneficial to the birds to be trained and experience choice feeding in the first week of their life as it\nimproves their ability to select foods to meet nutrient requirements at later stages\".\n In the present study, whole-wheat feeding increased (P < 0.05) the relative gizzard weights\n(Table 4). Interestingly, the FCF birds had the heaviest (P < 0.05) gizzards. This is consistent with",
    "Page_123": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005,Vol. 30123\nprevious results (Wu and Ravindran, 2004). Health benefits of increasing gizzard weight include\nreduction in liter consumption, reduction in aggression, improvement in gut motility (Ferket, 2000),\nand improvement in digestibility of the nutrients such as starch by effective grinding in the gizzard. The\nincreased gizzard weight may also reduce the risk of coccidiosis (Cumming, 1992).\nTable 4.

No significant differences in\nbreast meat yield were observed between the ground wheat and whole-wheat diets, but the yields from\nbirds on FCF were significantly (P < 0.05) lower. Whole-wheat feeding significantly (P < 0.05)\nreduced relative abdominal fat weights compared to the ground wheat diet.\nIn conclusion, under the conditions of the current study, the performance of birds fed whole-\nwheat diets was similar to those fed the ground wheat diet. Gizzard weights were increased by whole-\nwheat feeding, but no advantage was noted in terms of feed efficiency. Free choice feeding of whole\nwheat and protein concentrate resulted in poor broiler performance. It is suggested that free choice\nfeeding may not be appropriate to fast-growing modern broilers. Since the published reports on the\neffects of whole-grain feeding on broiler performance are quite contradictory, further studies are\nwarranted to examine the causes for the variable responses.\nREFERENCES\nCovasa M & Forbes JM (1996) Effects of prior experience and training on diet selection of broiler\nchickens using wheat.

The results showed that the\nprotein contents of L. angustifolius were comparable to those of soybeans. Peas had intermediate\nprotein levels, while chickpeas had the lowest. Both lupin species had high fibre and non-starch\npolysaccharide contents that were more than double those found in other legumes. All legumes were\nfound to be deficient in methionine. The amino acid scores and the protein efficiency ratio data\nindicated that the protein quality of the legumes were in the following order: chickpeas > peas > lupins.\nMortality was not influenced by feeding of raw forms grain legumes, suggesting that the tested\ncultivars did not contain significant concentrations of any anti-nutritive factors. It is concluded that the\npoor protein quality of the tested legumes for poultry, compared to soybean meal, is related to the\ndeficiency of key limiting amino acids, rather than to the presence of anti-nutrients.\nINTRODUCTION\nMeat and bone meal is an important protein component in poultry diets in New Zealand, with\n go ssn  uo u  isn p  q s ooto xoe go uonsuoo pn u\nand bone meal, however, remains a possibility in the near future. The major protein source is imported\nsoybean meal (ca 78,00o tonnes per year), but there are concerns about increasing prices and the\ngenetically-modified soybeans. A locally grown protein source will give the poultry feed industry more\nstability and add flexibility in diet formulations. Of the various possibilities, grain legumes offer the\ngreatest potential. Usefulness of grain legumes has been extensively researched elsewhere and\nconsiderable information is available on their nutritive value. While such information could serve as a\nguide, it may be inadequate for accurate feed formulations under New Zealand conditions. Interactions\nof cultivars, soil, climate and agronomic factors could cause appreciable differences in nutrient profiles\nand digestibility between locally grown feedstuffs and those available elsewhere.\n The utilisation of grain legumes as sources of protein for poultry is limited due to the\nuncertainty about their nutritional quality. The variation reported in the quality of grain legumes is\nrelated, primarily, to variable amounts of anti-nutritional factors that depress bird performance. The\nanti-nutritional factors commonly found in grain legumes include protease inhibitors, lectins, tannins,\nin poor growth and feed efficiency in poultry; but each legume produces a different response. Most\ncurrent cultivars have been bred for low levels of these anti-nutritional factors and can be used in diets\nfor poultry and pigs without any need for processing. However, to the authors’ knowledge, no\npublished data is available on the nutritive value of grain legumes grown in New Zealand. Thus the\naim of the evaluation reported herein was to screen the grain legume cultivars grown in New Zealand\non the basis of nutrient concentrations and protein quality.\nMETHODOLOGY\nA total of 68 grain legume samples were evaluated from Year 1 harvest (2003/04). The\nsamples included lupins (both albus and angustifolius; two cultivars each; n = 17), chickpeas (four\ncultivars; n = 20), Peas (nine cultivars; n = 27) and soybeans (two cultivars; n = 4). The samples were\nscreened in three stages.",
    "Page_125": "Proceedings of the Nutrition Society of New Zealand, 2005, Vol. 30  125\nStage 1 - Proximate and fibre composition: All samples were analysed for dry matter, crude protein,\ncrude fat, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and ash.\nStage 2 - Mineral and amino acid concentrations: Samples were pooled within cultivars and\n analysed for minerals and amino acids.\nStage 3 - In vivo screening: In vivo tests (19 legume samples and a control soybean meal) were\ncarried out using broiler chickens in a 10-day feeding trial. Weight gain and feed intake were recorded,\nand the protein efficiency ratio (PER) was calculated. The effects of organ weights (heart, liver and\npancreas) were also recorded. The expected outcomes were to obtain preliminary data on the following:\n(i). the presence of anti-nutrients/ toxic factors in cultivars under test, (i). ranking of cultivars within a\n grain legume, and (i). grading of different legumes into high, medium or poor quality\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nProximate and fibre compositions\nOnly an overall summary of the data will be presented. The comparison of proximate and\nfibre compositions of the five legumes is shown in Table 2. There were marked differences between the\nlegumes in terms of protein, fat and fibre contents. Angustifolius lupins had protein contents that were\ncomparable to soybeans. Albus lupins had lower contents of protein and higher contents of fat than\nAngustifolius lupins. Both lupin species had high fibre contents (due largely to non-starch\npolysaccharides) that were more than double that found in other legumes. Peas had intermediate\nprotein levels (around 25 g/ 100 g), while chickpeas had the lowest. The fat contents were high in\nsoybeans, intermediate in lupins and chickpeas and very low in peas.\nAmino acid profiles\n A comparison of amino acid profile (% crude protein) of the five legumes and soybean meal is\nshown in Table 3. This Table enables the comparison of the ingredients on a protein basis and gives\nindication of deficiencies in the most limiting amino acids in poultry diets, namely lysine, methionine\nand threonine. It can be seen that the lysine concentrations in chickpea and pea proteins were\ncomparable to that in soy protein, but the lysine concentration in lupin protein was lower. Compared to\nsoybean meal, methionine concentrations in chickpeas were higher and those in peas and lupins were\nlower. Threonine concentrations in all five legumes were lower than that in soybean meal.\nTable 2.

Within each legume, some variation was seen in the protein quality (measured as weight gain and\nprotein efficiency ratio) of the different cultivars. In general, these variations were minor and it was \nconcluded that the cultivar effects on protein quality for broiler chickens are negligible.\n2. However, there were marked differences in the protein quality of different legumes. None of the\n ne  ia i n d m s e sd u d g  u i s  s\nobserved differences between legumes is due to deficiencies in the limiting amino acids (see Table 3)\n3. Raw soybeans supported the lowest weight gain and had the lowest PER. This is probably reflective \nof the anti-nutritive factors in raw soybeans. The birds fed diets containing raw soybeans had high\nmortality and high relative weights of pancreas, the latter suggesting the presence of protease\ninhibitors.\n4. Mortality was not increased by feeding of raw forms of chickpeas, peas or lupins, suggesting that\nthese do not have significant concentrations of any anti-nutritive factors. There were no effects on the\nrelative weights of any organs. The lack of effects on relative pancreatic weights of chicks fed diets \ncontaining raw legume meals indicate that the level of protease inhibitors in these legumes were low.",

The amino acid scores and the protein efficiency ratio data indicated that the protein quality of the\nlegumes were in the following order: soybean meal > chickpeas > peas > lupins > (raw) soybeans.\n6. These data suggest that the relatively poor protein quality of the legumes is due to deficiency of key\nlimiting amino acids, rather than to the presence of anti-nutrients.

Therefore, we have assessed the selenium status of 515 NE Thai children (259 males; 256\nfemales) aged 6.00 to 12.99 yr from 10 schools in Ubon Ratchthani province. Serum selenium\nconcentrations were analyzed by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (GFAAS)\nand dietary selenium intakes by Hydride Generation AAS from one-day duplicate diet composites,\ncollected from 79 (39 F; 40 M) randomly selected children. Inter-relationships between serum selenium\nand selenium intakes, as well as biochemical micronutrient indices (analyzed earlier) were also\nexamined. Mean serum selenium was 1.46 μmol/L; concentrations were independent of sex, but\nincreased significantly with age (p=0.03) among the females. This mean level was comparable to that\nof US children (1.48 μmol/L), but higher than that of New Zealand (NZ) (0.97 μmol/L) and United\nKingdom (O.87 μmol/L) children. None of the NE Thai children had serum selenium concentrations\nassociated with clinical selenium deficiency (i.e., < 0.1 μmol/L). Indeed for 61% (n=312), levels were\nindicative of maximal activity of plasma GSHPx and selenoprotein P, and for 38% (n=194) above\nthose suggested to protect against some cancers.

This can be partly attributed to an aging population and\naspects of our modern lifestyle. Although the disease is incurable, simple lifestyle changes well before\ndisease onset can bring about an appreciable reduction of risk. The purpose of this study was to\ninvestigate New Zealand women's knowledge of osteoporosis preventative behaviours and their health\nbeliefs about osteoporosis. It was hypothesised that both knowledge and health beliefs would change\nwith increasing age.\nWomen (n=622) between the ages of 20 and 49 years responded to an email invitation to\nbehaviours such as calcium intake and physical activity, and their health beliefs about osteoporosis.\nThe subject group was predominantly NZ European and well-educated.\nThere was a significant difference in the level of knowledge between the 3 different age groups (20-29,\n30-39, 40-49 yrs), but overall the score was low (M=16.4, SD=4) from a possible score of 24.\n However, there was no difference between age groups in perceived severity of the disease, or personal\nsusceptibility. The mean score in these sub-sets indicated a neutral attitude to personal susceptibility,\nand only slightly above neutral attitude to the severity of the disease.\n Health promotion theories suggest that a number of conditions, including awareness of\nsusceptibility and belief in the severity of the disease, must be met before people will change their\nbehaviour to reduce health risk. These findings indicate that although women become more\nknowledgeable about osteoporosis with age, their beliefs about personal susceptibility and severity of\nthe disease do not appear to increase.",

Probiotic bacteria, in turn, have been shown to affect both nutrient uptake and\nimmune function. The commercial prebiotic supplement CalfCareTM was assessed in neonatal calves\nfor direct effects on Lactobacillus and Bididobacterium species diversity, and for indirect effects on\nnutrient uptake and immune cell function.\nMilk-fed Holstein-Fresian bull calves were supplemented twice daily with the prebiotic from\nthe age of 6 days to 27 days. Faecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of the study.\nFaecal DNA was amplified by PCR using genus-specific primers and assessed for species diversity by\ndenaturing gradient gel elecrophoresis. Compared to unsupplemented calves, those receiving the\nprebiotic experienced fewer changes in Lactobacillus species over the 3 week period (P<0.05),\nsuggesting that the prebiotic stabilised colonisation. No Bifidobacteria were detected in any faecal\nsamples.\nCalf body weights were assessed every 2 - 3 days. Calves receiving the prebiotic weighed\nsignificantly more at the end of the study. Feed conversion efficiency was 57.2% in control calves\nversus 71.1% in prebiotic-supplemented calves (P<0.05).\n1 and 3, the proportion of lymphocytes cells amongst the peripheral blood leukocytes increased\nsignificantly in the prebiotic-supplemented, with a concurrent, significant decrease in the proportion of\nneutrophils. Changes in the leukocyte populations in control calves followed a similar trend but to a\nlesser, non-significant degree. Neutrophil phagocytosis of bacteria significantly increased in prebiotic-\nsupplemented calves but not control calves. There were no significant differences between the groups\nin incidence of rotavirus infection, scouring, or lymphocyte function. We hypothesise that the prebiotic\n CalfCareTM indirectly increased weight gain, feed conversion efficiency, and neutrophil function in\ncalves by enhancing the stability and long-term colonisation of important Lactobacillus species in the\ngut.",

ASHFIELD-WATT and E.A. STEWART\nInstitute of Food Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University.\nABSTRACT\n Introduction Fruits and vegetables have health promoting properties and are healthy\nalternatives to energy dense, nutrient poor snacks. However, fruit and vegetable intakes in many New\nZealand children are poor. This pilot study evaluated a free fruit to low decile primary schools\nintervention carried out in Auckland in 2004.\nSubjects and methods Ten pairs of South Auckland schools (matched for roll size and\ngeographic location) were selected from the 2003 Ministry of Education database. One school within\neach pair was randomly selected to receive free fruit for a school term (intervention group). The\ndietary intakes of all children were assessed using a diet recall method on three occasions: immediately\nprior to the fruit provision; at the end of the fruit period; and 6 weeks after cessation of fruit provision.\n Results Fruit intakes were similar in the control and intervention groups at baseline, with over\n40% not reporting any fruit intake. Immediately following the intervention, fruit consumption was\nsignificantly greater in the intervention group compared to controls (C=1.2 pieces/d; I=1.6 pieces/d,\n P<0.001) and the proportion of children not consuming fruit dropped to 22%. This increase in fruit\nconsumption was not sustained at six weeks after cessation of the free fruit delivery (C=1.2; I= 0.9\npieces/d).\nConclusions Provision of free fruit to low decile primary school children was an effective way\nof increasing their fruit intakes. However, these dietary patterns were not sustained once this short\nterm intervention ceased. There was some evidence of substitution of free fruit for fruit that would\n have otherwise been brought from home. Sustained fruit interventions would conceivably have long\nterm health benefits, but need to be supported by health promotion initiatives targeted at the whanau\nand community.",

This study examined preconception nutrition knowledge, and\n dietary and lifestyle habits in Auckland women of childbearing age.\nWomen aged 18-45 years (n=115) were recruited and data collected using a detailed\nquestionnaire, anthropometric measurements and a diet history to evaluate dietary intakes.\n18 women were attempting to conceive and 97 women indicated they were not currently planning\n pregnancy. The reproductive history of the women identified that 53 women had previously been\n pregnant but only 47% of these pregnancies had been planned.\nNearly all of the women (93.7%) had heard of folic acid and 65% were aware that folic acid\nwas required for pregnancy. Although 53.9% of the women knew that folic acid prevents birth defects,\nonly 31.3% of women had specific knowledge that folic acid use a month before conception can\nprevent neural tube defects. All of the women in the study who were currently planning a pregnancy\nhad heard of folic acid and 13 (72%) were taking a folic acid supplement (≥400ug).\n Although 80% of the women thought that dietary habits in the preconception period could\n affect pregnancy outcome few women thought preconception diet could influence risk of miscarriage,\npreterm delivery or maternal deficiencies. 83% of women used alcohol, 13.0% had a caffeine intake\n>300 mg/day, 8% smoked and 26.0% were overweight or obese.\nWomen recruited to the study demonstrated a lack of awareness of the importance of\npreconception nutrition and were not in an optimal physical state for pregnancy.

Many factors contribute to obesity in human adults such as\nnutrient intake and diet composition, activity and genetic background. Traditionally, knowledge about\ngenetic are investigated. A greater understanding can be obtained when all the available information\nand concepts are synthesised, transformed into mathematical algorithms, and integrated into a\n simulation model. In our simple model, the subjects are characterised by age, height and weight;\n nutrient intakes are defined as daily gross energy intake and the proportion of energy provided by the\nmacronutrients. The model then takes into account the digestibility of fat, protein (CP) and\ncarbohydrate (CH) and their respective energetic efficiencies to calculate the net energy intake. Energy\nand protein requirements as well as the energy cost for different physical activity level (PAL) are\ncalculated. The daily energy balance is then converted to body weight changes. Body weight changes\nwere first set to 0 in adjusting the activity level for a 24 year old male, 177cm tall, weighing 77.9kg and\neating 1.33MJ per day, (36% energy from fat, 14% from CP and 50% from CH) using data from the\nNZ National Nutrition Survey 1997. Model simulations conducted over a one-year period show that \nincreasing PAL by 5% results in a predicted 3.15kg weight loss. Manipulating the macronutrient ratio\nto meet the NZ dietary recommendations (30% energy from fat, 15% CP and 55% CH) generated a\nweight-loss of 0.270kg whereas simulating the Atkins diet (40% energy from fat and 40% from CP)\npredicted a 3.96kg reduction in weight over a year. Mathematical modelling can be used to predict the\neffect of dietary changes and can be useful in identifying the most appropriate dietary and activity\nrecommendations.",

While these are largely accepted to be the best methods currently\navailable, the search is on for more efficient and novel methods that reduce the effort required by study\npopulations as well as researchers. One such method involves the use of an electronic data collection\nA recent pilot study (SHOP) carried out by the Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of\nAuckland, tested the feasibility of a randomised trial design to measure the effectiveness of\ninterventions to promote the purchase of healthy foods from the supermarket. Data from this study was\nused to develop and test a database of nutrient composition data for top-selling supermarket foods.\nPrior to this project, there was no single complete nutrient database available in New Zealand\nfor researchers wishing to study the nutrient composition of brand-specific supermarket foods. Current\nnutrient databases include the New Zealand Food Composition Database (Food Files) and the\nManufactured Foods Database (MFD) both of which are incomplete for brand-specific supermarket\nfoods.\nOnly the top-selling supermarket food products in terms of sales volume were selected for\ninclusion in this database. Composition data for 7 key nutrients were obtained for each product. Firstly,\nproduct details were merged with the existing databases Food Files and MFD. Missing data was\nobtained by contacting manufacturers, searching brand websites, and visiting supermarkets to view\n product Nutrition Information Panels.\n A new database has been created that contains nutrient data for some top-selling supermarket\nfoods in New Zealand. As a worked example of one application, it has been used to evaluate the\nimpact of a pilot/feasibility study of supermarket interventions on the nutrient content of supermarket\npurchased foods.\nThe SHOP nutrient database has a number of potential applications for nutrition and public\nhealth research including evaluating the impact of interventions on the nutrient content of foods\npurchased from supermarkets and monitoring changes in the nutrient content of supermarket foods over\ntime.",

MORGAN3\nInstitute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health,Massey University,Palmerston North\n2PO Box 1020, Ruwi, Sultanate of Oman\n3School of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK\nABSTRACT\nNausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) is a common symptom of early pregnancy,\noccurring within 2-4 weeks of fertilisation and potentially representing a challenge to nutrient intake\n during a vulnerable period of fetal development. NVP is associated with favourable outcome of\npregnancy, including increased birthweight and gestational age. Mechanisms by which NVP positively\ninfluences pregnancy outcome might include increased nutrient intake to alleviate symptoms,\nimprovements in diet \"quality\" reduced energy expenditure and/or altered patterns of nutrient stores in\n response to changes in nutrient intakes.\n In an observational cohort study design, we recruited 52 women (with and without NVP) in\nGuildford, UK. Women kept a 7-day food diary and recorded symptoms and food cravings and\nEnergy and macronutrient intake fell with increased symptoms. Women reporting NVP had lower\nmean energy intakes, in early and late pregnancy and tended to have lower micronutrient intakes (not\nsignificant) than women without symptoms. Differences in energy intake were due to a significantly\nlower fat intake in women with NVP (P=0.032). Whilst all women studied increased their weight in\n pregnancy, women with NVP did not have significant increases in skinfold thickness during the final\ntrimester, possibly indicating differences in fat deposition.\nThese results suggest that NVP drives women to change their meal pattern and quality of their\ndiet, particularly intake of fat. Although the lower intake of fat is associated with symptoms of NVP\nand food aversion in early pregnancy, these women continue to consume a diet lower in fat throughout\npregnancy. This change in dietary quality may be associated with the favourable outcome of\npregnancy observed in women with NVP despite their lower nutrient intake. The new finding that body\nfat deposition in later pregnancy differs between women with or without NVP is intriguing and requires\nverification in future studies.",

However, low intakes of\ncalcium (595.7 mg/d) and high intakes of sodium (3748.8 mg/d) were identified.\nIntakes of these nutrients in this population were intermediate between native Koreans\nand native New Zealanders. Sodium intakes were higher than New Zealanders\nbecause of the maintenance of some traditional high sodium Korean foods in the diet\ne.g. kimchi. Intakes of calcium were lower than those of New Zealand women, but\nhigher than native Koreans because of a significantly greater intake of dairy products.\nSubjects had a lower prevalence of obesity, based on BMI, according to the New\n Zealand classification (2%) compared to the Korean one (24%) (P=0.005). However,\nalmost 50% subjects fell into the ^at risk’ classification for waist-to-hip ratio,\nsuggesting that subjects may have elevated upper body fat in relation to body size.\nThis study of Korean women identified areas of concern and indicated the\n need for further nutritional research into this population.

GIBSON\nChild Health Research Institute, North Adelaide,South Australia\nABSTRACT\n Iron deficiency is a relatively common problem in pregnancy in both developed and\n developing countries. In industrialised countries there is some debate about usefulness of routine iron\nsupplementation in pregnancy. The aim of the Adelaide Mothers’ and Babies Iron Trial was to\ninvestigate whether routine low dose iron supplementation in pregnancy has beneficial effects for the\nmother and child.\n Randomised controlled trial of a daily iron tablet (20mg) vs placebo from 20 weeks gestation\nuntil birth. Primary outcomes included maternal iron status at the end of the pregnancy and at 6\nmonths post partum, as well as childhood IQ at 4 years of age. Other outcomes included pregnancy\n outcome, maternal health and well-being and childhood behaviour at 4 years of age.\nResults: 431 women (215 in the control group and 216 in the iron group) were recruited from the\nWomen's and Children’s Hospital, Adelaide. The prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in the\niron group (3%) was lower than the control group (11%). By 6 months post-partum, the frequency of\nIDA did not differ between the two groups but women in the iron group had less iron deficiency\nindices of maternal mood and well-being. Similarly the mean IQ and mean behavioural scores of\nchildren born to mothers in the iron and control groups did not differ. However, the percentage of\nchildren with abnormal total behavioural scores was higher in the iron group compared with the control\ngroup.\n Conclusions: In our well nourished sample, there were no long term benefits of routine iron\nbehaviour requires substantiation.",

However, Hanna et al (2004) identified\naddition, Vitamin C has also been shown to degrade during storage (Buss et al 2001). These findings\nmay be significant for infants due to their immature antioxidant defence system and the fact that they\nrely on breast milk as their sole source of antioxidants against oxidative stress in early life.\n Samples of expressed breast milk are currently being collected from 10 healthy mothers.\nSamples will be analysed for total antioxidant status, Vitamin C, and lipid hydroperoxide at baseline\nand during storage conditions according to current New Zealand guidelines for storage of expressed\nbreast milk (MOH, 2000).\nTotal antioxidant status will be determined using a Randox assay kit, which has been modified\nfor use on a plate reader; Vitamin C will be measured by a fluorescent assay; lipid hydroperoxide will\nbe measured by a ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange assay.\nThe results will identify whether total antioxidant status or individual antioxidants of breast\n milk are affected by storage at room temperature, or during refrigeration and freezing.\nThis study will provide preliminary evidence of storage effects on antioxidants in breast milk.\nFurther research may be needed to modify current New Zealand guidelines for storage of expressed\nREFERENCES\nBuss, IH., McGill, F., Darlow, BA. & Winterbourn, CC.

The\nAguaruna Indigenous People live along the Rio Cenepa in the remote Peruvian Amazon and consume a\n cassava based diet, complemented by shift agriculture, fishing, hunting and gathering. Here we\nanalyze the nutritional importance of the Aguaruna traditional food system (TFS). Using \nanthropometric measurements including, we established the nutritional status of women and young\nseparation. A traditional food diversity score was calculated for each individual. Subsequently, we\nanalyzed the relative nutrient contributions of local foods. A market survey compared the nutrient\nvalue per price of seasonal local foods with imported products. Anthropometry indicated a healthy\npopulation, although Aguaruna had short stature. Group dietary data showed adequate intakes of\n energy, protein, fat, iron, zinc, vitamin C and vitamin A. The Aguaruna traditional food system has\nmany unique nutrient dense foods which are easy to obtain, including aguaje (Mauritian palm fruit),\nsuri (a type of larva) and wild meats such as armadillo and paca. Higher traditional food diversity was\nassociated with greater nutrient, vitamin and mineral intakes (Spearman's rho = 0.29 to 0.60).\nAguaruna purchased <1% of their diet and preferred local foods, which offered better nutrient value per\nunitprice.\n In this remote setting, traditional subsistence lifestyle can provide an adequate diet and\nsupport good health. The study found that overall women and children had adequate diets. Greater \ntraditional food diversity resulted in improved nutrient intakes. The Aguaruna study shows that\ntraditional food systems deserve promotion and protection.",

THOMSON\nFood Safety Group, ESR, POBox 29181, Christchurch Science Centre, New Zealand\nABSTRACT\nMankind's technological  progress  over  past decades has  generally  seen  significant\nimprovement in both the quantity and quality of our food supply. However, there has also been concern\nabout the potential impact on public health of both inadequate and excessive levels of nutrients in our\ndiet.\n The 2003/04 New Zealand Total Diet Survey (NZTDS) was undertaken for the New Zealand\nFood Safety Authority by ESR. A key focus inter alia was to estimate selected nutrient element intakes\nfrom foods consumed by New Zealanders. The 2003/04 NZTDS involved sampling of 121 different\nfoods, and purchase of a total of approximately 4400 samples from July 2003 to June 2004. Foods were\nprepared ‘table ready' prior to analyses, to best reflect actual dietary intakes.\nFortnightly simulated diets for eight age-sex groups within the NZ population were developed from\n1997 National Nutrition Survey and 2002 Children Nutrition Survey data. The 2003/04 NZTDS\nconfirmed that mean daily intakes of iodine in NZ have continued their steady decline of the past 20\nyears. Mean iodine intakes based on the simulated diets were only 40-57% of RDI for the eight NZ\n population groups. Dairy, other animal products and infant weaning fods were the main dietary\nsources. The iodine content of most foods was less than 0.05 mg/kg. Nonetheless, the NZTDS\nidentified one brand of soy milk with 9.14 mg/kg iodine.\nEven with recently fortified grain products, 25+ year females have a mean iron intake of only\ns p   oo on o>  n os eo s   go %i\n intakes exceeded the upper intake limits for 7 of the 8 age-sex groups.",
