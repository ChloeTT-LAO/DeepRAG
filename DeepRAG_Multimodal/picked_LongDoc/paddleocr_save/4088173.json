It also gave us an opportunity to\ninteract amongst ourselves at a personal level, during and post sessions and this further helped understand differing ex-\nperiences and perspectives of the members. Also, the Jury was well represented by people from varying backgrounds,\nthus giving immense strength and vibrancy to the entire process.

Then we were back to showcasing our shortlisted\nnominations to the rest of the jury. The way it works is that each group shortlists nominations which is then discussed\nseemed to have some category winners picked!Actually, every nomination was considered as ifit was a potential Nobel\nPrize winner.\nThe next morning we all came charged up with zeal and excitement. Some of the nominations were very interesting and\nit was really amazing to learn about the work that these people are doing.
