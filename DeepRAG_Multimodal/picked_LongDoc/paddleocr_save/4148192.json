I had just gained 3000\nfeet of altitude in a thermal and had only drifted 5 miles\nfrom my airfield.  I slowly turned the glider back toward\nthe airfield and set up a constant airspeed glide to get the\nmagic maximum lift to drag ratio. A casual glance below\nalarmed me, however. I had no groundspeed; the wind was\nkeeping me over the same spot of ground!  I now knew that I\nmust fly faster than the maximum lift to drag airspeed, but\nhow much faster?  Too fast and I woula lose all my altitude,\ntoo slow and the wind would keep me from making sufficient\ngroundspeed.  I next thought about using ground effect to\nsqueeze out the last few thousand feet to the airport.  The\nwinds would be less at low altitude and my induced drag\nwould be reduced, allowing me to \"float\" farther. I delayed\nthe ground effect decision until the last minute.\nThis decision confronts glider pilots around the world\nevery day. Some experienced glider pilots adamantly claim\nthat ground effect can greatly extend gliae range. and they\nclaim to have floated several thousand feet in ground\neffect.  Indeed, ground effect theory predicts a large\nreduction in induced drag, and one should be able to glide\nfarther with this reduced drag. This thesis investigates\nthe possibility of extending glide range using ground\neffect, and it also gives the only glider flight test\nii",

Introduction\nBackground\nThe aerodynamic effect of flying close to the ground\nhas been analyzed and. to a small degree, tested in wind\ntunnels and flight since the 1920s. Yet according to\nofficials of the Soaring Society of America, the results of\nthis analysis and testing has never been applied to gliders.\nGround effect causes reductions in aircraft drag and wind\nvelocity. both of which could significantly increase a\nglider's maximum range. This research was conducted to\nevaluate previous predictions of ground effect and to\ndetermine the optimum flight profile to achieve maximum\nrange in a glider considering ground effect.\nDr. Sighard Hoerner in his book Fluid-Dynamic Lift (Ref\n6) incorporated the majority of all previous ground effect\nanalyses and testing. His theoretical predictions of ground\neffect showed that the aircraft drag due to lift (induced\ndrag) decreases exponentially as altitude above ground level\n(AGL) decreases. Also, since ground effect reduces only the\naircraft's induced drag. the drag reduction is greatest at\nlow airspeeds where the induced drag is greatest. Thus,\nground effect is most significant when an aircraft is low to\n1",

Under no wind conditions, the\nairspeed giving a maximum lift to drag ratio is flown.\nMaximizing the lift to drag ratio results in maximizing the\nground distance covered to altitude lost ratio in calm air.\nWhen headwinds or tailwinds are present, a different\nairspeed giving the maximum ground distance covered to\naltitude lost ratio is flown. These airspeeds do indeed\ngive the maximum range outside of ground effect, but under\nsome conditions a longer range results from terminating the\nconstant airspeea glide early. diving more steeply to gain\nairspeed, and leveling out very low above the ground.\nDetermining when and how to transition from the constant\nairspeed glide to level flight in ground effect constitutes\nthe problem of determining the optimum flight profile for\nmaximum range. A flight profile which extends a glider's\nmaximum range over that achievable with a constant airspeed\nglide could save the gliders and lives of many glider pilots\nwho find themselves short of an intended landing field at\nlow altitude.\nObjectives\n1.

Drag is normally expressed in\ncoefficient form, with the amount of drag being divided by\nthe dynamic pressure and by the wing planform area.  Drag\n. can be divided into 4 categories: parasite, induced, wave,\nand miscellaneous drag (10:4.30).

Skin\nfriction drag affects every surface of the aircraft and\nvaries with the Reynolds number of the airflow and with the\nroughness of the surface. Pressure drag is due to the\nairflow pressure difference between the forward and aft\naircraft surfaces. Pressure drag is primarily caused by\nairflow separation. Interference drag is caused by the\ninteraction of airflow around nearby external surfaces\n(10:4.1-4.14, 4.24-4.25).\n9",

Cooling drag is drag\ndue to energy lost in forcing air through cooling systems.\nCooling drag is negligible since the glider cockpit cooling\nvents were ciosed on all data runs.\nThe third form of miscellaneous drag is trim drag.\nwhich is the drag created by both the downforce on the\nhorizontal tail and the additional wing lift required to\novercome this downforce. This drag may be significant, and\nas shown in the drag\ncharacteristics estimation section.

The small control inputs made during\nthe flight tests aiso caused acaitional drag due to the\naerodynamic energy required to dampen the resulting small\noscillations of the glider, but this drag was again small\ndue to the gentleness of manuevering.\n11",

Conclusions and Recommendations\nConclusions\nThis research has met its 2 main goals of evaluating\nground effect theory and developing the optimum flight\nprofiles for maximum gliding range. All 8 specific\nobjectives listed in Chapter I were also accomplished.\nAlthough this research has shown that ground effect is not\npractical 'or safe to use in extending glide range, the\nproject did provide useful insight and valuable flight test\ndata on ground effect.\nA glider simulation was developed and revised which\naccurately predicted glider range performance. The 3 degree\nof freedom simulation had a visual display capability and\ncould simulate flight in wind or windless conditions.  The\nsimulation was limited to gentle manuevers, but these\nmanuevers were adequate to evaluate the ground effect\nprofiles due to the safety constraints on the manuevers.\nThe simulation matched Grob flight test results within 400\nfeet for 18 of 19 flight profiles flown and was the basis\nfor the optimizations used to determine the optimum flight\nprofile for maximum glide range.\nThe airspeed instrument errors and the drag polar of\nthe Grob G-lo3 were determined out of ground effect to allow\naccurate flight testing and simulation of the Grob. The\nairspeed instrument errors were determined through ground\n103",

These instrument errors were verified in\ngro-.id effect using radar gun velocity data and allowed the\ntests. The Grob drag polar was estimated using aircraft\ndesign methods and then measured using timed constant\nairspeed descents out of ground effect.  The design methods\ngave parasite drag coefficients within 19 percent of the\nflight test data, but the induced drag factors were up to 43\npercent more than the flight test data.  The induced drag\nfactor discrepancy shows a breakdown in the low aspect ratio\ndesign methods when used on high aspect ratio gliders. The\nflight test drag parameters were used in the simulation and\nallowed the evaluation of how the Grob drag polar changed in\nground effect flight tests.\nThe amount of drag reduction in ground effect was\nflight test determined at 8 altitudes ranging from 1o0 to 4\nfeet AGL. Radar position and velocity data were taken at 1\nsecond intervals on 47 level decelerations flown in the\nGrob. The steepest gradient and Gauss-Newton optimization\nalgorithms were used with the glider simulation to determine\nthe drag reduction due to ground effect inherent in these\ndata. The results of these tests showed that the lifting\nline derived predictions of induced drag reduction due to\nground effect matched flight test results down to 1o feet\nAGL but were up to l6 percent too optimistic below 1o feet.\n104",

In any case, glider performance at\ntheory would predict. A revised prediction of ground effect\napplicable to glider performance was developed and is shown\nin Figure 5.3.\nFlight test profiles were developed and flown in the\nGrob to test glide range with and without ground effect.\nRadar data were taken on 19 profiles flown in the Grob to\nevaluate the glide range of variations of pushover altitudes\nand dive angles.  These profiles showed that the lowest\npushover altitudes and the steepest dive angles safely\npossible gave the best glide range in ground effect. A\nrange gain of 1i79 feet was demonstrated over the standard\nnon-ground effect profile that glider pilots currently fly,\nbut this range gain was mostly due to the fact that the\nstandard profile was flown about 5 knots slower than the\nbest penetration speed.\nRadar data were taken on 7 flight profiles flown in the\nBlanik to determine if the simulation and ground effect\npredictions of the Grob could be applied to production\ngliders. The Blanik was tested with flaps retracted and\nextended to give 2 very different glider configurations and\nin effect test 2 different gliders.

    "Page_132": "Continuation of Block l9:\nabove 2o percent wingspan but were up to l6 percent too optimistic at\nlow altitudes. A revised prediction of ground effect induced drag\nreduction was developed based on the flight test data, and this revised\nprediction was used along with a turbulent boundary layer wind model in\ntwo optimization algorithms to develop the optimum flight profiles for\nmaximum range gliding flight. Although flight tests of these profiles\nin near perfect test conditions showed that glide range gains of up to\n1179 feet were possible over penetration airspeed glides, these profiles\ninvolve dangerous low altitude manuevers and are not predicted to give\nsignificant range gains over penetration airspeed glides in winds up to\n500 knots. Therefore, the results of this research are a revised\nprediction of ground effect at low altitude and the confirmation that\npenetration airspeed glides provide maximum glide range under normal\ncircumstances."
