Tablets have the advantage in such a situation because\nthey dissolve slowly and continue to release hypochlorite as water is pumped from the\nexcavation.\nSwabbing With  Hypochlorite Solution -  The  interior of all pipe and fittings\nFlushing  -  Thorough flushing is  the most practical means  of removing\npermit, flushing toward the work location from both directions is recommended.\nFlushing shall be started as soon as the repairs are completed and shall be continued\nuntil discolored water is eliminated.\nSlug Chlorination - When practical, in addition to the procedures above, the\nsection of main in which the break or connection is located shall be isolated, all service\nthat the dose may be increased to as much as 3o0 mg/L and the contact time reduced\nto as little as 15 min. After chlorination, flushing shall be resumed and continued until\ndiscolored water is eliminated, and the water is free of noticeable chlorine odor.\n-139-",
    "Page_83": "Sampling - Bacteriological samples shall be taken after repairs are completed to\nprovide a record for determining the procedure's effectiveness. If the direction of flow is\nunknown, then samples shall be taken on each side of the main break. If positive\nbacteriological samples are recorded, then the situation shall be evaluated by the\nDirector who can determine corrective action, and daily sampling shall be continued\nO:ICITY\\GB\\STANDARDS\\Rev_2006\\Doc\\2006Standards.doc\n-140-"
