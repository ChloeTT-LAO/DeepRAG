I am pleased to appear before the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and\nPensions today as it considers a topic of great importance, “Enhancing Retirement Security: Examining\nProposals to Simplify and Modernize Retirement Plan Administration.\" I will focus, in particular, on\nproposals that would facilitate the use of so-called “open MEPs\"” and enhance the effectiveness of\ncetirement plan communications by expanding the use of electronic delivery. Chairman Walberg and\nRanking Member Sablan, thank you for this opportunity to share our views and for the attention that\nyou and your colleagues are paying to issues so critical to American retirement savers.\n Thanks in no small part to Congress's efforts to promote retirement savings, Americans\ncurrently have $28.2 trillion earmarked for retirement, with more than half of that amount in defined\ncontribution (DC) plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs).? About half of DC plan and IRA\nassets are invested in mutual funds, which makes the mutual fund industry especially attuned to the\n needs of retirement savers.\nUnder the framework of a voluntary system, Congress has made available the tax structure and\nmarketplace has provided innovative products and services at increasingly lower costs.3\nWe commend this Subcommitte for considering proposals intended to enhance the successful\nDC plan system. ICI agrees that, even with the many successes of the US retirement system, we should\nalways be open to considering ways in which that system can be strengthened further to help even more\nAmericans achieve a secure retirement. For its part, the Institute has been vocal in its support for\n policies that would improve access to retirement savings opportunities and make retirement plans more\nefficient and effective —including permitting “open\" multiple employer plans (MEPs) and greater use\nof electronic delivery. Reforms like these will build upon the strengths of the current system and\n1 The Investment Company Institute (ICI) is the leading association representing regulated funds globally, including mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts (UITs) in the United States, and similar\nfunds offered to investors in jurisdictions worldwide.

In this respect\nconsideration of proposals aimed at strengthening the US retirement system are best guided by a clear\nunderstanding of Americans retirement prospects and the role that the current system plays in helping\nAmerican workers reach their retirement goals.\nSecond, my testimony will describe targeted reforms at the national level that would help bring\nmore employers into the system and generate better outcomes for retirement savers—importantly\nwithout detracting from the system's effective features. I will focus my testimony on two critical reform\nmeasures under this Subcommittee's consideration: One proposal, set forth in H.R. 854, the\nRetirement Security for American Workers Act, introduced by Reps. Vern Buchanan (R-FL), Richard\nNeal (D-MA), James Renacci (R-OH) and Ron Kind (D-WI), would allow employers to participate in\na single, multiple-employer plan (often referred to as a “MEP\") under the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974 (ERISA)—-regardless of the employer's industry and any other preexisting\nrelationship with other participating employers or the plan sponsor.

Contrary to this conventional wisdom, private-sector pension income has become\nmore, not less, prevalent and substantial over time. Since the enactment of ERISA, increasing numbers\nfrom these plans.\n· While there is opportunity for improvement, the retirement system is working for\nmillions of American workers. A wide range of work by government, academic, and industry\nresearchers who have carefully examined Americans saving and spending patterns, before and\nafter retirement, shows that the American system for retirement saving is working for the\nmajority of American workers and has grown stronger in recent decades. Assets specifically\nearmarked for retirement have increased significantly over time. Adjusted for inflation and\n4",

In retirement, different households will depend on each of these\ncomponents in differing degrees, subject to overall saving levels, work history, and other factors.\nFor most households, however, employer-sponsored retirement plans are crucial: about eight in\nten near-retiree households have retirement assets (DC plans or IRAs), DB benefits, or both.5\nAnd, recent joint research by ICI and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) economists, in addition\nto research by Census Bureau economists,7 confirm that income from these plans is widespread\namong retirees. The joint ICI and IRS research shows that most individuals in the study were\nable to maintain spendable income after claiming Social Security, and lower-income individuals\ntypically had higher replacement rates.8 The median worker in the study replaced 103 percent\nof spendable income after claiming Social Security and the median worker in the lowest quintile\nof income replaced 123 percent. Thanks to this multi-faceted system, successive generations of\nAmerican retirees have been better off than previous generations.?\nThe significance of Social Security must be considered in any assessment of the US\nretirement system. Social Security provides the foundation of retirement security for almost all\nAmerican workers and it replaces significant portions of income for lower-income retirees. In\nthis respect, Social Security replaces 83 percent of average inflation-indexed annual earnings for\nworkers in the lowest lifetime household earnings quintile; 54 percent for workers in the\nmiddle quintile; and 33 percent for workers in the highest quintile.10 Yet the Social Security\n4 See Figure 4, p. 11 (updated to year-end 2017), in Brady, Burham, and Holden, The Success ofthe US Retirement System,\nInvestment Company Institute (December 2012), available at www.ici.org/pdf/ppr_ 12_success_retirement.pdf.\n5 See Figure 8.4, p. 167, in Investment Company Institute, 2018 Investment Company Fact Book (2018); available at\nwww.ici.org/pdf/2018_factbook.pdf.

The fact\nis that the majority of workers needing and demanding access to pensions as part of their\ncompensation participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan.13 Efforts to expand\ncoverage will be more successful if policymakers better understand the reasons underlying why\nspecific populations are not participating in retirement savings vehicles. In this regard, research\nsuggests that small employers may be less likely than large employers to sponsor plans because a\nsmall employer is more likely to have lower-income, younger employees who are lesslikely to be\nfocused on saving for retirement.14\nThe voluntary employer-provided retirement system is characterized by flexibility,\ncompetition, and innovation. A strength of the voluntary employer-sponsored retirement\nsystem is the flexibility built into its design. Combined with competition—-among employers to\nfull benefit retirement age), replacement rates would increase to 96 percent for workers in the lowest quintile of lifetime\nhousehold earnings; 62 percent for workers in the middle quintile; and 39 percent for workers in the highest quintile.\n1 For projections related to these programs, see TheBoard ofTrustes,Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and\nSurvivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds (July 2017), Washington, DC: US Government Printing\nOffice, available at www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2017/tr2017.pdf; The Boards of Trustees, Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal\nSupplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, 2017 Annual Report ofthe Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital\nand Medicaid Services, available at www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-\nReports/ReportsTrustFunds/Downloads/TR2017.pdf; Congressional Budget Office, The 2017 Long-Term Budget Outlook\n(March 2017), available at www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/52480-ltbo.pdf; and Social\nSecurity Administration, “Detailed Reports on the Financial Outlook for Social Security's Old-Age, Survivors, and\nDisability Insurance (OASD1) Trust Funds\" (2017), available at www.ssa.gov/OACT/tr/index.html.\n12 Regardless of the form they take, changes to Social Security will likely increase the importance of employer-sponsored\nretirement plans and IRAs to provide for retirement adequacy. If Social Security benefits are cut, future retirees will need to\naccumulate more retirement resources. If taxes are raised on workers, net earnings willfll but the amount of earnings that\nwould need to be set aside to supplement Social Security benefits in retirement would remain largely unchanged. To the\nextent that either the benefit cuts or tax increases are structured to exempt workers with low lifetime earnings, it would place\nan even heavier burden on those already most dependent on employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs. For a\ndiscussion of how different methods of cutting Social Security benefits would impact workers with different levels of\nlifetime income, see Brady, “Measuring Retirement Resource Adequacy,” Journal of Pension Economics and Finance 9, no. 2\n(April 2010): pp. 235-262.\n ) A ou  ada as e ae s a u sire o, ssa pe ag o ei\navailable at www.ici.org/pdf/per24-01.pdf.\n14 See Brady and Bogdan, “Who Gets Retirement Plans and Why, 2013,\" ICI Research Perspective 20, no. 6 (October 2014);\n available at www.ici.org/pdf/per20-06.pdf.\n6",

The Institute supports the open MEP concept, especially for\nemployers with fewer than 100 employees—-the employer segment most in need of solutions to\nencourage retirement plan sponsorship.18\nSmall businesses often face particular challenges in establishing and maintaining retirement\nplans. Studies have found that concern about administrative costs and burdens are a significant reason\nthat more small businesses do not offer retirement plans. Small employers maintaining their own plan\nare required to prepare their own plan documents, summary plan descriptions and other participant\ndisclosures, file individual Form 5500s, obtain a separate financial audit, and establish a single trust.\nBecause of the fixed administrative costs of sponsoring a plan, small plans may not qualify for lower cost\ninvestment options or lower recordkeeping fees. In addition to administrative and compliance burdens,\nsmaller employers may be challenged by the fiduciary responsibility and liability of selecting and\nmonitoring service providers and plan investment options.\n1. Existing rules prevent effective use of MEPs\nCurrent legal impediments preclude small employers from banding together to participate in a\nsingle retirement plan maintained by a single service provider, and thus prevent small employers from\n gaining the same efficiencies that larger employers enjoy.

    "Page_10": "Department of Labor (DOL) guidance essentially has foreclosed the operation of retirement\nplans covering groups of unrelated employers under ERISA.19 This guidance generally provides that for\na single ERISA plan to exist, the employers that participate in the plan must be tied together by a\ncommon economic interest or organizational relationship unrelated to the provision of benefits. To the\nextent there is no such relationship, each participating employer is treated as establishing and\nmaintaining a separate employee benefit plan for its own employees.\nIn addition, employers are discouraged from joining a multiple employer plan by the Internal\nRevenue Code (\"Code\"), which provides that violations of tax-qualification requirements by one\nparticipating employer could disqualify the entire plan.2° Under the so-called “one bad apple\" rule, a\nviolation of the Code's tax-qualification requirements by one participating employer in a multiple\nemployer plan could result in disqualification of the entire plan for all participating employers. For\nexample, if one participating employer in a multiple employer plan fails to satisfy the top-heavy rules,\nthen the multiple employer plan may be disqualified for all of the employers in the plan.\n 2. H.R. 854 would eliminate many of these barriers and encourage employers to join\nMEPs\n H.R. 854 would allow otherwise unrelated employers to band together and participate in open\nMEP arrangements (referred to in the bill as “pooled employer plans\"). The billalso includes important\nsafeguards for open MEP arrangements to ensure the legitimacy of the sponsoring entity and adherence\nto ERISA fiduciary standards. Key legal protections for plan participants would be as follows:\n· Employers would transfer fiduciary responsibility for selecting and monitoring plan investment\noptions to the pooled plan provider, who would be the “named fiduciary.\"\nthe selection and monitoring of the pooled plan provider “named fiduciary.\" Importantly, as\nnoted above, participating employers would be relieved of the liability for selecting and\nanother fiduciary by the pooled plan provider) —an important incentive to join a pooled\nemployer plan and offer a retirement plan to employees.\nthe plan.

Most of the guidance addresses associations, but some addresses other types of\norganizations (e.g., financial institutions, franchises, employee leasing and professional service organizations).\n20 In contrast to DOL guidance requiring a common interest or relationship between the participating employers, Code\nsection 413(e) provides special tax-qualification rules that accommodate plans sponsored by two or more employers that are\nnot in the same controlled group or otherwise related. Under these rules, employers participating in the multiple employer\nplan are treated as one employer for certain purposes (e.g., minimum participation testing; vesting) and as separate\nemployers for certain other purposes (e.g, nondiscrimination and minimum coverage testing; deduction rules).",

This requirement would not prohibit an\ninvestment fund from imposing fees or charges normally assessed to any shareholder or investor\n in the normal course of business, such as redemption fees.\n The bill also would eliminate the “one bad apple” rule under the tax Code referenced above,\nallowing plans with pooled plan providers (or MEPs with employers sharing a common interest) to\ncontinue to be treated as satisfying the tax qualification requirements despite the violation of those\nrequirements with respect to one or more participating employers. In the case of a violation of the tax\nqualification requirements by a participating employer, the bill would allow the plan to spin off the\nportion of the plan's assets attributable to that participating employer, into a separate plan maintained\nby that employer. This removes another unnecessary legal impediment to greater use of MEP\narrangements.\nAllowing small employers to participate in a single, multiple-employer ERISA plan—-regardless\nof the employer's industry or any other preexisting relationship with other participating employers or\nthe plan sponsor--will reduce administrative and compliance costs and burdens, and ultimately\nimprove the availability of retirement plans to employees of small employers. In addition, by providing a\nlevel of liability relief for investment options offered under the plan, small employers would be\nencouraged to participate in a MEP, while at the same time ensuring that plan participants are\nprotected by ERISA.\nB. The Time Has Come to Modernize and Make Consistent Rules for Electronic Delivery of\nPlan Information to Participants and Beneficiaries\n1.

The click-through/hyperlink nature of the internet allows\nparticipants to see exactly the level of information that is right for them.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) enhancements to mutual fund prospectus\nrequirements is instructive here.

Additional Changes Will Foster Innovation and Growth in the Voluntary Employer\nSponsored Retirement Plan System\n Even with its many current strengths, the US retirement system can be strengthened further to\n help even more Americans achieve a secure retirement. Attached to this statement is a document\ntitled “Retirement Plan Modernization Proposals,” describing policies supported by the Institute that\nwould improve access to retirement savings opportunities and make retirement plans more efficient\nand effective. These reforms would build upon the current system by expanding coverage,\nparticipation, and savings rates in DC plans and IRAs; improving the delivery and quality of\ninformation and education to plan participants and plan sponsors; enhancing flexibility in\ndetermining how and when to tap retirement savings; and eliminating unnecessary burdens in plan\nadministration so that plans can function more effectively.\n In addition to expanding the use of MEPs and electronic delivery of plan information as\ndiscussed above, these proposed reforms include:\nNew SIMPLE Plan. As noted earlier, small businesses often face particular challenges in\nestablishing and maintaining retirement plans. While the SIMPLE IRA and other existing plan\noptions offer a relatively simple solution to plan sponsorship, none of the existing plan options work\nwell for workplaces where the majority of workers are focused on saving for goals other than\nretirement—such as education, a home, or an emergency fund. Many small employers want to offer\nemployees the option to contribute to a 401(k) or similar plan, but cannot meet the non-\ndiscrimination tests and do not have the capacity to make the required employer contributions\nassociated with the safe harbor 401(k) plan or a SIMPLE plan. For employers whose workforces place\nless value on compensation paid as retirement benefits as opposed to take-home wages, the required\nemployer contributions discourage the adoption of SIMPLE plans. Creating a new type of SIMPLE\nplan for small employers would encourage greater plan creation and coverage in smaller workplaces.\nThe new plan would be modeled on existing SIMPLE plans, but would not require employer\ncontributions. It would have contribution limits above traditional and Roth IRA limits, but below\nexisting SIMPLE plan limits.26 Such a plan would accommodate any employee who wants to save for\nretirement, while preserving the incentives for the employer to step up to a SIMPLE IRA or 401(k)\nplan.\nEnhance Automatic Enrollment Safe Harbors. Studies show that automatic enrollment has 3\nnotable impact on the participation rates of lower-income and younger workers because these groups\n26 We not that aconcetuall similar provision, rferred toasthestarek plan,haben proposedbythen Ranking\n15",
    "Page_17": "are typically less likely to participate in a DC plan where affirmative elections are required.27\nEmployers should be encouraged to use automatic enrollment if appropriate for their employee base.\nEmployers may want to enroll their workers at higher levels of savings and escalate the savings more\nsubstantially than is perceived appropriate under current law. For plan sponsors that rely on the\nnondiscrimination testing safe harbor established under the Pension Protection Act of 2006—-known\nas the qualified automatic contribution arrangement or “QACA\"—the 10 percent ceiling is a barrier\nto escalating automatic contributions to levels that in some cases may be more appropriate for\noften perceive the rule's 10 percent limit as a ceiling outside the safe harbor.) Accordingly, there is\nbroad agreement across the retirement plan community for removing the 10-percent cap on automatic\n escalation deferral rates for plan participants.\nIn addition, while the QACA safe harbor has been applauded for encouraging the use of\nautomatic enrollment, many plan sponsors believe that the safe harbor default contribution levels are\ntoo low and that higher contribution levels are necessary to ensure a secure retirement for plan\nparticipants. Creating a new automatic enrollment safe harbor would give employers another option\nalongside the QACA safe harbor, with higher minimum default contribution rates and a “stretched'\nH ed jo susd oi asea e nq on suedied sn on n uonq u\ntax credit might also be included to encourage small employers to adopt the new automatic\nenrollment safe harbor.

ICI believes that these changes\nwould give employers more flexibility to design their plans to meet the needs of their particular\n Index IRA Catch-up Contributions. Another modest change to improve savings rates\ndescribed in our proposals would be to index IRA catch-up contribution limits for inflation. Since\ntheir creation in 1974, IRAs have played a vital role in building retirement security for workers\nwithout access to a retirement plan at work, for small business owners, and for non-working spouses.\nLike contribution limits for workplace plans, the general contribution limit for IRAs is indexed so\nthat its value is not eroded over time. The catch-up contribution limit for 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b)\nplans also are all inflation indexed, but the catch-up contribution limit for IRAs— which was last\nadjusted to $1,000 per year in 2006—is not. We believe the catch-up contribution limit for IRAs\n27 The EBRI/ICI 401(k) Accumulation Projection Model demonstrates the increases in retirement income that can result\nfrom automatic enrollment. Replacement rates, modeled after adding automatic enrollment and investing contributions in a\ntarget date fund, increase significantly.

    "Page_18": "should be indexed for inflation for the same reason—so that workers' ability to save for their future is\nnot eroded by increases in the cost of living.\nConsolidate Notices. Over the years, the number of notices that must be provided to\nparticipants and beneficiaries has exploded. When ERISA was enacted in 1974, Congres intended\nthat one document—the summary plan description—would be the notice that informed participants\nof their rights and obligations. Since then, a large number of additional notices have been imposed on\nretirement plans. These include various safe harbor notices, the qualified default investment\nalternative (QDIA) notice, and fee disclosures for participant-directed plans. Many of these notices\nmust be provided upon enrollment and annually thereafter, although the specific timing requirements\nvary according to applicable regulations. In implementing these rules, DOL and the Treasury have\nexplicitly or implicitly discouraged combining these notices, even though together the notices provide\ninterrelated information about a 401(k) plan's features. This discourages an integrated\ncommunication approach, complicates plan administration, and inundates participants with\ninformation. Particularly with technical materials, more is often less, and the proliferation of notices,\nsent at different times, may serve to confuse many participants and cause many notices to be\noverlooked. We propose permiting plans to use a single notice (which could be referred to as the\n\"Quick Start\" notice) that would combine the information currently required under various separate\nrules, including the QDIA notice, participant fee disclosures, 401(k) safe harbor notice, automatic\ncontribution arrangement notices, and investment advice notices.28 The proposal also would eliminate\ncertain redundant or irrelevant notices, such as the summary annual report and deferred vested\npension statement.\nhow performance information for target date funds must be compared to a benchmark, in order to\nsimplify and make these benchmark comparisons more understandable to participants.\nPermit Greater Flexibility for Savers. Two of our reform proposals would provide individuals\nwith more flexibility to manage their retirement savings in a way that best meets their own individual\nneeds. First, our proposal would amend the Code to increase the required beginning age for required\nminimum distributions (RMDs) from 70% to at least 75, to reflect changing patterns of retirement\nsavings and increases to life expectancy. Second, we support eliminating the maximum age for making\ntraditional IRA contributions. Currently, individuals who reach age 70% before the close of a taxable\nyear may not make contributions to a traditional IRA for that year (or subsequent years). In view of the\nvariability in how individuals save throughout their working lives, increases to life expectancy, and the\ncorresponding potential for individuals to continue working past traditional retirement age, the law\nshould not prevent workers aged 70% and older from continuing to save for retirement.\nImprove plan administration. Improvements can be made to the way plans are administered,\nand our proposals would ease the complicated administrative burdens that have accumulated over the\n28 See ICI Letter to ERISA Advisory Council, dated August 18, 2017, available at www.ici.org/pdf/30844a.pdf.\n17",
    "Page_19": "years as the legal landscape has changed. We believe that the following changes would improve plan\nadministration and therefore reduce the compliance costs associated with plan sponsorship. For\nexample, we support expanding the IRS compliance program to better address common errors that are\nrelatively easy to fix, such as allowing plans to self-correct plan loan errors and missed RMD payments\nand expanding the compliance program to IRAs. In addition, our proposal would fix a problematic\naspect of current 403(b) plan regulations that, in some situations, can prevent an employer from\neffectively terminating its 403(b) plan (even if, for example, the sponsoring employer goes out of\nbusiness).\nPreserve Social Security. The Institute also recognizes the significance of Social Security as the\nfoundation of retirement security for almost all American workers. We urge Congress to preserve Social\nSecurity as a universal, employment-based, progressive basic pension for all Americans.\ns o on aiuddo u iou no yuy I 'sioquu ino yo le pue nsu o jo geyoq u\n statement.

    "Page_58": "5/11/18\nEXPAND COVERAGE:\nESTABLISHNEW SIMPLER PLAN DESIGN\nC urrent L aw\nSmall employers have many different plan options to choose from: payroll-deduction IRAs, SEP\nIRAs (which allow only employer contributions), SIMPLE IRAs or SIMPLE 401(k) plans, as\nwell as full-blown tax-qualified plans such as 401(k), profit-sharing, or defined benefit plans.\nOne such option—the SIMPLE IRA plan—is, as its name implies, a very simple plan to establish\nand maintain. It also has attractive employee contribution limits as compared to a regular\ntraditional or Roth IRA ($12,500 vs. $5,500 in 2018). Under Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\")\n$408(p), employers with 100 or fewer employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation\nfrom the employer in the prior year may establish a SIMPLE IRA plan. The employer may not\nmaintain any other retirement plan while maintaining a SIMPLE IRA plan. The employer can\nchoose to cover all employees or only employees who received at least $5,0oo in compensation\nduring any two prior years and are reasonably expected to receive at least $5,0o0 during the\ncurrent year. Employees may contribute up to $12,500 in 2018 (plus a $3,000 catch-up\ncontribution for individuals age 50 or older). Employers must either match employee\ncontributions 100 percent up to 3 percent of compensation or make a nonelective contribution of\n2 percent of each eligible employee's compensation. All contributions must be fully vested.\nEach year, employees must receive notice of their rights under the plan, an election form, and a\nsummary description. There is no annual reporting required (such as Form 5500), beyond\nreporting participation and contributions on an employee's W-2. The IRS provides model forms\nfor establishment of a SIMPLE IRA plan, including a model notice to eligible employees and a\nmodel salary reduction agreement (see Forms 5304-SIMPLE and 5305-SIMPLE). Many\nfinancial institutions offering SIMPLE IRA plans use the IRS forms (although they could instead\nprovide their own plan document). SIMPLE IRA plans generally are subject to Title I of the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA'\"), but have more limited fiduciary\nobligations than a 401(k) plan for example.\n Need for Improvement\nWhile the SIMPLE IRA and many other plan options offer a relatively simple solution to plan\nsponsorship, none of the existing plan options work well for workplaces where the majority of\nworkers are focused on saving for goals other than retirement —such as education, a home, or an\na 401(k) or similar plan, but cannot meet the non-discrimination tests and do not have the\ncapacity to make the required employer contributions associated with the safe harbor 401(k) plan\nor a SIMPLE plan. For employers whose workforce places less value on compensation paid as\nretirement benefits, the required employer contributions discourage the adoption of SIMPLE\nplans.\n3",
    "Page_59": "5/11/18\nProposal\nWe propose a very modest change to current law that would build on the existing framework for\nSIMPLE plans.1 In its simplest form, the new plan would work the same as the SIMPLE IRA,\nexcept that employer contributions would not be required and the employee deferral limit would\nbe set lower than that for SIMPLE IRAs ($12,500 for 2018), but higher than the regular IRA\n$408(p) (Simple Retirement A ccounts) to add an option with no employer contribution required\nand lower deferral limits.

The rule is intended to ensure\nthat all participants in such plans have the information they need to make informed decisions\nabout the management of their individual accounts and the investment of their retirement\nsavings. The regulation includes a requirement that the historical performance (1-, 5-, and 10-\nyear returns) for each designated investment altermative for which the return is not fixed, be\ncompared to an appropriate broad-based securities market index.5 For example, for an equity\nfund, a plan would provide participants the 1-, 5-, and 10-year returns of the equity fund,\nalongside returns of an appropriate broad-based index (like the S&P 500, which represents the\nsame asset class). This rule does not specifically address investments like target date funds that\ninclude a mix of asset classes. In the preamble to the final regulation and subsequent interpretive\nguidance,6 DOL indicated that a plan could provide the required benchmark and additional\nbenchmarks, so long as the additional benchmarks are not inaccurate or misleading. For\nexample, for an investment option that has a mix of asset classes, an additional benchmark could\nbe created by blending the returns of more than one appropriate broad-based securities market\nindex. (The blended benchmark must proportionally reflect the actual holdings of the investment\noption.） The DOL benchmarking rule is based on a similar requirement under the securities laws\nfor mutual fund prospectuses,7 which requires a fund (in its prospectus) to compare its\nperformance to an appropriate broad-based securities market index and allows comparison to\nanother broad-based index, so long as the comparison is not misleading. In order to provide a\nblended benchmark index for a given investment option, if there is no appropriate broad-based\nindex that reflects a mix of asset classes, the disclosure materials may need to include at least\ntwo different benchmarks for the option, which could confuse participants and unnecessarily\nlengthen the disclosure.\n Need for Improvement\nIn the context of DOL's participant disclosure rule (in which key information, such as\n performance and fees, about each designated investment option under a plan must be provided in\n5 DOL Reg. s 2550.404a-5(d)(1)(iii).\n6 See 75 Fed.

For the first time, the regulations provided that a 403(b) plan may be terminated\nBut the regulations provide only limited guidance regarding the mechanics of plan termination.\nWhen a 403(b) plan is invested in annuities, the termination can occur through distribution of a\nfully paid annuity contract to the participants. When the 403(b) plan is invested in regulated\ninvestment companies in a custodial account (as the Code allows), the administrative process is\nmore difficult. W hen a participant can be located and responds to communication from the plan,\nthe account can be rolled over into an IRA. It is inevitable, however, that there will be\nparticipants who are either not located or unwilling to voluntarily liquidate their existing 403(b)\naccounts, perhaps because they prefer their current investment provider or because of sales\ncharges. The problem of missing participants is particularly problematic in the context of 403(b)\nplans because these plans are often funded through a number of different vendors. Many\nparticipants will hold contracts issued by vendors that do not have a current relationship with the\nemployers. The IRS issued a ruling in 2011 (Rev. Rul. 2011-7) that appears to require an\nelection by the participant to distribute funds in the custodial account, which is often not possible\nto obtain.\n Need for Improvement\nUnlike with 401(k) and other qualified plans, the Code does not provide a process for\nterminating 403(b) plans, which has left the IRS with little guidance. Providing an orderly\nprocess for termination which protects participants and maintains the tax qualified nature of the\naccount is consistent with prior Congressional efforts to harmonize the rules for 403(b) plans\nwith qualified plans. Providing for the “in-kind’ distribution of a custodial account to a\nparticipant upon plan termination, so that the account retains its 403(b) status outside of the plan,\nalso would provide parity for 403(b) participants who invest in mutual fund custodial accounts\nand want to remain invested in the same vehicle after plan termination, just like 403(b) annuity\ncontract holders who can maintain their contract after plan termination.\n18",
    "Page_74": "5/11/18\nProposal\nThe proposal would provide that if an employer terminates a 403(b) plan under which amounts\nthe participant or beneficiary (in which case amounts actually distributed from the account will\nbe taxed in the year in which so distributed under Code section 72, unless rolled over to another\nqualified account). A custodial account would not be considered “distributed to a participant or\n  a   rn s p   s o  r \n ore s   s s  b s p  o po\noriginally opened under a group contract.\n4524, Neal, D-MA). A different proposal relating to 403(b) plan termination appears in the\nRetirement Enhancement and Savings Act of 2018 (S. 2526, Hatch, R-UT and H.R. 5282, Kelly\nR-PA).\nSTRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY:\nPLACE SOCIAL SECURITY ON SOLID FINANCIAL FOOTING\nFOR THEINDEFINITE FUTURE\nThe foregoing proposals would go a long way toward improving the successful defined\ncontribution plan system and better equipping A merican workers with the tools needed to build a\nsecure retirement. A ny assessment of the US retirement system is incomplete, however, without\nrecognizing the significance of Social Security. Social Security provides the foundation of\nretirement security for almost all A merican workers—-for the majority, it may be the largest\nsingle income source in retirement —-and it replaces significant portions of income for lower-\nincome retirees. In this respect, Social Security replaces 85 percent of average inflation-indexed\nannual earnings for workers in the lowest lifetime household earnings quintile; 55 percent for\nworkers in the middle lifetime household earnings quintile; and 34 percent for workers in the\nhighest lifetime household earnings quintile.11 Y et the Social Security system faces a projected\nlong-term imbalance.\nIt is absolutely imperative to preserve Social Security as a universal, employment-based,\nprogressive safety net for all A mericans. ICI urges Congress to strengthen Social Security and\nmaintain its current character. We do not support proposals to transform Social Security benefits\ninto individual private accounts.\n11 Figures represent the mean replacement rates for retired workers in the 1950s birth cohort, assuming the workers\nclaim Social Security benefits at age 65.
