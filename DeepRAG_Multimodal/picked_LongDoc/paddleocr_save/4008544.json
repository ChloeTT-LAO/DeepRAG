In this document, the term 'problem' when used in the context of\ndiagnostics or troubleshooting refers to a 'deviation from a defined target situation with an\nunknown cause'.\nThe aim of this booklet is to describe suitable procedures and methodological resources for an\nanalysis of these causes. The areas of application used for the purpose are both technical and non-\ntechnical products and processes. Moreover, these problems are essentially to be regarded as 'an\n opportunity for improvement' - i.e. beyond the remedying of the deviation, improvements for the\nSOCOS\nproducts and processes looked at are derivable from an understanding of the causes and functions.\nThe complexity of and effort that goes into resolving problems depend, among other things, on the\n-04-06 -\ntiming of the occurrence of the problems (figure 1.1).

In particular, the product engineering approach with regard to well-understood\ncause-effect relationships is formulated here.\n· The procedure for problem solving forms the core of the methodology. The steps correspond to\nthe procedure used in the 8D method (see Appendix 1). They are adapted to the different\nproblem areas (product problems, process problems, problems in the indirect area) and the\ncontents detailed with regard to some subtasks. The basic procedure (see figure 3.2 problem\nsolving funnel) can be applied, however, regardless of complexity and the problem area.\n· Individual methods (e.g. a matrix for collecting the facts, question models for deriving possible\ncauses, etc.) and documents (e.g. problem solving sheets) support the aforementioned subtasks.\n@ Robert Bosch GmbH | 05.2013",

By demanding defined, methodologically supported subtasks,\nafforded by solutions to problems are shown to the associates, thereby promoting ongoing change\n(\"as a manager I cannot delegate my responsibility for solving problems\").\nInvolvement, responsibility and the will to improve can be clearly observed in how consequent the\nprocedure is implemented. The second block of principles is written with the procedural problem\nsolving objective: \"I want to understand the problem and its causes fundamentally\". Understanding\nand describing the problem in detail and a grasp of the underlying causes are essential prerequisites\nfor effective and efficient measures to deal with that problem.\n SOCOS\nThe associated principles characterize the essential steps that constitute the procedure.

The exchange of information\n2020-\nbetween the persons affected and those involved in the problem solving process is facilitated by\nmaintaining a presence at the site of the cause (the 'place of action') and/or at the place where the\nproblem was discovered (the 'place of finding'))\nlocations - it is absolutely essential that information is clear, consolidated, and structured (\"I describe\nthe problem in comprehensible form for all parties involved\"). This involves first and foremost an\noverall description of the facts, e.g. in the form of diagrams, process charts and graphical evaluations.\nThe crucial step in solving a problem is a logical analysis that substantiates clear description of the\nunderlying causes. In this respect it is important to determine the factors connected with the cause\nof the problem and to describe their function (\"I understand the problem and how it occurs trough\ninvestigation of the relevant cause and effect relationships \").\nThe third block of principles addresses the quality, durability and transferability of the solution\ndeveloped (\"The problems we solve do not reoccur\"). The prerequisite for sustainable solutions is a\nfar-reaching cause analysis which also takes into account relationships across specialist area and\nthe technical and systemic perspectives\").\nThe cause-effect relationships determined are to be proven based on real conditions and, in terms of\neffects, evaluated beyond the problem area (\"We provide evidence of the problem solving effect\nand understand their consequences\").

    "Page_10": "Problem Solving\nThe first - problem-oriented - part of the problem solving funnel begins in a precise, textual,\ndescription of the problem (chronologically, geographically, quantitatively, etc.) - the so-called \nfundamental problem. The necessity to formulate the problem as accurately as possible in one or\nmore sentences calls for a reflective discussion within the team. The fundamental problem forms the\nentry into the second, cause-oriented part of the procedure.\n Experience shows that several fundamental problems can arise, particularly where the problems are\ndescribed in very vague terms and/or are complex. In such cases, it must be checked to what extent\nthese fundamental problems are really independent of one another, and whether a separate cause\nanalysis is possible. Specifically at the transition from the problem- to the cause-oriented part it has\nto be pointed out that although the procedure is described in a forward direction, in a specific\napplication case recurrences are unavoidable - which may even be helpful in the context of a target-\nan example.\n- SOCOS\nAs part of the cause-effect analysis (D4), initially fundamental considerations (section 5.3.1)\nsub-step 6) are carried out, which means detecting the cause-effect-relationships and deviations\n2020-04-06 - S\n(ls/ls not).

Crucial in\nthis respect is an in-depth understanding of the combined effect of the conditions and/or the\no  nba da e o o   - pad a   suos\ncombination of causative (collaborative) parameters or the root causes and their interaction - e.g. an\nincreased stress with, at the same time, reduced strength (see section 5.3.1).\nOnce the technical root cause (TRC) is found after proving the connection between the causing\nconditions, the following question has to be raised:\n·Why was the problem not detected?\n First, this questions should be answered technically, e.g. product audits. By observing deeply it is\ncause). The '5xwhy' method is also suitable for this purpose.\ncomparable cases.

In any event, it is absolutely imperative to investigate such\nsuspicions (hypotheses or \"initial suspicion\") by corresponding querying in the context of the\nrelationships understood (collaborating and permitting). In these cases, too, the key evidence (why\nand how) must be produced. Essentially there is a danger that the path of gradual localization of the\nproblem (problem solving funnel) is abandoned.

The number\n5 is merely an empirical value that has given rise to the name of the method. The required number of\nwhy steps depends, among other things, on the starting point, the complexity of the problem, and \nthe discipline and experience of the users.\nThe possible measures for resolving the problem vary greatly after each why step - i.e. increasing\ndepth of the cause analysis - in terms of the nature and importance of the problem. The deeper the\nanalysis, the more far-reaching are the measures. Crucial when searching for the cause of the\nproblem is the question of whether the corresponding measure rules out any risk of the problem\nrecurring.

The aim is to localize the fundamental problem being\nprocessed by a clear description which structures the symptoms (chronologically, regionally,\nquantitatively, etc.) and by clear demarcation of the areas not affected by the problem (figure 5.9).\nThe sub-steps 1 to 5 explain the problem description and its methodical aids: visualizations, analysis\nof the object, structure and/or system structure, process description and collection of facts.

This way of looking at the situation is based on the approach of Bosch Product\nSOCOS\nEngineering.

This knowledge should be prepared and communicated accordingly. This rule\napplies to both knowledge of product or process development and to knowledge that arises from\nsolving problems. That is why problem solving is specifically interlinked with the knowledge\nmanagement approaches in the Bosch Product Engineering System (BES-KM) [BES-12].\nAfter solving a product/process problem, the knowledge is available in the form of descriptions of\nTechnical Root Causes (TRC), Managerial Root Causes (MRC), cause-effect relationships and\nmeasures. In order for the knowledge to be used across the organization, the lessons learned from\ndoing so, there are five elements necessary (figure 6.1):\nSOCOS\n●Description\nDistribution (\"push\")\n-04-06-\nStandards\n·\n2020-\nAccess (\"pull\")\n●Networks\n...toabroadbase\nfrom a\nsingle case\nDescription\nLL distribution\nStandards\n-friendly\nspread information\ninformation \"pull*\nS standards\n\"push\" with feedback\nfilter by categori\nnended actions\norganization standards\nrecomr\nwhat to do? / what not do?\nNetworksDistribution,\nFigure 6.1: Elements of Lessons Learned\nThe requirement when preparing Lessons Learned is an understandable description (product-neutral\nand technical terminology) of cause-effect relationships and the formulation of instructions.

The following key\nquestions may be helpful: \"what else can the problem affect?\", \"where else can the problem\noccur?\", \"when could the problem occur again?\", \"who else can cause the problem?\", \"How much\nmore damage can the problem cause?\" (figure 6.2).\ncan\nhints / explanations\n？\nthe problem\n(consider logic \"can not\")\nadditionally\nSimilar applications regarding system/ product /\nwhat\naffect?\ndesign elements / technology / production / assembly /\nprocess / method / business process \nOther production lines, plants, development locations,\nwhere\noccur?\nregions, climate, products, platforms, customer\napplic ations, us age ..\nNew production ines, plants, development locations,\nwhen\noccur?\n SOCOS\nregions, climate, products, platforms, customer\napplic ations, usage ..\ncause?\nOther/new:supplier,associate/manager/process\n(Who else can be\now ner / user, trainer, ...\nwho\n-04-06\naffected by the\nproblem?)\n2020-\nhow many\ndamage?\nRisk assessment, priorities\nD istribute to:\nFigure 6.2: Questions to identify recipients\nOnce they have been prepared, Lessons Learned must be actively distributed (\"Push\"). The best way\nof sharing Lessons Learned is personal communication, e.g. regular meetings. Feedback on the\napplicability and, if relevant, implementation of Lessons Learned in the operating unit or in the\nrecipient's working environment is useful. For important cases, tracking of distributed cases has been\nproven to work in practice. To ensure further distribution Lessons Learned cases are typically\nprovided in the form of a database.\nStandards that result from implementation provide a basis for avoiding errors across the\norganization (e.g. design of standards, design guidelines, layout guidelines, process and production \nstandards, standard training). Improving an existing standard is just as likely to achieve the goal as\ncreating a new one.\nFinally, the cause-effect relationships that have been learned and the organizational standards that \nhave been developed are made available on a permanent basis. In the same way that knowledge is\nsent, databases are used to enable organizational access to the knowledge (\"Pull\").\nProvision of (knowledge) networks is essential to exchanging, completing and implementing Lessons\nLearned. These networks include manufacturing networks, working groups (BEO-AK), Centers of\nCompetence (CoC), Lessons Learned networks and PS networks.\nAs already mentioned in the principles (chapter 2), executives and managers are required to take an\nactive role. Regarding Lessons Learned this includes leading associates through Lessons Learned,\ncontributing their own personal expertise and making decisions about how to implement standards.\nManagerial participation is fundamental to the success of Lessons Learned.\n For practical implementation purposes, the procedure is summarized in a guideline for step D7 of \nLessons Learned and is divided into four tasks/sub-steps (see figure 6.3).\n@ Robert Bosch GmbH | 05.2013\n41",

All 8 steps are to be\nprocessed within the problem solving. As needed the steps have to be run through recursive, i.e. the\n8D method is set up new at a previous point with known and secured facts.

In addition, it must be ensured that information about the non-\nconformity is forwarded within the affected area (e.g. next shift) as well as to potential affected\nareas (e.g. other lines/plants). Containment actions must be documented together with the\nassociated results. If no containment actions are possible, this has to be justified and to be\ndocumented. Before containment actions are implemented possible unrequested side effects should\nbe assessed.\nResult: Implemented Containment Actions incl. documentation and information\nRobertBosch GmbH|05.2013\n53",
