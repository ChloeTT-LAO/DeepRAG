The act provided for flats to be purchased\ndirectly by the tenants, but in the entire East Germany,\nonly 20 per cent of flats sold in this way ended up in the\nhands of their occupants; in Berlin the figure was only\n5-6 per cent. A total of 277,0oo apartments in the former\nEast Germany - including 46,ooo in the eastern part of\nBerlin - were privatized at that time.31 The sale of coun-\ncil flats also covered West Berlin.

The\nresidents of Berlin began to split into those with the old\nlease agreements, and those with the new ones, as each\nre-letting of the apartment allows the owner to increase\nthe rent. Currently, those who wish to rent an apartment\nhave to pay much more than those who have been rent-\ning for years. People of limited financial means often\nrestore to looking for a place on the outskirts of the city.\nFor incumbent Berliners, “luxury renovations\" present\na big problem. The owners of tenement houses carry\nout modernization (for example, they add balconies and\ninstall elevators), and the costs - usually high - can later\nbe incorporated in the rent. Legally, the city can pre-\nvent this type of investment from happening - among\nothers, thanks to the Milieuschutz (community protec-\ntion) program, which covers the areas threatened with\ngentrification. The goal is to protect the tenants against\nmoving out; investors are required to get approval for all\n renovation works from the city planning office.\nAnother strategy is the extremely costly repurchase\n of former council housing by the city.

    "Page_65": "clear zoning of public, semi-public, and private spaces,\nproviding conditions for observing all areas of the\nestate, and eliminating objects that could be used as\nsteps in a ladder, thus allowing an intruder to climb to\nhigher floors. In short: the spatial solutions proposed by\nNewman are meant to result in specific behaviours of\nthe users.\n On the basis of Newman's theory, many programs\nwere created, recommended by city planners and\npolicemen,16 including Secured by Design - the offcial\nprogram of the British police, and the CPTED program\n(Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design),\nwhich comes from the United States, widely promoted\nby the international non-governmental organization\ncalled the ICA (International CPTED Association)17. ICA\nled to the publication of the ISO standard on CPTED in\nJanuary 2021 (ISO 22341:2021). Although the American\nversion focuses on spatial issues, it also emphasizes the\nimportance of a strong local community. In the second\ngeneration of CPTED rules (the first one contained\nspatial and technical solutions, also regarding access\nlimitation), it was described, for example, how to organ-\nize a neighbourhood watch. It is difficult to shake off the\nimpression that the proposed remedy may become a\n disease at some point. The problem was noticed, among\nothers, by Bryan Lee Jr., a black designer from New\nOrleans who deals with the concept of just city'. Lee\nbelieves that security mechanisms based on neigh-\nbourly control and the assumption that any person with\nAWARIA\n antisocial intentions should feel uncomfortable may\nOBIEKT\nFURTKI\nMONITOROWAN\ncause discomfort to anyone who looks different and\ndoes not conform to normative patterns or - what is par-\nOEFENBOR\nticularly important in the United States - has a different \ncoloured skin.18 The strategy promoted by the CPTED\nthreatens to deepen the divisions between “us\"” and\n\"them\" and reinforce the not-in-my-backyard phenom-\nenon, i.e. the opposition of residents to certain invest-\nments (for example shelters for people experiencing \nhomelessness crisis, or counselling centres for people\nwith addictions) in their immediate vicinity, although\nthey do not deny that these facilities are needed.\nThe concept of design influencing user behaviour\ncan also lead to abuse. After all, this includes the con-\ntroversial hostile design', i.e. elements used in public\nspace that are supposed to modify human behaviour,\nfor example, prevent the homeless from lying on park\nbenches. It is difficult to precisely answer the question\nof when the applied elements help maintain security,\nand when they serve to divide and exclude.\nTherefore, this solution cannot be considered effec-\ntive either. Focusing on one narrative does not lead to\nobtaining answers to other narratives; worse, it provokes\nsituations that, according to subsequent narratives, may\nbe considered problematic.
