It is available primarily for the use in church schooling\nWhy this publication? In many homes there are children of different ages and insight\nsecond reason is that there are many adults whose second language is English, and\nThere are omissions, where certain concepts are quite difficult to understand. I am\nconvinced that these omissions will not weaken the foundation necessary to built the\nfaith of the children.\nI had the privilege to work though many translations of the catechism in English,\nAfrikaans and Dutch. The references to Scripture is the result of comparing these\ntranslations as well as the work by Zacharias Ursinus \"Het Schatboek der\nverklaringenoverdeHeidelbergseCatechismus\"\nIt is my sincere wish that this publication will lead the Lord's children into the truths\nof the reformed theology.\nHennievanWyk\nBloemhof, 2016",
