Other\ncommentators are more optimistic and foresee an impending technological revolution that\nwill radically transform every aspect of our lives. What is certain is that the field of human\naugmentation has the potential to transform society, security and defence over the next\n30 years. We must begin to understand the implications of these changes and shape\nthem to our advantage now, before they are thrust upon us.\nTechnology in warfare has traditionally centred on increasingly sophisticated platforms that\npeople move and fight from, or artefacts that they wear or wield to fight with. Advances\nin the life sciences and converging developments in related fields are, however, beginning\nbeen given to what this means for artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, but\nThis project seeks to address this imbalance so that we can understand the potential of \nhuman augmentation and its implications.\nThe project is a bilateral cooperation between Bundeswehr Ofice for Defence Planning\nin Germany and the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre in the UK. The output\nfrom the strategic implications project will be relevant to a wide audience across the\ndefence and security sector. Whilst this is not a scientific publication, it draws extensively\non research to provide an overview of where the key opportunities and threats are.\nMany technologies that have the potential to deliver strategic advantage out to 2050\nalready exist and further advances will undoubtedly occur.

Human\naugmentation is the missing part of this puzzle.\nThinking of the person as a platform and understanding our people at an individual level\nis fundamental to successful human augmentation. Industrial Age warfare saw people\nas interchangeable components of military units or the material with which to operate\nthe platforms - vehicles, aircraft and ships. These platforms are routinely monitored and\nanalysed but it is remarkable that our ability to understand our most critical capability -\nthe human - is so under-researched.

Other options include use of substances, for instance, anabolic drugs are a \nknown performance enhancer allowing individuals to train more efficiently, ultimately to\nexceed their physical potential.\nExoskeletons\nAn exoskeleton is an external,\n removable structure capable\nof supporting the human\nmusculoskeletal system.

A light\nversion of the full body system is the lower extremity exoskeleton aiming at reducing the\nloads on the knees as well as energy consumption during walking and running. There\nhas been significant interest in exoskeletons, mainly for therapy and mobility rather than\naugmentation, but with some explicit military applications intended to reduce fatigue\n 53 Bostrom, N., (2003), The Journal of Value Inquiry, “Human genetic enhancements: a transhumanist\nperspective'\nHuman Augmentation - The Dawn of a New Paradigm\n85",

Potential limitations include constraints on speed and range\nsupplies and connectivity. A related technology is the robotic glove capable of providing\nadditional grip strength. The purpose of the glove is to reduce injuries caused by muscle\nstrain as well as reducing fatigue when performing repetitive tasks.55\nExoskeletons could be playing a role on the battlefield by 2030. Some might be designed\nshocks for those working on board ships or other vehicles. It is less clear that powered\nsystems will be widely used, although they could be used for situations that only require\nmovement over short distances but need heavy protection.

The risk of not exploring\nthe potential of exoskeletons is that the opponent will acquire the technology first:\nincreasing their lethality, mobility and protection.\nSubstances\nSubstances are likely to continue to be used to enhance physical performance.

States are also\ninterested in having a healthy population with high human capital and low health care\non finding ways to extend the years of good health. At present, most efforts have\nbeen focused on age-related disease rather than ageing itself. Interventions in the time\nframe of 2050 are most likely to focus on countering the damaging effects of ageing,\nrather than the causes of ageing.116 Interventions include replacing joints, improving\nmetabolism, treating and preventing cancer, boosting the immune system and developing\nsenolytic drugs, (drugs that remove aged cells).17 Methods to reduce genetic damage,\nand improved mitochondrial function are also likely to be developed. It is probable that\nmany, if not all, of these methods will need to be applied in combination to fully remove\nagainst the causes of ageing (a real 'cure') are likely to require a much deeper\nunderstanding of biology than we currently have, and probably a redesign of key genetic\nprograms. Life extension is an area of augmentation where significant DlY biology activity\ndevelopments.\nSection 7 - Future potential\nof the body may have significant consequences elsewhere. The precise effect that can\nbe obtained from existing as well as potential technologies are often unknown or poorly\ndocumented. One example is the long chain of events that causes physical exercise\n113  Kozai, T. D.

Thus, research efforts which aim to investigate and document the\neffects of even well-established substances are warranted. This is particularly important\nin the context of precision medicine (the optimisation of health measures on an individual\nbasis).\nResearch in other fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, will also have\nthat superhuman cognitive ability can be achieved biomedically, collaboration with artificial\nmental tasks to be offloaded to computers. For example, numerical calculations and\nsimulations could be triggered by thought and the results made mentally available;\nalthough, the effectiveness of such collaboration depends both on the suitability of tasks\nand how open-ended the system is.\nAdvancements in four related fields of technology,\n known collectively as nanotechnology, biology,\ninformation technology, and cognitive science\n(NBIC) are expected to converge, and ultimately\nunify, leading to radical improvements in human\nperformance through the integration of these\ntechnologies. The combination of precision\nmedicine, nutrition, and training could open\nup entirely new possibilities. For example,\nin bodybuilding and powerlifting, focus on\noptimising the training routines are also being matched with nutrition and sleep regimes\npossibilities to improve the performance of the group as well as the individual.\nThe key to developing effective human augmentation is an improved understanding of\naccess to, and analysis of, personal data: whether it is psychophysiological variables,\ncollection of personal reference data, analysis of medical markers, or supervision of\ntraining routines. Only if these building blocks are put in place, will there be enough\nunderstanding to ensure that human augmentations can be made precisely and with\nscience of human augmentation arrive.\nPredicting the future is challenging. Initially promising solutions may reach dead ends and\nattitudes towards new technology will affect rate of acceptance within society.
