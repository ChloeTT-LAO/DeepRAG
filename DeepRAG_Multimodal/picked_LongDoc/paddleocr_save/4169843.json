Copies of the NDR application documents can be found at www.resilientshelby.com Also, as described in the NDR Phase 2\napplication, both Memphis and Shelby County are committed to carrying out Fair Housing activities. Shelby County's Department of Housing,\na partner team member in the NDR application, is the County agency operating HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD)\nentitlement grants and oversees housing programs which directly impact LMI residents which include infrastructure development, housing \ncounseling. Likewise, the City of Memphis, a partner in the NDR application operates similar activities through its Division of Housing and \nCommunity Development. Both agencies are currently working to promote Fair Housing and Fair Housing Initiatives under their Fair Housing\nAssessments. Additionally, as part of the GREENPRINT, the Memphis Shelby County Office of Sustainability completed a Fair Housing\nEquity Assessment (FHEA) in partnership SCDH, HCD, community and business leaders and other housing partners and addressed fair\nhousing impediments under the Greenprint and recommended various solutions to improve fair housing education and compliance. Under \nHCD, and the Greenprint's FHEA to further assess Fair Housing impediments and incorporate Fair Housing initiatives into the NDR Resiliency\nPlan and the NDR projects in North (Big Creek), Central (Wolf River Greenway), and South (Cypress Creek) Shelby County. Currently, efforts\nare underway by Memphis and Shelby County to develop a new AFH Plan under new Fair Housing guidelines by 2018 to more effectively\ncarryout Fair Housing initiatives on a joint/countywide basis in order to more efficiently address fair housing issue. The NDR administrative\nstaff will work directly with SCDH, HCD, the Office of Sustainability to insure that Fair Housing is a key component of the NDR Resiliency Plan,\n2). The NDR team understands that long term resiliency, social, economic, and environmental issues are a part of any long term Fair Housing\nInitiatives. Through the activities of the NDR grant; and both Memphis and Shelby County's HUD funded grants (CDBG, HOME, Lead Hazard \nControl, etc.) Shelby County will insure that fair housing is a central part of long term resilience efforts resulting from NDR efforts and\nExecutive Summary:\nresilient community both locally and regionally.

In Phase 2, the County identified three target areas that were hardest hit by the 2011 disasters:\nalong Big Creek (Northern Shelby County), the Wolf River (Central Shelby County),\n2\nCommunity Development Systems\nDisaster Recovery Grant Reporting System(DRGR)",
    "Page_3": "and South Cypress Creek (Southern Shelby County). Activities within these areas will create additional greenway trails and enhanced\nrecreation areas as well as areas for local food production. A fourth activity will create a Regional Resilience Plan (which includes a hydraulic\nGREENPRINT, which was developed with the support of a HUD Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant. Each of these activities \nwill lead to replicable interventions that will be transferrable to other areas throughout the region. Furthermore, the goal of each activity was to\nensure that the designs are not only cost effective; but provide the highest resilience value (i.e. social, economic, environmental, etc.) and \nensure that the proposed resilience solutions within the activities are both scalable and replicable throughout the region. Activity 1: Big Creek\nWetland and Recreation Area. Located in North Shelby County within the City of Millington, this area is home to a high percentage of LMI\nCreek, and culminating at Hwy 51 North on the West. The overall service area is composed of the following Census Tracts: 0201.02 Block\nGroup 1 0201.02 Block Group 20202.10 Block Group 1 0202.10 Block Group 2 0202.10 Block Group 30202.10 Block Group 4 0202.21 Block\ncontrol practice common to the Corps of Engineers, the primary activity will create a new floodplain by lowering an area along the creek to\nflooding in adjacent communities.

If this activity had been complete prior to the May 2010 floods, $79\nwetlands, and other natural features.

Chickasaw Basin Authority (CBA), also a partner in Phase 3, was created as a State of Tennessee Agency as the Regional Development\nAuthority for the Chickasaw Basin in Tennessee. The CBA develops flood control projects in the Loosahatchie and Wolf Rivers and\nNonconnah Creek watersheds. The CBA is authorized by the State of Tennessee by TCA 64-1-201. Its role under Phase 3 willbe to assist\nShelby County and other partners in securing support and approval for wetland restoration activities under the Big Creek Wetland and\nRestoration Activity; an area within Shelby County where the CBA has been very active in developing flood control methodology and projects.\n12. The University of Tennessee Agricultural Extension, a partner in Phase 3; provides a gateway to the University of Tennessee as the\noutreach unit of the Institute of Agriculture. UT Extension delivers educational programs and research-based information to citizens throughout \nthe state. Additionally, in cooperation with Tennessee State University, UT Extension works with farmers, families, youth and communities to\nimprove lives by addressing problems and issues at the local, state and national levels. As a partner to Shelby County in implementing the \nNDR award, UT Extension's role will be to serve as a resource in the development of community programs (especially in Big Creek and South \nCypress Creek) which will educate the community about food and gardening and the creation of community gardens as alternative food\nsources within the community.\n13. Memphis Center for Food and Faith (MCFF) and Grow Memphis (which recently merged to become Memphis Tilth) are local nonprofit\norganizations identified in Phase 2 who will work with Shelby County during Phase 3 implementation to engage in urban agriculture and\ncommunity gardening activities designed to bring fresh and healthy food alternatives to citizens residing in the Big Creek and South Cypress\nCreek communities. As partners, they will work to establish community gardens and healthy food options for these areas to enhance greater\naccess to fresh food.\n14. The Hyde Family Foundations (a local philanthropy) and the Greater Memphis Chamber gifted $157,000 and $57,000 respectively to\nsupport a coordinator position to transition the GREENPRINT from plan to implementation.

Two of the NDR activities (Wolf River and South Cypress Creek) are directly located within the Memphis city limits. Under Phase 3,\nMemphis will play a key role in assisting in the overall design and implementation of the both of these projects. As a partner in the NDR grant,\nMemphis is providing a total of $4,100,0o0 in direct leverage through its Public Works Division and Division of Housing and Community\nDevelopment (HCD). This leverage can be broken out as follows: $2,500,000 for the Wolf River Wetland and Restoration and $1,600,000 for\napplication and activities by providing $34,423,302 for construction and completion of the Main-to-Main Multimodal Connector P roject \nacross the Mississippi River; which furthers regional interconnectedness of the Greenprint.\n3.
