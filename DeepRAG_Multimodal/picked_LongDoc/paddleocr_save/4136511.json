Despite the diversity of national circumstances and\nexperts' backgrounds, the main results converged to identify a small number of\ncontextual factors that were observed in multiple case studies and acknowledged to\naffect adoption or/and implementation of policy instruments such as Feed-In-Tariffs.\nThese are the presence of a technological innovation system with an emphasis on the\ndecrease of technology costs, the market and regulatory framework, especially the\nstructure of the electricity market and the presence of the EU regulatory framework,\npolicy continuity, and the macro-environment with a reference to economic crisis, all\nattitudes, behaviour and lifestyle.\nThese case studies contributed to filling the knowledge gaps with help of informed\nexperts and disseminating results to the public.

The strategy was followed by\nthe launch of the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) resulting in a set of\nmitigation.1 The identification of these measures, including emissions trading and energy\nefficiency (EE), led to further research and introduction of EU legislation to be transposed\nand implemented at a member state level. The 2020 climate and energy package\nadopted in 2oo9 was a turning point where climate and energy policies were integrated\nand presented as a package of targets and measures for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission\nlargely maintained in the Energy Union package towards 2030.\nOne of the understandings widely shared among practitioners and researchers through\nthis experience in the EU is that depending on the context, policies do not necessarily\nwork as anticipated or expected from the aims, structure or designs of specific policy\ninstruments or mechanisms. It is however possible that under certain conditions, policies\ncan meet their stated aim and deliver expected results, and policy instruments can\nfunction to their best ability. In this report, \"contextual factors\" imply such conditions\nS           \nMore specifically, they refer to context-specific drivers or barriers to adoption or\nimplementation of specific policy instruments. While this report discusses the specific\ncases of RE or smart technologies for EE including and smart grids (for justification of the\nchoice of these cases, please see Section 2.1), the emphasis of the analysis is placed on\nmeasures to support such technologies rather than technologies themselves.\nThis report builds on the previous work in the CARISMA Discussion Paper Contextual\nfactors affecting EU climate policies and their outcomes (Fujiwara, Tuerk, Spyridaki and\nWilliges, 2017) via use of a set of case studies focused on RE or EE policies in a range of\ncountries, mainly EU member states. The discussion paper provides an introduction to\nthe concept of contextual factors, the institutional, economic and social contexts which\ninfluence the formulation and implementation of climate policy instruments. Fujiwara,\nTuerk, Spyridaki and Williges (2017) outline a set of contextual factors which fit into\nthree broad categories, institutions and governance, innovation and investment, and\nattitudes and lifestyle, conveying a range of factors as shown in Table 1. These formed\nthe basis for stakeholder discussion within the case studies, as described in the\nremainder of this report.\n1 The first ECCP was implemented with eleven working groups of experts in 2000-2004.

The case presents lessons learned from\nstakeholders interviewed in relation to the pilot projects and their effects on the\n s        s     i s\nfuture smart grids policy.\nThe Croatian case study focused on the buildup of renewable energy capacity in the\n  n s  (o    o     o\nthe state's energy strategy and policy, which fluctuated (sometimes significantly) over\n  a s   o   g a     \nresponsibilities into two different ministries, a perceived lack of transparency in\npolicymaking, and little room for growth of RE under certain support schemes.\nThe UK case study attempted to shed some light on difficulties with renewable support\npolicies and on what kind of contextual factors may have influenced the performance of\nthe its Renewable Obligation (RO) and feed-in-tariff (FiT) support instruments. While the\nUK has had success in increasing its share of renewables in the electricity mix, it has not\nseen similar success decarbonizing its heat and transport sectors, resulting in the country\nbeing projected to miss its EU target of 15% renewables in final energy consumption.\nWhile the increase in share of renewable energy in power production (from under 5% in\n2005 to 24.6% as of 2015 (see Appendix II for further details) can be considered\nsubstantial, the main support instruments (the RO and the FiT) experienced difficulties\nafter implementation (discussed in Section 3) due to changes in the policies over time,\n2 In the 1990's, the Dutch electricity grid was run by large companies who controlled both\nproduction of energy and grid operations, which would have been ideal to implement Smart\nGrids as they require cooperation on both the electricity production and the grid side.

These\nfactors reduced power demand and revenues, while support policy costs continued to\ngrow. Politicians on the other hand did not want to face the political backlash by raising\npower prices in line with costs during a recession, resulting in an unsustainable growth of\nthe tariff deficit. The decreasing costs of e.g. solar PV also contributed to the rising\ndeficit, as the incentives instituted by the government did not reflect such trends.

While many factors surely influenced RES policies, a thorough analysis of those\nfactors is still being carried out. Therefore, a description of the following three contextual\nfactors are initial observations emerging from the research effort and serve as illustrative\nexample and not as a definitive list of issues.3\nMost interviewees suggested that the impetus of devising RES support policies came\nfrom the National Energy Policy Council, and the Energy Policy and Planning Office\n(EPPO) was tasked to study the best instrument to do so before introducing the initial FiT\npolicy in 2006. In addition, a few interviewees and literature sources mentioned that the\nimplementation of a feed-in-tariff policy (the Adder policy in 2006) took place when the\nformer director of EPPO was promoted to be the Minister of Energy at that time.

These factors are the presence of technological innovation\nsystem with an emphasis on decrease of technology costs, the market and regulatory\nframework, especially the structure of the electricity market and the presence of the EU\nregulatory framework, policy continuity, and the macro-environment with a reference to\neconomic crisis, and public perception.\nOne of the most salient messages to emerge from stakeholders was that more weight\nneeds to be given to the presence of a technological innovation system and its\n a o o  n do i  a   o \nhighlighted under this factor in a number of cases as an example of this, where the\n'h! uem leap on paddinba-! sem Ko!od pue 'paoadxaun sem abueup e uons jo Aasssod\nwhich led to inefficiencies and drastic changes to the FIT designs, particularly in Spain\nand the UK.\nAnother crucial factor was proven to be the market and regulatory framework with the\nsub-sets. Several interviewees in the UK case highlighted the insufficiency of the\nelectricity market design in dealing with increasing shares of RES, indicating that the\nmarket was set up to benefit large utilities with business models which do not fit RES\nproduction patterns, therefore limiting their interest. This is in contrast to countries like\nhas presented a significant barrier in the form of low prices of RES, limiting expansion,\nfor RES expansion. As to the EU regulatory framework, the Dutch case highlighted the\ncompanies, and the EU's limits on cooperation of commercial entities such as large and\nsmall energy suppliers, leading to viewing the framework as a blocking factor.

Based on literature survey, the overview of\ncontextual factors in CARISMA Discussion Paper No.1 (Fujiwara, Tuerk, Spyridaki and\nWilliges, 2017) identified three categories of diverse contextual factors: institutions and\ngovernance; innovation and investment; and attitudes, behaviour, and lifestyle. The new\nset of contextual factors resulting from case studies still maintains the three categories\nwith a different emphasis on individual factors.

In contrast, the factor constellation of stakeholders is\nviewed positively with a focus on political will and a ministry's commitment as an enabler\n(support for smart technologies to improve EE in Greece).\nNone of the case studies explicitly mentioned regulatory alignment with non-climate\npolicies or administrative feasibility, however the UK case alluded to this with mention of\nthat regulatory alignment is less relevant to the narrower scope of the case studies in\nsupporting measures for RE and smart technologies than the scope of examples to\ndescribe climate change mitigation policies. Administrative feasibility was highlighted in\nthe procedures of UK local authorities to permit planning wind-power development. Sub-\nnational administration was not the main focus of these case studies.\n4.2\nInnovation and investment\nAccording to the literature survey, the category of innovation and investment consists of\nfive - largely economic - factors:\n· Presence of a technological innovation system (e.g. clusters and regional\ncollaborative networks, market formation processes)\n Market and regulatory framework,\n Policy continuity (e.g. retroactive changes to RE support measures),\nMacroeconomic environment (e.g. financial crisis), and\n·\n Corporate and investment culture\nFive case studies together support all the factors, except corporate and investment\nculture. Although the literature review included an example of difference in RE\ninvestment across companies in Sweden, no case studies focused on this factor.\nPresence of a technological innovation system was recognised to affect policy adoption or\nimplementation with four possible sub-factors: absence of the technological innovation\nsystem (RE support measures in Croatia); the level of ICT development (support for\nand installation of smart technologies (support for smart technologies to improve EE in\nGreece); and in relation to market formation processes, decrease of technology costs (RE\nsupport measures in Croatia, the UK and Spain). The absence of the technological\ninnovation system and limited capacity of new market actors were viewed as barriers\nwhile a high level of ICT development as an enabler. Stakeholders found both aspects in\nthe decrease of technology costs: decreasing costs are in theory beneficial for RE\ndeployment but, depending on the incentive designs, they may make continuation of the\noriginally planned measures unsustainable. This point is further discussed with respect to\npolicy continuity.\nThe market and regulatory framework with five market sub-factors and regulatory sub-\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n19",

The\nlinear approach was seen as not flexible enough and therefore a barrier. Although RE\nsupport measures were initially welcomed in Spain, frequent changes afterwards were\nregarded as barriers, which was similar to the UK experience.\nThe effects of the macro-economic environment were also well acknowledged,\nhighlighting financial and economic crises (RE support measures in the UK and Spain;\nsupport for smart technologies in Greece) as well as fossil fuel prices (RE support\nmeasures in the Uk). Financial and economic crises were considered to be a barrier.\nVolatility of international fossil fuel prices was mentioned as a barrier. However, fossil\nfuel prices such as natural gas prices can also function as an enabler for accelerating RE\ndeployment.\nFinally, these case studies suggest that contextual factors are not isolated but may\neconomic crises forced introduction of austerity measures in some member states,\nthereby slashing budget for RE support. At the same time, faster-than-anticipated\ndecreases of technology costs, such as those of solar PV, prevented the governments\nfrom maintaining the initial level of support via Feed-In Tariffs. It is possible that both\neconomic and technological conditions caused frequent changes to the policy instrument\ndesigns.\n4.3\nAttitudes, behaviour and lifestyle\nThe third category of attitudes, behaviour and lifestyle was identified with the following\nseven sub-factors in the literature survey:\n· Collective environmental beliefs and norms,\n· Demographic attitudes and other parameters,\n· Public perception,\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n20",

For example, \"pre-existing conditions\" such as national\ninstitutions, a technological innovation system, or the macro-economic environment are\nindeed beyond and outside energy policymakers' control, as most cases showed with the\n(albeit hopefully rare) example of the financial crisis having drastic effects on both RE\nand EE policies. However, they may have some leverage against factors such as the\nmarket and regulatory framework and policy continuity (as in Croatia, where policy\ncontinuity was recognized early on as an important factor, and planned for via their non-\nstochastic approach to RE policies) by partly shaping the environment in which policies\nare implemented. Policymakers could have more direct control over reactive factors such\nas constellation of stakeholders and public perception (e.g. in the case of Greece, where\npolitical will and commitment were stressed in driving the diffusion of EE technologies),\ndetermining the specific issues and offer possible solutions to address their concerns.\n6 The authors are grateful to Henry Derwent for his helpful comments on this topic.\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n22",

A higher share of renewables in the energy\nsystem will lead to supply variability. The variability or intermittency of the supply of\nenergy occurs when supply relies on the weather, i.e. when using solar panels and wind\nturbines. As the share of renewables in total energy production grows, intermittency will\nlikely increasingly be a problem (e.g. cause blackouts). Smart Grids, the main focus of\nthis case study, are a potential solution for this problem as they are able to balance the\nenergy flows by 'downloading' energy from large-scale or distributed storage (e.g.\nelectric vehicles or house batteries) when there is shortage, and by ^uploading' it into\nbatteries when production is high, but demand is low. In the latter case energy prices\n  a is    so a   '  \nthe grid from the stress.\nTable 1.

Smart Grids indirectly contribute to reducing emissions in\ntwo ways: by enabling the balancing of intermittent renewable supply of electricity, and\nby enabling energy efficiency via offering users flexibility and proximity of energy\nconsumption ([6-8]).\nBy 2017 there is little agreement as to what components the Smart Grid should include\nand exclude, which ones are essential and which are not. The exact definition of a Smart\nGrid is open. Versions exist that feature centralised fossil fuel-based electricity\nproduction and those that feature decentralised renewable electricity generation. In the\nNetherlands the vision leans toward the latter version with electric mobility and localised\nelectricity generation [9].\n1.3.Dutch policy in support of Smart Grids\nIn public administration classification [1o] the Dutch policy on Smart Grids (SGs) used a\nmixture of Authority-based instruments (such as rules and regulations) and Treasury-\nbased instruments (such as subsidies), reflecting a 'carrot and stick' rationale.\nSpecifically, three policy instruments were relevant to the diffusion of Dutch Smart Grids.\nThe first policy instrument was the mandatory rollout of smart meters (Authority-based\nwere responsible for installation and ownership of smart meters. However, our\ninterviewees suggest that there is currently little incentive for DsOs to invest.\nIntermittency is still manageable, as problems are rare (once or twice per year) because\nthe share of renewables is relatively low in the Netherlands.\nThe rollout was funded by the end-users through network tariffs.

Initially, renewable energy capacity targets\nwere very low (under ca. 50 Mw of photovoltaic electricity), quickly sold out, and were\nestablished mainly to meet the requirements of the EU. Policy was refined over time,\nincreasing quotas for hydro, wind, geothermal, biomass and biogas production [5], with\nvarying effects.

As mentioned, the EU regulation was asserted to be\nthe main motivator for initial policymaking decisions, with an impression that generally\nnew EU regulation comes at a fast pace, creating some difficulty to keep pace. Other\nbarriers have been highlighted due not to the energy policy framework itself, but to\nconstruction, environmental, and other legal issues. Previously, transparency in regards\ninvestment, and public data is lacking.\nPrior work has shown that renewable energy strategy in Croatia has faced a number of\nobstacles, and it has frequently evolved.

Often\n   a   o  l    \namong the first countries to implement binding, long-term national emission reduction\ntargets via its flagship Climate Change Act of 2008 (CCC 2016). Since then, the UK has\n    (si ) o o  sa   s\nline with the Act's objective (DECC 2015). The reasons for this reduction are manifold,\nranging from the early move away from coal (the \"dash to gas\"; see DECC 2015), the\n o       o  \nas renewables) and energy efficiency measures. Nevertheless, a closer look reveals that\nand frictionless than the overall emission reductions seem to suggest.\nWhile the UK was able to boost its share of renewable energy in the electricity mix from\nunder 5% in 2005 to an impressive 24.6% as of 2015 (UK Government 2017), there\nhave been shortcomings in the heat and transport sector, which remain heavily fossil fuel\ndependent (House of Commons 2016). Insufficient progress in those policy areas make it\nlikely that the UK will miss its overall EU targets of 15% renewables in final energy\nconsumption, mandated by Directive 2009/28/EC (EEA 2017). In 2015, this share stood\nonly at 8.3% (UK Government 2017). And while the increase of renewable energy in\nsector, the Renewable Obligation (RO) and the Feed-in tariff (FiT), have nevertheless\nexperienced difficulties after implementation.\nThis short case study tries to shed some light on those difficulties and on what kind of\ncontextual factors may have influenced the performance of the RO and the FiT. We\nunderstand contextual factors as factors outside of the direct and immediate control of\npolicy makers, such as the macroeconomic environment, the institutional and\nbureaucratic setup of governance or societal factors such as public opinion and values.8\nBesides a review of relevant academic and grey literature, we conducted a set of semi-\nstructured interviews with seven stakeholders chosen for their expertise on the topic at\nhand. It is important to note, that this fact sheet does not strive to assess UK RES policy\ncomprehensively but to illustrate how contextual factors influence RES policy by giving\nconcreteexamples.\n8 For a more detailed explanation of our approach to contextual factors see Fujiwara et al.

Performance of the assessed Policy instrument\nThe RO is a regulatory instrument (Grimwood and Ares, 2016) to support renewable\nenergy sources (RES) in the UK and was adopted in England and Wales in 2002 with\n   s        n  \nsuppliers of electricity to source an annually increasing amount of their power sold from\nRES. Companies account for this obligation by obtaining certificates for each KWh\ngenerated from RES. Those certificates are tradable, allowing lagging firms to buy\ncertificates if their share of RES power is not high enough (Woodman and Mitchell,\n2011). Over time, the RO has undergone significant changes, with experts arguing that\nthe RO today is a very different instrument than it was in 2002 (Woodman and Mitchell,\n2011). One major amendment was the \"banding\" of technologies, which meant that\ncertificate prices were set differently for different sources, thus replacing a technology-\nneutral approach with a scheme that accorded different prices to different energy sources\nto better reflect the varying degree of technological maturity. After the banding, RES\nuptake started to grow significantly, particularly offshore wind according to two\ninterviewees. For example, onshore wind was rewarded at a different rate than offshore\nwind or solar photovoltaic (PV), since each source had and continues to have a different\ncost profile. After 2017, the RO will be phased out for new RES developers and replaced\nby a Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme to bring RES support in line with the\nobjectives of the electricity market reform (Woodman and Mitchell 2011), where a\nguaranteed price is set by auctions.\nThe introduction in 2008 of the FiT, served to foster small-scale RES uptake (up to 5\nMW), and complements the RO. With a FiT policy, RES installation owners are paid a\nfixed price on electricity generated by renewable sources. This support policy, like the\nRO, also went through changes. For example, the government introduced a digression\nrate - allowing the tariff to decrease over time to reflect decreasing installation and\n    e    -  \nintroduced a cap on the total amount of subsidies payable to RES installations in the UK,\nthus replacing a quantity-based instrument (RO) and a price-based instrument (FiT) with\n-   s o  u o oo)   e\ncarbon\" installation thus including nuclear energy as well as to installations covered\nunder the CfD scheme. . By 2020/2021, the budget under the LCF is expected to reach\naround f9 billion for all RES support policies (UK Government, 2017b), meaning that\nbeyond that amount, no support to RES is paid. While the literature points to a potential\nnegative impact on investment security due to policy interaction (Lockwood 2016),\ninterviewees argued that the LCF was successful in allowing the government to cap costs\nfor RES support. But political calculations might have played a role as well. One\ninterviewee opined that since the authority of the LCF lies with the Ministry of Finance\n(under Tory control when the LCF was enacted) and not with the Ministry of Energy (then\nWhen it comes to the evaluation of those RES support policies, we observed that\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n53",

One of the few evaluations focused on the compliance and audit aspects of the\nRO, which was assessed as \"good or satisfactory\" (Ofgem 2016). Evaluations on the\nperformance of the FiT also are few and far between. While one study found positive\nanother evaluation criticized the changes made to the policy for having a negative impact\non the “commercial environment\" of particularly solar PV (The Energy and Climate\nChange and Environmental Audit Committees 2011).\n3.\nSelected contextual factors and their relevance for\npolicy design and implementation\nOverall, most of the stakeholders assessed both the RO and the FiT as being effective\npolicies in boosting the share of renewable energy in the UK. However, in terms of a\nmore qualitative analysis, stakeholders pointed out flaws in the design of both policies,\nparticularly during the first phases of the RO and the FiT. The factors cited most as\neconomic efficiency, rising costs for consumers or the regressive effects on wealth\ndistribution, particularly for the FiT. However, one academic stakeholder deplored the\n\"obsession\" with economics and costs in UK, where questions of economic efficiency and\n   ba o  )  o   n so\naccording to the interviewee, hinder UK policy makers' capacity to tackle issues\nstakeholder who stated the importance, even the dogma, of the liberal market for UK\npolicy makers. When asked about which factors outside of the direct control of policy\nmakers had influenced the outcome of both the RO and the FiT policy, many answers\nrelated to the list of contextual factors provided by Fujiwara et al. (2017). Table 1\nsummarizes responses and offers a description of the effects in the UK case. Given the\nbroad scope of the initial list of contextual factors provided by Fujiwara et al.

Several conclusions can be drawn from this\nshort case study.\n o s t  s ons  e o s  e s\nthe most salient unanticipated contextual factors which influenced UK RES policy has\nwidened the gap between what producers have to spend (to generate electricity,\ndecreasing) and what remuneration they receive (stable). This contributed to the rising\nelectricity bill for household since all consumers pay for the FiT via a levy. Therefore,\ntechnological developments in order to keep costs for consumers acceptable. Auctioning\nhas been put forward by some interviewees (and indeed the European Commission; see\nEuropean Commission 2013) as a more flexible instrument but auctions are not free from\ncriticism either (see Kitzing et al. 2016).\nHowever, and pertaining to the first point, flexibility should not be confused with frequent\nand sudden policy changes that are not conducive to effective RES support policy. While\nchanges sometimes have beneficial effects (such as the banding of technologies in the\nRO's second phase), retroactive or retrospective changes as well as drastic changes\nshould be avoided (Lockwood 2016) and policy continuity for both consumers and\ninvestors should be maintained.\nThird, contextual factors such as public opinion play a strong role when policies are\ndesigned or revised. This is particularly the case in the UK, where public opinion is often\nswayed by a rightwing media which favours the status quo of a centralised, fossil fuel\nbased energy system. Moreover, political calculations concerning the NIMBY attitude of\nrural, conservative voters has led the government to favour (more expensive) offshore\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n56",

While all\nacross Europe, markets are being redesigned to cater to technological and economic\nchanges, societal aspects of a successful energy transition are often lagging behind in\nembracing new realities. One key factors for a successful energy transition is the direct\nimplication of citizens. In Germany, almost 50% of RES installations are owned by\nfor the energy transitions' success (see BoBner 2016). Putting the citizens in the energy\ntransition's driver's seat has not happened to that extend in the UK where knowledge\nabout and interest in renewable energies is still low according to two interviewees.\nDelivering on national as well as international climate targets and bringing about a low-\ncarbon economy necessitates a comprehensive approach which includes citizens as\nstewards of the energy transition instead of leaving them standing by the road.\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n57",

Introduction\nSpain has been at the forefront of the expansion of the renewable energy sources in the\nelectricity sector, spurred by state support through feed-in tariffs and feed-in premiums.\nFrom 2010 to 2014 subsequent reforms have all but stopped the renewable sector\nexpansion, and the once generous support turned into a de facto tax. Some more policy\napproaches are now being introduced to address imbalances created by the RES policies.\nThis paper analyses the causes of policy decisions, and presents some recommendations,\nthe text is based on interviews and background research from documents provided by\nthe stakeholders? or collected by the authors.\nRecent statistics show the impressive share of renewables in the energy mix.

Over\nthe same period of the preceding year RES generation reached 54,1% (wind 21,9%;\nsolar PV 3,3%; solar thermal 1,9%, hydro 25,9%, other 1,1%). This is despite the fact\nthat for this period in 2017 electricity demand was 5,5% lower. This means that\nproduction from renewable sources in 2016 was even higher than the proportion would\nimply. The strong rise in hydro also leads to the conclusion that solar and wind supply fell\nin absolute terms.\nFigure 1.

The tariff deficit is the result of a shortage of \nrevenues by consumers compared with the costs of the system, costs include transport\nand distribution network and regulated costs and subsidies, including the support to\nrenewable energy.

Introduction\nThe building sector in Greece consists of the residential and tertiary sector and consumes\n37% of the final energy (CRES and ODYSSEE-MURE II, 2015). Buildings in Greece are\nclassified as low-efficient among the EU Member States due to their age, deficiencies in\ntheir environmental design and the lack of thermal insulation in almost 7o% of the\nexisting stock (Papada and Kaliampakos, 2016; Spyridaki et al., 2016). Promoting\nenergy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy sources (RES) technologies is essential for\nachieving energy savings and GHG emissions reduction in the Greek building sector. At\nthe same time, these actions have been considered imperative to meet the EU energy\nand climate targets for 2020. The 20-20-20 EU targets and relevant Directives have\n    e aa a a  a   b a\ncomply with the relevant European policy and objectives. As a result, a number of\nmeasures fostering energy efficiency interventions and REs installations have already\nbeen introduced (Spyridaki et al., 2014).\nIn transposition of the EED 2012/27/EU, the Greek government has proposed a set of\npolicy measures consisting both from the continuation of the existing policy mix, as well\nas of new ones to fulfil its national requirements (MEECC, 2014). Reportedly, existing\ninstruments such as subsidy programs, have demonstrated restrained participation levels\ns            o\nsuch as voluntary agreements and tax exemptions have remained on idle (Spyridaki et\nal., 2016). During the post-crisis period, subsidies for EE programmes in the household\nsector in Greece are focused on the continuation of the \"Energy Savings at Home\"\nprogramme. Due to significant restrains in the public budget, support efforts in terms of\ngradually from the private sector and energy utilities.\nIn view of the eminent recast of the EED and of the EPBD, increased attention is also\nplaced on the smart performance of the Greek building sector. Regarding the latter,\nGreece is still considered a slow starter when it comes to smart-readiness of buildings\n(BPIE, 20i7). In the following paragraphs, existing policies as well as future ones,\nreported by representatives from the ministry and the energy agency as the key policy\ninstruments for promoting energy efficiency in the Greek residential building sector, are\noutlined with respect to their role for promoting smart technologies. Future schemes\nrequired to promote building innovation technologies were also highlighted by relevant\nstakeholders and thus are also discussed.\n1.1.

Policy Background\n1.2.1.Regulation on the Energy Performance of Buildings (REPB)\nIn Greece, the EPBD was issued in 2002, but was not transposed into Greek law until\nmuch later. The Greek REPB, commonly referred in Greek as \"KENAK\" was enacted by\n2002/91/EC by the EU court of Justice, in January 2008 (Dascalaki et al., 2012; Maria,\nLimniou, and Kokkaliaris, 2013). Greece is currently on route to implement measures\ntowards nearly zero-energy buildings by 2020 through the transposition of the EPBD\n2009/28/EC). According to representatives from the Greek Ministry, the current planning\nand recast of the Greek REPB envisages among others: (i) the identification of the cost-\noptimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings, (ii) the\n      n  a   \nDevelopments have already been routed for the first action, while are still in progress for\nthe next two. Furthermore, according to representatives from the ministry, the revision\nof the Directive 2010/31/EE envisages:\nthe ability to control better their energy consumption, promoting at the same time a\nmore decentralized residential system,\nThe deployment of smart solutions (i.e. intelligent control devices) in HVAC systems.\nThe promotion of the \"e-mobility\" concept, through the installation of charging points for\nelectrical vehicles,\nThe introduction of smart buildings through the incorporation of the smart-readiness\nindicator. Thus, the new Energy Performance Certificates will evaluate not only the\nsmart-readiness of each residence under inspection, but they will, also, assess the ability\nof the building to be \"smart\" and interact with the user and the grid.\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n70",

More specifically, the programme provided\nfor the replacement of doors/windows (frames/glazing), the installation of heat insulation\nand the upgrading of the heating and hot water supply systems. The programme started\non 1st February of 2011. It was implemented through a revolving Fund entitled\n\"Exoikonomo kat'oikon Fund\", which was the first Holding Fund established in Greece and\nwas implemented through banks, which co-financed 2/3 of the loan. The implementation\nperiod was until 2015 (MEECC, 2012; CRES and ODYSSEE-MURE II, 2015; Spyridaki et\nal., 2016). The only smart activity that was foreseen through the programme was the\ninstallation of automatic control devices for the operation of heating systems, such as\nBuildings\" has already been initiated. Its implementation period will extend to years from\nmore than 200.000 dwellings (MEECC, 2014). Stakeholders and experts reported that\nwithin the framework of the scheme's revision more smart technologies are envisaged to\nbe included as eligible actions/interventions under the scheme.\n1.2.3.Smart Meters Rollout\nGreece is considered an \"ambiguous mover\" regarding smart meters deployment.\nAlthough a legal and/or regulatory framework has been already established to some\nof legislative clarity (USmartConsumer, 2016). Regulatory efforts continue with the\ncurrent legislative status, for the case of Greece, being mandatory between 2014 and\n2020 (Zhou and Brown, 2016). The responsibility of the smart meter roll-out\nspecifications, budget, schedule and cost allocation was assigned, in 2011, to the\nRegulatory Authority for Energy (RAE), with the goal to reach the target of Smart-Meters'\nrollout at 80% minimum by 2020. In February 2013, the large-scale replacement of\nconventional meters with smart metering systems was approved by Ministerial Decision.\nHEDNO undertook this responsibility, with the obligation to start no later than July 2014\nand the aim of replacing 40% of the existing meters by July 2017 and at least 80% of\nthem by the end of 2020. The adoption of this Ministerial Decision also constituted an\nobligation of Greece according to the Memorandum (Greece, 2012). The smart meter roll\nout is expected to foster the development of the market through the promotion of new\nproducts and services by companies active in the energy sector, while achieving\n  sn  ss  i l  's   a i\npromoting actions to change energy behaviour, as well as promoting innovative solutions\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n71",

A significant\nboost to such technologies is expected due to the imposition of abatement targets in the\nannual sales volume of retail energy companies. Annual targets are introduced through\nthe obligation scheme which is considered instrumental by Greek policy makers in\nmainstreaming such technologies in the domestic energy market by addressing\npersistent market failures (e.g. lack of appropriate incentives). Reportedly the operation\nof the obligation scheme is expected to gradually transform the Greek energy efficiency\nmarket enhancing the availability of smart and efficient technologies, relevant know-how,\nexpertise and innovativeness as well as smart and sustainable ways of financing.\nOverall, the EEO scheme is envisaged to play a pivotal role in the diffusion of smart\ntechnologies for energy efficiency and eventually the development of an energy efficient\nmarket in Greece.\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n72",

In 2015, 84% of its final energy consumption\n  s   o   s o  \nsupply is set to decrease and the country is a net importer of primary energy (IEA 2016),\nAssembly and Ministry of Energy 2009; Ministry of Energy 2008; Energy Policy and\nPlanning Office 2016; Ministry of Energy 2015). Consequently, the development of\ndomestic renewable energy sources (REs) has become one of the strategies to address\nboth the increasing energy demand and energy security issues (Ministry of Energy 2015).\nbecame the first country in Southeast Asia to implement a feed-in tariff policy (Tongsopit\nand Greacen 2013; IEA 2016). The program was called \"Adder\" because it added an\nadditional \"top-up\" to RE generators on the normal wholesale price that power producers\nwould receive when selling electricity to utilities (IEA 2007; Tongsopit and Greacen 2013;\nthe Adder programme with a fixed feed-in tariff program (FiT). The new program grants\ndifferent fixed FiT rates while contract lengths depending on the type of technology. In\n  )         \ninterviewees as well as scholars see Thailand's feed-in tariff policy as a success story\nwhich  facilitated  an  impressive amount of  investment  in  renewable energy\n(Sakulniyomporn et al. 2016; Tongsopit and Greacen 2013; Beerepoot et al. 2013). As a\nresult, between 2007 and the end of 2016, the share of renewables in the Thai electricity\nmix increased from 1.7% to 6.2% (EPPO 2017).\nstraightforward process. While many factors surely have influenced RES policies, analysis\nof those factors is still being carried out. Therefore, a description of the following\ncontextual factors are initial observations emerging from our research effort and serve as\nillustrative example and not as a definitive list of issues.\n2.Institutional Framework\nThailand has a vertical institutional framework which facilitates a top-down policy making\napproach. At the top of the institutional framework is the National Energy Policy Council\n i a  n   o io   ()\nNEPC is a ministers-like council chaired by the Prime Minister (IEA 2016). Further down\nthe chain of command, the Ministry of Energy (MoEN), the Energy Policy and Planning\nOffice (EPPO) and the Energy Regulatory Office (ERC) are the main institutions of the\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n80",

This vertical structure\nmeans that the Prime Minister and the MoEN are the most influential stakeholders when\nit comes to national energy policy and usually make the final decision (Sitdhiwei 2016;\nstakeholder interview); EPPO, as the Permanent Secretariat to the NEPC, assumes the\nroles of proposing, formulating and administrating the energy policy (Wisuttisak 2010;\nEPPO 2016).\nSome interviewees (from the Energy Policy and Planning Office and Energy Regulatory\nCommission) suggested that the impetus of devising RES support policies came from the\nNEPC, and that EPPO was then tasked to study the best instrument to do so. After\ncarrying out studies and external consultations on various instruments, EPPO proposed\nthe Adder program as the best instrument given the national context and political\nlandscape. In addition, a few interviewees (from government and research organizations)\nand literature sources mentioned that the implementation of the Adder policy took place\nwhen the former director of EPPO was promoted to be the minister of energy ministry at\nthat time.\nWith regards to the Thai renewable energies support, two observations concerning\ncontextual factors can be made: First, while the top-down structure of the institutional\nframework does not necessarily mean that a given policy is effective, it can be assumed\nthat a policy instrument which is in line with governmental priorities and is endorsed at\nthe highest governmental level has better chances of being a success than a policy\nenvironment suggests, that the motivation and vision of individual decision and/or policy\nmakers might play a significant role in Thai energy policy.\n3.

This view has been corroborated by the literature which finds that the\nhindering new competitors to access to the market (Sitdhiwei 2016; Wattana et al. 2008;\nWisuttisak 2010). Subsequently, this sub-optimal set up of the market reduces the\nefficiency of the feed-in tariff policy to increase renewable energy shares in the electricity\nsector.\nAdministrative feasibility\nThe Adder program has experienced significant changes since its inception. Tariff rates\nhave been altered multiple times as have screening criteria for the selection of RES\napplications (Tongsopit and Greacen 2013). In the beginning, simple rules and a\ns           \nmodules led to a great number of applications, particularly for solar PV. At first, this\n'solar gold rush' was not seen as a problem until a very lucrative market of reselling\nhand, the exponential increase of applications could potentially engender a sharp\nincrease in electricity prices (since more Mw installed meant more expenditure in RES\nsupport tariffs). On the other hand, the ministry was not sure whether all of the sold and\nresold permits would actually lead to the building of RES capacity instead of being used\nto speculate on increasing permit prices (Tongsopit and Greacen 2013). Quite generally,\nthis speaks to the fact that particularly the solar PV market is still in the hands of\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n82",

The committee adopted new and more stringent\nrules for application and cancelled some old, idle contracts without a clear guideline on\nfuture project approvals. The Committee further complicated the application process\nand monitoring mechanisms were limited, which caused confusion and doubts about the\nprogram's transparency and the security of business interests (Tongsopit and Greacen\n  sa       a so  g\nrenewable energy sector (Beerepoot et al. 2013).\nIt is clear that frequent and ad-hoc changes to support instrument as well as to their\nadministrative and procedural rules and regulations had a detrimental effect on\nn  u n a o  su se u u n a a\n(Tongsopit and Greacen 20i3) but has also been mentioned during several stakeholder\ninterviews.\nOur short case study of Thai renewable energy support instruments demonstrates that\ncontextual factors do influence the policy making processes at many different stages.\nImplementing a  new policy  requires a  well-coordinated institutional  structure.  In\nsupport is essential for successful renewables development. Furthermore, market\nstructures can either facilitate or hinder the entry of new market players and enable or\nlimit investment in RES. In the Thai case, the quasi monopoly of the state-owned utilities\nis certainly a hindering factor. Lastly, administrative feasibility has direct effects on policy\noutcomes. Though adjustments might benefit the performance of policies and are indeed\nnecessary sometimes, frequent and drastic retroactive changes in the end negatively\naffect the trust and confidence of investors.\n27 According to an interviewee.\nKnowledge gaps about key contextual factors\n83",
