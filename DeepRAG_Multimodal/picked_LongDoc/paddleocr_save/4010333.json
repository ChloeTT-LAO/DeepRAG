IDS STANDARDS\na. IDS Purpose. An IDS shall detect an unauthorized penetration into the secured area. An\nIDS shall be installed when results of a documented risk assessment determmine its use as a\nsupplemental control is warranted, in accordance with Enclosure 3, sections 3 and 4 of this\nVolume, and use is approved by the activity head. When used, all areas that reasonably afford\naccess to the security container or areas where classified data is stored shall be protected by IDS\nunless continually occupied. An IDS complements other physical security measures and consists\nof:\n(1)Intrusion detection equipment (IDE)\n(2) Security forces.\n(3)  Operating procedures.\nb. System Functions\n(1)IDS components operate as a system with four distinct phases:\n(a) Detection.\n(b) Communications.\n(c)Assessment.\n(d)  Response.\n(2) These elements are equally important, and none can be eliminated if an IDS is to\nprovide an acceptable degree of protection.\n(a)  Detection.  During the detection phase, a detector or sensor senses and reacts to\nthe stimuli it is designed to detect. The sensor alam condition is then transmitted over cabling\nlocated within the protected area to the premise control unit (PCU). The PCU may service many\nsensors. The PCU and the sensors it serves comprise a zone at the monitor station (i.e., an\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n46\nAPPENDIXTOENCLOSURE3",
    "Page_47": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\nalamed zone).\n(b)  Communications.  The PCU receives signals from all sensors in a protected area\nand incorporates these signals into a communication scheme. An additional signal is added to\nthe communication for supervision to prevent compromise of the communication scheme (i.e.\nPCU through the transmission link to the monitor station. Inside the monitor station either a\ndedicated panel or central processor monitors infommation from the PCU signals. When an alam\nOccurs, an annunciator generates an audible and visible alert to security personnel. Alams result\nnommally from intrusion, tampening, component failure, or system power failure.\n(c) Assessment. The assessment peniod is the first phase that requires human\nresponse force.\n(d)Response. The response phase begins as soon as the operator assesses an alarm\ncondition. A response force shall immediately respond to all alamms. The response phase shall\nalso determine the precise nature of the alam and take all measures necessary to safeguard the\nsecure area.\nc. Acceptability of Equipment: All IDE must be Underwniters Laboratories (UL)-listed (or\nequivalent) and approved by the DoD Component. Govemment installed, maintained, or\nfumished systems are acceptable.\nd.  Transmission and Annunciation\n(1) Transmission Line Security. When the transmission line leaves the facility and\ntraverses an uncontrolled area, Class I or Class II line supervision shall be used.\n(a)  Class I.  Class I security is achieved through the use of Data Encryption Standard\nor an algorithm based on the cipher feedback or cipher block chaining mode of encryption.\nCertification by the National Institutes of Standards and T'echnology or another independent\ntesting laboratory is required.\n(b)  Class I. Class II line supervision refers to systems in which the transmission is\nbased on pseudo-random generated tones or digital encoding using an intermogation and response\nscheme throughout the entire communication, or UL Class AA line supervision The signal shall\nnot repeat itself within a minimum 6-month peniod  Class II secunity shall be impervious to\ncompromise using resistance, voltage, current, or signal substitution techniques.\n(2) Intemal Cabling.  The cabling between the sensors and the PCU shall be dedicated to\nIDE and shall comply with national and local code standards.\n(3)  Entry and/or Access Control Systems. If an entry and/or access control system is\nintegrated into an IDS, reports from the automated entry and/or access control system shall be\nsubordinate in pnonty to reports from intrusion alams.\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n47\nAPPENDIXTOENCLOSURE 3",

Protection of classified infomation is essential to maintaining security\nand achieving mission success in DoD operational and warfighting environments. Prompt\nreporting of security incidents ensure that such incidents are properly investigated and the\nnecessary actions are taken to negate or minimize the adverse effects of an actual loss or\nunauthorized disclosure of classified infommation and to preclude recurrence through an\ninfomed, properly tailored, and up-to-date security education and awareness program. In cases\nwhere compromise has been ruled out and there is no adverse effect on national security, a\ncommon sense approach to the early resolution of an incident at the lowest appropriate level is\nencouraged.  All security incidents involving classified infomation shall involve a secunity\ninquiry, a secunty investigation, or both\n a. The terms associated with security incidents are fommally defined in the Glossary, but to\nensure common understanding, the following general characterizations are provided:\n(1)  Infraction  An infraction is a secunity incident involving failure to comply with\nsecurity policy) which cannot reasonably be expected to, and does not, result in the loss,\nsuspected compromise, or compromise of classified infomation. An infraction may be\nunintentional or inadvertent. While it does not constitute a security violation, if left uncomected,\ncan lead to security violations or compromises. It requires an inquiry to facilitate immediate\ncorrective action but does not require an in-depth investigation.\n(2)Violation. Violations are secunity incidents that indicate knowing, willful, and\nnegligent for security regulations, and result in, or could be expected to result in, the loss or\ncompromise of classified infomation. Security violations require an inquiry and/or\ninvestigation.\n(a)  Compromise. A compromise is a security incident (more specifically, a\nviolation) in which there is an unauthorized disclosure of classified infomation (i.e., disclosure\nto a person(s) who does not have a valid clearance, authorized access, or a need to know).\n(b) Loss.  A loss occurs when classified infomation cannot be physically located or\ncannot be immediately located).\n(3)  Inquiry.  An inquiry is fact-finding and analysis conducted to determine whether or\nnot there was a loss of classified infommation or whether or not unauthorized personnel had, or\ncould have had, access to the infomation. The inquiry identifies the facts, characterizes the\nincident as an infraction or a violation, identifies if possible the cause(s) and person(s)\nresponsible, reports comective actions taken or to be taken, and makes recommendations as to the\nneed for further comective action or a more in-depth investigation. Inquires, generally, are\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n86\nENCLOSURE 6",
    "Page_87": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\ninitiated and conducted at the lowest echelon possible within the DoD Component.\n(4) Investigation  An investigation is conducted for a security violation when the\nincident cannot be resolved via inquiry or for incidents where an in- depth and comprehensive\nexamination of the matter is appropriate.\nb. Certain practices dangerous to security, while not reportable as security incidents, have\nthe potential to jeoparrlize the security of classified infomation and material if allowed to\nperpetuate. Examples of such practices are: placing a paper recycling box next to a classified\nestablishment to conduct personal business while hand-carying classified infomation; or failing\nto change security container combinations promptly when required. These practices, when\nidentified, must be promptly addressed by security management and appropriate changes made,\nactions taken, or training provided, to ensure the security of classified information.\n2. CONSEQUENCES OF COMPROMISE. The compromise of classified infommation presents\na threat to the national secunity and may damage intelligence or operational capabilities; lessen\nthe DoD ability to protect critical infommation, technologies, and programs; or reduce the\neffectiveness of DoD management. Once a compromise is known to have occurred, the\nseriousness of damage to U.S. national security or the extent of the adverse affect on the national\nsecurity must be determmined and appropriate measures taken to negate or minimize the adverse\neffects. When possible, action shall also be taken to regain custody of documents or material\nidentify the source and reason for the suspected or actual compromise and take remedial action\nto prevent recumence.\n3. REPORTING AND NOTIFICATIONS\na. Anyone finding classified infommation out of proper control shall, if possible, take custody\nof and safeguard the material and immediately notify the appropriate security authorities. Secure\ncommunications should be used for notification whenever possible.\nb. Every civilian employee and Active, Reserve, and National Guard Military member of the\nDepartment of Defense, and every DoD contractor or employee of a contractor working with\nclassified material, as provided by the terms of the contract, who becomes aware of the loss or\npotential compromise of classified infommation shall immediately report it to the head of his or\nc. If the person believes that the head of the activity or the security manager may have been\ninvolved in or responsible for the incident, he or she may report it to the security authorities at\nthe next higher level of command or supervision.  If circumstances of discovery make such\nnotification impractical, the indivicdual shall notify the commanding officer or security manager\ncounterintelligence (CI), or Defense criminal investigative organization (DCIO).\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n87\nENCLOSURE 6",

(In rare cases, it might also be discovered that the\ninfomation has gained sensitivity and should be upgraded.)\n(2) The infomation has been so compromised by the incident that attempting to protect\nit further as classified is unrealistic or inadvisable, and it should be declassified.\n(3) The infomation should continue to be classified at its current level.\nc.

A damage assessment is undertaken to determine the effect of a compromise on the\n national security.\nexamination of the facts sumounding the compromise to determine the practical effects of a\ncompromise on DoD programs, operations, systems, materials, and intelligence and on the\nDepartment of Defense's ability to conduct its missions; to address mitigations and\ncountermmeasures that could be put in place to decrease or offset the impact; to determmine the\nestimated dollar costs to implement countermeasures essential to maintain or reinstate security,\nor to replace weapons systems or capabilities that are thoroughly compromised; and to provide,\nwhen appropriate, specific recommendations for action.\n(2) A damage assessment is conducted after the classification review and often follows\nany prosecutorial actions. However, when necessary to identify damage done by the dlisclosure\nor otherwise appropriate, a damage assessment may be conducted pre- prosecution.\n(3)  The damage assessment is not to be confused either with the classification review\nimmediately upon the discovery of disclosure or compromise to minimize risk, limit damage,\nand/or prevent further loss or compromise.\nb. Each DoD Component shall establish a system of controls and intemal procedures to\nensure that damage assessments are conducted, at a minimum, for cases of compromise\ninvolving espionage, intelligence infomation or compromise via the public media.

Security officials should provide assistance as needed and appropriate.\n(2) The results of relevant security inquiries and investigations shall be made available to\ninfom the damage assessment process, as needed. Reports of criminal or CI investigations\nassociated with the compromise should be requested by the OCA from the cognizant DCIO or\nDefense Cl component.\n11. VERIFICATION, REEVALUATION, AND DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TIMELINES. The\nverification and reevaluation steps in section 9 of this enclosure, and when appropriate the\ndamage assessment process in section 10 of this enclosure, shall be completed as soon as\npossible following notification of a compromise. However, damage assessments requiring multi-\ndisciplinary or multiple agency review of the adverse effects of the compromise on systems,\noperations, and/or intelligence, may sometimes be a long- tem process. The DoD goal for\ncompletion of a damage assessment involving compromised classified infomation is no longer\nthan 6 months from the first date the compromise was declared. Accomplishment of the\nassessment prior to the initiation of legal or administrative proceedings may be beneficial; check\nwith legal counsel.\n12.ACTUALORPOTENTIALCOMPROMISESINVOLVINGMORE THANONE\nAGENCY. When classified infomation under the control of more than one DoD Component or\nanother Federal agency is involved, the affected activities are responsible for coordinating their\nefforts in evaluating the classification of infomation involved and assessing damage.\n13. DEBRIEFING IN CASES OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. In cases where unauthorized\naccess to classified informmation has occumed, it may be advisable to discuss the situation with the\nindividual(s) to enhance the probability that he or she shall properly protect it. The activity head\nshall determine if a debriefing is warranted. This decision shall be based on the circumstances of\nthe incident, what is known about the person(s) involved, and the nature of the infomation The\nfollowing general guidelines apply:\na. If the unauthorized access was by a person with the appropriate security clearance but no\nneed to know, debriefing is usually appropriate only so far as necessary to ensure that the\nindividual is aware that the infommation to which they had unauthorized access is classified and\nrequires protection.\nb. If the unauthorized access was by U.S. Govemment civilian or military personnel or an\nemployee of a U.S. Govemment contractor, who does not have a security clearance, debriefing is\ndissemination of the infomation and of the administrative sanctions and criminal penalties that\nmight follow if he or she fails to do so. The debriefing shall be designed to ensure that the\nindividual understands the nature of the infomation, why its protection is important, and knows\nwhat to do if someone tries to obtain the infommation. In the case of non- DoD U.S. Govemment\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n99\nENCLOSURE 6",
    "Page_100": "DoDM5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\nindividual' s parent organization, including the appropriate facility security officer where\napplicable, shall be advised of the debriefing.\nc. If the person involved is neither a member of a U.S. Govemment organization nor an\nemployee of a U.S. Govemment contractor, the decision is much more situational. The key\nquestion is whether the debriefing shall have a positive effect on the person' s ability or\nwillingness to protect the infommation.\nd.  In any case where the person to be debriefed may be the subject of criminal prosecution or\ne. It is sometimes useful to have the person being debriefed sign a statement acknowledging\nthe debriefing and his or her understanding of its contents, or to execute a SF 312. If an NDA is\nnot executed, the nature and fommat of the statement is left to the dliscretion of the local security\nofficial to allow flexibility in meeting the requirements of a particular incident. If the person\nrefuses to sign an NDA or debriefing statement when asked, this fact and his or her stated\nreasons for refusing shall be made a matter of recordl in the inquiry.\n14. REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS. The DoD Components shall establish\nnecessary reporting and oversight mechanisms to ensure that inquiries and/or investigations are\nconducted when required, that they are done in a timely and efficient manner, and that\nappropriate management action is taken to correct identified problems. Inquiries or\nshortcomings that may have caused or contributed to the incident. The effectiveness of activity\nsecurity procedures, security education, supervisory oversight of security practices, etc., shall be\n Considered in determining causes and contributing factors. The focus of management response\nto secunity incidents shall be to eliminate or minimize the probability of further incidents\noccuming. Appropriate disciplinary action or legal prosecution, as discussed in section 17,\nEnclosure 3 of Volume 1 of this Manual, is sometimes one means of doing this, but the broader\nfocus on prevention shall not be lost. Simple disciplinary action, without consideration of what\nother factors may have contributed to the situation, shall not be considered an acceptable\nresponse to a security incident.\nAppendixes\n 1.

The continuing protection and\n2. RESPONSIBILITY. In aCcordance with Reference (b), Overall security responsibility for\nprotection of classified infommation and CUI remains with the infomation security program and\nstaff, even though the data and/or informmation resides on IT and infommation systems and\nnetworks managed and controlled by the DoD Component Chief Informmation Officer\nAccordingly, proactive and continuous engagement and collaboration between security, IT, and\n IA professionals, at all organizational levels, is essential in order to ensure the protection of DoD\ninfommation as well as the Department' s electronic enterprise.\n3. IA ROLES AND FUNCTIONS\na. In accordance with Reference (v) and DoDD 8oo0.O1 (Reference (bq)), IA and IT policy\n and infomation systems operations are the purview of the Chief Infomation Officer of the\nDepartment of Defense at the OSD level and the counterpart organizations in the DoD\nComponents.\nb. U.S. Strategic Command, through U.S. Cyber Command (USCY BERCOM), has the\noverall responsibility for directing the operation of and assuring the security of the global DoD\nnetwork environment. USCY BERCOM will lead the day-to-day defense and protection of the\nDoD networks and will coordinate all DoD network operations, providing full spectrum support\n to military and counterterorism missions.\n C. At the DoD Component and activity level, there are several important IA roles and\nfunctions that security managers need to recognize and understand to develop a productive\nofficer (IAO). The Glossary provides definitions of these functions and identifies other titles that\nare sometimes used for these same functions.\n4. IA CONCEPTS\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n104\nENCLOSURE 7",

All DoD infomation systems are to maintain appropriate levels of\navailability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation in order to protect and\ndefend DoD infommation and networks. While all five of these attributes are critical to the user' s\nability to perfom the assigned mission, from an infommation security perspective, confidentiality\nand authentication may be the most important.\n(1)The loss of availability means that the infomation system, computer network, and/or\ndata are unavailable to authorized users, and missions or operations cannot be perfomed.

System Categorization. Each infomation system must be categonized and have\nappropriate IA controls assigned in accordance with Reference (v). System categorization\nrequires determination of the potential impacts of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability associated with the specific system or infommation.  IA controls are selected based on\nthe results of the system categorization process. Security personnel may find it helpful to\nunderstand the categorization of the DoD infomation system(s) within their area of\nresponsibility, as those designations impact the infommation, physical, personal, and operational\nsecurity environment and the resource requirements that must be dedicated to protection of the\nsystem(s) and the infomation processed.\nReference (s).\n(1)  Certification is the comprehensive evaluation of the technical and nontechnical (e.g.,\nprocess.

DATA SPILLS\n a. Classified data spills occur when classified data is introduced either onto an unclassified\ninfomation system or to an infomation system with a lower level of classification, or to a\nsystem not accredlited to process data of that restrictive category. Although it is possible that no\nunauthorized disclosure occumed, classified data spills are considered and handled as a possible\ncompromise of classified infomation involving infomation systems, networks, and computer\nequipment until the inquiry detemines whether an unauthorized disclosure dlid or did not occur.\nb. When a classified data spill occurs, the activity security manager is responsible ensuring\nthat the policy requirements for adcressing an unauthorized disclosure, as specified in Enclosure\n6 or other provisions of this Manual, are met (e.g., inquiry, notification, investigation, damage\nassessment); however, these responsibilities must be camied out in close coordination with the IT\nand/or IA staff, which has overall responsibility for the operation of the networks and systems as\nwell as the technical knowledge needed to address the spill. Security personnel have the overall\nlead for addressing such events\nc. CNSS Policy 18 (Reference (br) applies to the spillage of classified national security\ninfomation on any infommation system, be it govemment, contractor, or privately owned, and\nGovermment organization that owns or operates classified infomation systems is required to\nestablish policies and procedures for handlling classified infomation spillage. When a classified\ndata spill occurs, Reference (br) requires that it is immediately:\n(1)  Reported to the appropriate authorities, including, at a minimum, the OCA, the\ninfomation owner/originator, the IAM, the activity security manager, and the responsible\ncomputer incident response center.\n(2)  Isolated and contained to minimize damage and to preserve evidence that may be\nrequired for damage assessment, risk assessment, law enforcement, or CI purposes. All affected\nmedia is to be considered classified at the same level as the spilled infomation until the\nappropriate remediation processes have been executed and verified.\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n106\nENCLOSURE 7",

If so, remediation procedures, which must be\ndeveloped, approved, and tested in advance, should be implemented\n(2) E-mail (whether in the body of the e-mail or attachment) is the most common method\nby which spills occur. The IA staff should have proven procedures to remedliate up to Secret-\npersonal electronic devices (PED), however, may entail destruction of the hardware.\n(3) For Secret-level spills and below, the technical state of the art cumently allows for\nOverwriting and sanitization of contaminated media, and reentry of the media into service. There\nis no approved overwriting or sanitization procedure for media that has been contaminated with\nTop Secret, SAP, or SCI data, short of physical destruction. However, such media may continue\n(4) Eary identification of classified spills, and a thorough understanding of where the\nspilled data was sent, is essential to avoid widespread contamination (or re- contamination) of\nback-up servers, tape systems, and off-site storage locations, most of which are configured to run\nnightly or during periods of low usage.\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n107\nENCLOSURE 7",

DISPOSAL OF COMPUTER MEDIA\na. NSA/CSS publishes lists of products that meet specific perfomance criteria for sanitizing.\ndestroying or disposing of various types of media containing sensitive or classified infomation.\nAmong the products identified are those that can be used for erasure of magnetic storage devices\n(e.g., hard drives) and destruction of optical media (e.g., CDs and DVDs).

The NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual, available at that web\naddress, addresses proceclures required for sanitization, declassification and release of computer\nstorage devices that have held classified infommation.  Overwriting as a method of clearing\npreviously classified data may be used when the media is reused within the same environment\nSections 17 and 18 of Enclosure 3 of this Volume provide additional guidance on destruction of\nclassified infomation.\n b. When no longer needed, UNCLASSIFIED computer systems and hard drives may be\ndisposed of outside the Department of Defense. In some circumstances, the equipment may be\nprovided to non- govemment entities for reutilization. To ensure that no data or infommation\nremains on operable unclassified hard dhrives that are transferred or permanently removed from\n DoD custody, the drives must be sanitized by overwriting. Where overwriting is inappropriate or\nservice (i.e., thrown away), the drives must be destroyed. The specific methods and procedures\ndiffer depending on sensitivity of data and ownership of the hard drive. To ensure DoD\ninfommation is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals, the activity security\nmanager should coordinate with the local DAA and/or IT staff to ensure local procedures for\ndisposal of computer hard drives appropriately adcdress removal of U.S. Govemment data prior to\ndisposal. (See Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and\nIntelligence Memorandum (Reference (bt) for detailed guidance.)\n7. NON-TRADITIONAL WORK ENVIRONMENTS. Increasingly, a wide variety of sensitive\nand even classified activities are perfommed from non- traditional work environments, to include\nemployee homes. In the historic context, this work has principally involved unclassified\ninfomation and projects. However, classified IT (e.g., SIPRNET) systems and installations are\nincreasingly being approved for utilization by senior personnel. When such is the case, in\naddition to the requirements of section 12 of Enclosure 2 of this Volume, the following minimum\nphysical and administrative security criteria must be addressed:\nfrom local authorities to facilitate understanding of risks associated with the site.\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n108\nENCLOSURE 7",

See Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Infomation Integration\n(ASD(NII)) Memorandum (Reference (bu)) for detailed guidance.\n9. PII\na.  PII, which is a type of CUI, must be protected from public disclosure in accordance with\nFederal policy, as described in ASD(NII) Memorandum (Reference (bv) and Director,\nAdministration and Management Memorandum (Reference (bw)). Some PlI also qualifies for\nprotection under the provisions of section 552a of Reference (bk) (also known and hereinafter\nreferred to as \"The Pnivacy Act of 1974, as amended'). Certain PlII requires data-at-rest\nencryption and other protections.\n b. PlI has protection and reporting requirements of which the activity security manager\nshould be aware in the event the loss or unauthorized disclosure of PlI (known as a \"breach\") is\nreported to the security office, separately or as part of an unauthorized disclosure of classified\ninfommation. Although Privacy Act and/or IT officials are responsible for addressing a breach,\nactivity security managers should be familiar with the protection and breach reporting\nrequirements, the required timeframes for such reports, and the process identified in the DoD\nComponent breach remediation plan for responding to breaches. A breach may trigger a chain of\nrequired actions, including notifications to the USCY BERCOM, United States Computer\nEmergency Readiness Team, the DoD Component Head, and DoD Privacy Act officials. Breach\n reports must be unclassified.\n10. NEW TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT. Technology, in general, and IT technology\nspecifically, changes much more quickly than infomation security policy. New products for\ndata storage, communications, access control, and intrusion detection, and new IT equipment and\nperipherals (e.g., hand-held classified devices such as the Secure Mobile Environment PED\nChange 3, 07/28/2020\n109\nENCLOSURE 7",

The activity security manager must work with the IAM and\nthe local DAA(s) to identify new risks and develop appropriate procedures to mitigate those\nupdates and/or issues should be forwarded through the security chain of command to the Director\nof Security, OUSD(I&S).\n11. INTERNET-BASED SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES. Use of Intemet-based social\nnetworking services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Y ouTube, and MySpace, is govemed by DoDI\n 8170.01 (Reference (bx). The policy addresses both official use of such capabilities and non-\nofficial use by DoD personnel. It also covers use of other publicly accessible infomation\ncapabilities and applications available on the Intemet (e.g., wikis, blogs) in locations not owned\noperated, or controlled by the Department of Defense or the Federal Govermment. As each DoD\nComponent is responsible for ensuring all uses of these services are compliant with infomation\nsecurity, IA and OPSEC policies and procedures, officials from these disciplines need to\nrequirements for protecting classified infomation and CUI from unauthorized disclosure are the\nsame when using social networking services as when using other media and methods of\ndissemination and the penalties forignoning the requirements are likewise the same.\n12. MARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRONIC INFORMATION. Regardless of\nremains. Where it is not feasible to include markings with all of the infommation required for\nclassified documents, an explanatory statement that provides the required infomation shall be\nincluded on the item or with the documentation that accompanies it.\na. For specific guidance on marking in an electronic environment, see section 17, Enclosure\n3 of Volume 2 of this Manual, as well as related infomation in section 16 (briefing slides) and\nb. The use of metadata and other electronic tags, as required by DoDI 8320.02 (Reference\n(by)), to identify the classification level, releasability, and other secunity attributes of electronic\ndata files can facilitate automated application and enforcement of security measures. However,\nit is imperative that metadata and electronic tags associated with declassified or downgraded\ninfomation in electronic fomat be reviewed and updated or deleted, as necessary, to reflect the\n actual classification and other attributes of the infomation.  Precautions must be taken to ensure\nclassified attributes are not released with unclassified data.\n13.PROCESSING REQUIREMENTSFORSPECIFIC TYPESOFINFORMATION\na. SCI.
