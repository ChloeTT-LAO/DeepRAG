Refer to\nAppendix A, “Measurement Guides\" for a list of these guides and their Anritsu part numbers.\nMeasurement guides are provided on the Documentation disc that is shipped with the\ninstrument and are also available for download (at no charge) from the Anritsu web site.\nRefer to section “Anritsu Reference Documents\" on page 1-7.\n1-7   Instrument Description\nThe Spectrum Master is a synthesizer-based handheld spectrum analyzer that provides quick\nand accurate measurement results. Measurements can be easily made by using the main\ninstrument functions: frequency, span, amplitude, and bandwidth. Dedicated keys for\ncommon functions and a familiar calculator-type keypad are available for fast data entry.\nTime and date stamping of measurement data is automatic. The internal memory provides\nfor the storage and recall of up to 1000 measurement setups and up to 1000 traces using\nMaster Software Tools (MST). External storage can be used for bulk measurement storage.\nThe bright daylight-viewable, high-resolution, color liquid crystal display (LCD) provides\neasy viewing in a variety of lighting conditions. The Spectrum Master is capable of up to\n2.5 hours of continuous operation from a fully charged battery and can be operated from a\n12 VDC source, which also simultaneously charges the battery.\nThe Spectrum Master is designed for monitoring, measuring, and analyzing signal\nenvironments. Typical measurements include: in-band interference and transmit spectrum\nanalysis, plus cell site and 802.1la/b/g interference testing. Options are available for RF,\nadvanced demodulation, and over-the-air (OTA) measurement. A full range of marker\ncapabilities (such as peak, center, and delta functions) are provided for faster, more\ncomprehensive analysis of displayed signals. Upper and lower multi-segmented limit lines\nare available to create quick, simple pass/fail measurements. A menu option provides for an\naudible alert when a limit value is exceeded.\nIn transmitter analyzer mode, the Spectrum Master displays six markers and the marker\ntable in Code Domain Power and Codogram displays. In Spectrum Analyzer mode, a full\nrange of marker capabilities is provided. Markers are not available in GSM mode.\nAnritsu Master Software Tools, a PC-based software program, provides for storing\nmeasurement data. Master Software Tools can also convert the Spectrum Master display into\nseveral graphic formats.\n1-4\nPN:10580-00277 Rev.E\nSpectrum Master UG",
    "Page_17": "Spectrum Master Specifications\nMeasurements may be stored in the internal memory or a USB flash drive. Stored\nmeasurements can be downloaded to a PC by using the included USB and Ethernet cables.\nAfter being stored, the graphic trace can then be displayed, scaled, or enhanced with markers\nand limit lines. Historical graphs can be overlaid with current data by using the PC mouse in\ndrag-and-drop fashion. The underlying data can be extracted and used in spreadsheets or for\nother analytical tasks.\nNot all USB drives are compatiblewith the instrument. Many drives comewith a\nsecond partition that contains proprietary firmware. This partition must be\nNote\nremoved. Only one partition is allowed. Refer to the individual manufacturer for\nthemusing theFAT32format.\n1-8 Spectrum Master Specifications\nRefer to the Technical Data Sheet listed in Section 1-1 for general specifications, detailed\nmeasurement specifications for all available measurement modes, ordering information,\npower sensors, and available accessories. The data sheet is included with the instrument and\nalso available on the Anritsu web site: http://www.anritsu.com.\n1-9    Calibration Requirements\nThe Spectrum Master loads factory calibration data during start-up, eliminating the need for\ndaily calibration checks. In WCDMA modes, an additional automatic calibration is performed\nas the internal temperature of the Spectrum Master changes (to insure the best possible\nmeasurement results).\nAlthough the Spectrum Master does not require daily field calibration, Anritsu Company\nrecommends annual calibration and performance verification by local Anritsu service centers.\n1-10 Preventive Maintenance\nSpectrum Master preventive maintenance consists of cleaning the unit and inspecting and\ncleaning the RF connectors on the instrument and on all accessories. Clean the\nSpectrum Master with a soft, lint-free cloth that is dampened with water or with water and a\nmild cleaning solution.\nCautionTo avoid damage to the display or case, do not use solvents or abrasive cleaners\nClean the RF connectors and center pins with a cotton swab dampened with denatured\nalcohol. Visually inspect the connectors. The fingers of N(f) connectors and the pins of N(m)\nconnectors should be unbroken and uniform in appearance. If you are unsure whether the\nconnectors are good, then gauge the connectors to confirm that their dimensions are correct.\nVisually inspect test port cables. Test port cables should be uniform in appearance, not\nstretched, kinked, dented, or broken.\nSpectrum Master UG\nPN:10580-00277 Rev.E\n1-5",
    "Page_18": "ESD Cautions\n1-11  ESD Cautions\nThe MS272xC, like other high performance instruments, is susceptible to ESD (electrostatic\ndischarge) damage. Coaxial cables and antennas often build up a static charge, which may\ndamage the MS272xC input circuitry (if allowed to discharge by connecting directly to the\n MS272xC without previously discharging the static charge). MS272xC operators must be\naware of the potential for ESD damage and take all necessary precautions.\nOperators should exercise practices outlined within industry standards such as JEDEC-625\n(EIA-625), MIL-HDBK-263, and MIL-STD-1686, which pertain to ESD and ESDS devices,\nequipment, and practices. Because these apply to the MS272xC, Anritsu Company\nrecommends that any static charges that may be present be dissipated before connecting\ncoaxial cables or antennas to the MS272xC. This may be as simple as temporarily attaching a\nshort or load device to the cable or antenna prior to attaching to the MS272xC. Remember\nthat the operator may also carry a static charge that can cause damage. Following the\npractices outlined in the above standards ensures a safe environment for both personnel and\nequipment.\n1-6\nPN:10580-00277 Rev.E\nSpectrum Master UG",

The intent\nof this chapter is to provide a starting point for making basic measurement setups. This\nchapter describes setup, configure frequency, bandwidth, and amplitude before configuring\nyour measurement setups. After measurements are taken, refer to section “Managing Files\"\non page 4-1 for a description of saving, recalling, and deleting measurement files. For more\ndetailed information about specific measurements, refer to the measurement descriptions in\nthe measurement guides for the specific instrument mode and analyzer technology (such as\nSpectrum Analyzer, WiMAX, or 3GPP). Refer to Appendix A, “Measurement Guides\", for a\nlist of these measurement guides and their Anritsu part numbers.\nThe Spectrum Analyzer Measurement Guide includes sections that describe resolution\nbandwidth, video bandwidth, sweep, and attenuator functions. For example, in the\nSpectrum Master, Resolution Bandwidth is determined by the intermediate frequency (IF)\nfilter bandwidth. The spectrum analyzer traces the shape of the IF filter as it tunes past a\nsignal. If more than one IF filter is used in a spectrum analyzer, then the narrowest one\ndominates and is considered the resolution bandwidth. Figure 3-1 is an example of a\nspectrogram display.\nnritsu 05/27/2010 10:23:46 am\nMeasurements\nSpectrum\nSpectrogram\nSignal Strength\n310.m\nRSSI\nSignal ID\n30dB\nInterference\nMapping\n70.0\ntart Freq 862.200 MHz\n130 dBm\nFreq\nAmplitude\nMeasurements\nMarker\nFigure 3-1.\nSpectrogramExample\nSpectrum Master UG\nPN:10580-00277Rev.E\n3-1",

The major\nsections of this chapter include:\n. “Master Software Tools Overview\" on page 7-1\n·“MST Feature Overview\" on page 7-1\n.“Updating Instrument Firmware\" on page 7-2\n7-2  Master Software Tools Overview\nAnritsu Master Software Tools is a Microsoft Windows compatible program (for\nWindows 2000, Windows XP, and 64-bit Windows Vista) for transferring and editing saved\nmeasurements, markers, and limit lines to a PC. Master Software Tools will not function on\nearlier versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system.\n7-3 MST Feature Overview\nCapturing or Retrieving Traces\nMST includes a feature to capture the current screen and associated data from the test\ninstrument to the Master Software Tools Graphic Display Editor window. Saved files on the\ntest instrument can also be retrieved and displayed or edited with Master Software Tools.\nEditing Graphs\nMST can be used to change the scale, limit lines, and markers in a measurement through the\nEdit Graph button in the workspace toolbar, or through the Context Menus.\nContext Menus\nContext Menus are accessed by right-clicking the mouse on an active measurement screen in\nthe Graphic Display Editor Window. Context Menu functions may include commands that are\nalso available on the pull down menus and toolbar buttons, or functions, commands, and\noptions specific to the active measurement window.\nOverlayingTraces\nTrace Math and Overlays allow for comparing multiple traces.\nFolder Spectrogram\nFolder Spectrogram provides a simulated three dimensional view of a large amount of data in\none set of graphs.\n3D Spectrogram View\nSpectrum Master UG\nPN:10580-00277 Rev.E\n7-1",

The amber LED shows the presence of a\n10 Mbit/s LAN connection when on, and a 100 Mbit/s LAN connection when off. The green\nLED flashes to show that LAN traffic is present. The instrument IP address is set by pressing\nthe Shift key, then the System (8) key followed by the System Options submenu key and the\nEthernet Config submenu key. The instrument Ethernet address can be set automatically using\nDHCP, or manually by entering the desired IP address, gateway address, and subnet mask.\nAn active Ethernet cable must be connected to the instrument before it is turned\nON in order to enable the Ethernet port for DHCP or for a static IP address\nNote\nfrom DHCP to static IP address, when changing from static IP address to DHCP,\nor when temporarily disconnecting the Ethernet cable.\nIf the port becomes disabled, then ensure that an active Ethernet cable is attached\nto the instrument before cycling the power OFF and back ON.\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an Internet protocol that automates the\nprocess of setting IP addresses for devices that use TCP/IP, and is the most common method\nof configuring a device for network use. To determine if a network is set up for DHCP, connect\nthe MS272xC to the network and select DHCP protocol in the Ethernet Config menu.\nTurn the Spectrum Master off, and then on.

    "Page_103": "DHCP\nC-3 DHCP\nDHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol that allows a server to\ndynamically assign IP addresses to devices that are connected to the network. Most networks\ninclude a DHCP server to manage IP addresses. When a DHCP server is available on the\nnetwork, DHCP is the preferred IP address assignment mode.\nWhen using DHCP, no setup is required to lease and use a dynamic IP address. In a dynamic\nIP operation, the IP address in use may change from use to use. The DHCP server hands out\nIP addresses on a first come, first served basis. As soon as the device is disconnected from the\nnetwork, the IP address that it was using becomes available to lease to the next unit that\nrequests an IP address. Normally, some amount oflag time is present on the DHCP server\nend, so if the device is connected again reasonably soon, then it may end up with the same\naddress.\nWhen a DHCP server is not available, a Static IP address can be used. A Static IP address is\na fixed address. After being set, it will always remain the same, and care must be taken to not\nconflict with other equipment on the network.\nWhen using a static IP address on an established network, always request the Static IP\naddress from the network administrator. Randomly choosing a Static IP address on an\nestablished network may result in duplicate IP addresses or other conflicts.\nThree parameters must be set prior to using a Static IP address:\nIP Address\nThis is the Static IP address on the network.\nDefaultGateway\nOften when a static IP address is assigned, a default gateway is also identified. If the\ndefault gateway is unknown, then type in the Static IP address so that the Static IP\naddress and Default Gateway are the same number\nSubnet Mask\nThis parameter is usually extracted from the Static IP address based on the class of the\naddress and determines the destination of any broadcast messages that might be sent\nfrom the instrument. It can be customized if necessary. The subnet mask may also be\nprovided with the Static IP address.\nExample 1\nIn this example, a Static IP address has been chosen because no network DHCP service is\navailable. The instrument is connected to the network port on the PC with a crossover\nEthernet cable (not included). This is also referred to as Direct Connect:\nIP Address: 10.0.0.2\nDefault Gateway: 10.0.0.2\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.0.0\nSpectrum Master UG\nPN:10580-00277 Rev.E\nC-5",
