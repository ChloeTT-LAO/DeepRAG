This paper\npresents a study  of the behavior of monopolar HVDC system in the presence of a single double-\ntuned dc filter. CIGRE Benchmark model for monopolar HVDC system has been simulated on\nPSCAD/EMTDC for the study. Five different fault locations, viz. three dc line faults (two faults\nnear the line ends and the third fault at the middle point of the line) and two ac side faults (one\nnear the rectifier and the other near the inverter), and five different values of fault resistance\n(ranging from 0 to 2000 ohms) have been considered. It has been observed that incremental current\nand incremental power in the HVDC line can discriminate only mid-line dc faults from ac fault.\nAlso, incremental current can discriminate between rectifier-side ac fault and inverter-side ac fault\nfor all values of fault resistance, whereas incremental power can do so only for lower values of\nfault resistance (0 ohm and 10 ohms).

However, apart from so many advantages, there are\nhence, the investigation to find out available possible solutions to overcome these issues becomes\nessential in order to enhance the performance of grid-connected PVs.

This will be a replacement of the costly\nattachments which the physically challenged driver adds to their vehicle. The shock absorbers\nwould be included accordingly in the mechanism. The probable improvements on deploying the\nsaid mechanism on a two wheeler will provide easy riding, as the vehicle self-stabilize itself\nwhen the small wheels are grounded. This will help the less abled riders to easily ride the\nvehicle with no worries of grounding their feet. This idea developed by the authors is a result\nof conceptualization and brainstorming. A number of designs were developed, studied and three\ndesigns were shortlisted based on the feasibility of the mechanism. Finally, a better design is\n proposed for further implementation.\nKeywords: - Stability mechanism, Safety, Two wheeler, Hydraulic system.\n08th - 09th October 2018\nSV-TDFS - 18\nISBN: 978-81-938236-5-1\nOrganized by:\nManipal University Jaipur\nAnd\nInstitute For Engineering Research and Publication (IFERP)\nPage | 54",

Particulate\nflow through pipeline gaining popularity because of eco-friendly nature and less maintenance\ncharges. For long distance slurry transportation, it requires large capacity pumps and encountered\nwith huge pressure loss along pipeline. Slurry transportation with higher solid mass concentration\nalso leads to sedimentation of particles. Higher concentration BA slurry have settling\ncharacteristics which results in high pressure loss and also the sedimentation bed needs more\npower for flow in pipeline. This loss can be minimised by improving the rheological properties of\nslurry flowing through pipelines. Rheological behaviour of the slurry is highly influenced by\nchemical additives and hence flow behaviour of slurry in pipelines can be changed. The focus of\nthis research is to experimentally examine the effect of chemical additives and higher shear rate\nover the rheological behaviour of fine particle bottom ash slurries. Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium\nBromide (CTAB) and Sodium Salicylate (NaSal) are used as chemical additives in slurry samples.\nExperimental results show that the rheological properties of BA slurry are very much affected by\nchemical additives, shear rate and particle size range of BA. Combined effect of shear rates and\ndosages of chemical additives were investigated and gives encouraging results.\n08th - 09th October 2018\nSV-TDFS - 18\nISBN: 978-81-938236-5-1\nOrganized by:\nManipal University Jaipur\nAnd\nInstitute For Engineering Research and Publication (IFERP)\nPage | 55",

However, biodiesel is vulnerable to oxidative degradation due to autoxidation in the\nexistence of oxygen, which hampers its extensive usage. Addition of antioxidant is a probable\nanswer to achieve clean burning and improved combustion characteristic of biodiesel. An objective\nof the research paper is to experimentally study the influence of antioxidant accumulation to WFO\nbiodiesel on diesel engine performance. WFOME was produced through transesterification\nprocess. Two monophenolic antioxidants, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHA) and 2(3)-tert-\nbutyl-4-methoxy phenol (BHT), were added at 950 ppm absorption to B40 ( 40% WFOME and\n60 % diesel) for this investigation. Increased oxidation stability of B40 was noticed with addition\nof antioxidants without causing any significant negative effect on properties of WFOME.

The outcomes illustrate that\nantioxidant-treated B40 produced 2.15% to 4.78% higher brake thermal efficiency and BSFC by\n2.08 % to 4.74% compared to untreated B40.

Measuring a liquid's flash point requires an ignition source. At the flash\npoint, the vapor may cease to burn when the source of ignition is removed. The flash point is not\nto be confused with the auto ignition temperature, which does not require an ignition source. The\nfire point, a higher temperature, is defined as the temperature at which the vapor continues to burn\nafter being ignited. Neither the flash point nor the fire point is related to the temperature of the\nignition source or of the burning liquid, which are much higher.\nThe flash point is often used as a descriptive characteristic of liquid fuel, and it is also used to help\ncharacterize the fire hazards of liquids. “Flash point\" refers to both flammable liquids and\ncombustible liquids. There are various standards for defining each term. Flash and fire point is one\nof the important criteria for determining the process safety while handling the rubber compound\n during mixing, calendaring, extrusion etc. Higher flash and fire point of oils always indicates good\nprocess safety.
