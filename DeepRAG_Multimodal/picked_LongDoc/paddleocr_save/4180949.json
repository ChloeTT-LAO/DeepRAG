Some I²c devices can act as masters or slaves, but the TLV320AlC32 can only act as a slave\ndevice.\nAn I?C bus consists of two lines, SDA and SCL. SDA carries data; SCL provides the clock. All data is transmitted\nacross the I?C bus in groups of eight bits. To send a bit on the I²C bus, the SDA line is driven to the appropriate\nlevel while SCL is LOW (a LOW on SDA indicates the bit is zero; a HIGH indicates the bit is one). Once the SDA\nline has settled, the SCL line is brought HIGH, then LOW. This pulse on SCL clocks the SDA bit into the\nreceivers shift register.\nThe I?C bus is bidirectional: the SDA line is used both for transmitting and receiving data. When a master reads\ns         as    a   s     o\nUnder normal circumstances the master drives the clock line.\nMost of the time the bus is idle, no communication is taking place, and both lines are HlGH. When\ncommunication is taking place, the bus is active. Only master devices can start a communication. They do this by\ncausing a START condition on the bus. Normally, the data line is only allowed to change state while the clock\nline is LOW. If the data line changes state while the clock line is HIGH, it is either a START condition or its\nHIGH to LOW. A STOP condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from LOW to HIGH.\nwhich it responds. (Slaves can also have 10-bit addresses; see the I²?C specification for details.) The master\nsends an address in the address byte, together with a bit that indicates whether it wishes to read from or write to\nthe slave device.\nEvery byte transmitted on the I?c bus, whether it is address or data, is acknowledged with an acknowledge bit.\nWhen a master has finished sending a byte (eight data bits) to a slave, it stops driving SDA and waits for the\nclock pulse to clock the acknowledge bit. Similarly, when a master has finished reading a byte, it pulls SDA LOw\nto acknowledge this to the slave. It then sends a clock pulse to clock the bit.\nA not-acknowledge is performed by simply leaving SDA HIGH during an acknowledge cycle. If a device is not\npresent on the bus, and the master attempts to address it, it will receive a not-acknowledge because no device\nis present at that address to pull the line Low.\nWhen a master has finished communicating with a slave, it may issue a STOP condition. When a STOP\nSTART condition is issued while the bus is active, it is called a repeated START condition.\nCopyright @ 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nSubmit Documentation Feedback\n19\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC32",

By\nchanging the programmable offset, the bit clock in each frame where the data begins can be changed, and the\nis being put onto the bus. This allows other codecs to be programmed with different offsets and to drive their\ndata onto the same DouT line, just in a different slot. For incoming data, the codec simply ignores data on the\nbus except where it is expected based on the programmed offset.\nNote that the location of the data when an offset is programmed is different, depending on what transfer mode is\nselected. In DsP mode, both left and right channels of data are transferred immediately adjacent to each other in\napart in each frame. In this case, as the offset is programmed from zero to some higher value, both the left and\nright channel data move across the frame, but still stay a full half-frame apart from each other. This is depicted in\nFigure 24 for the two cases.\n22\nSubmit Documentation Feedback\nCopyright @ 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC32",

The converters can also operate at\ndifferent sampling rates in various combinations, which are described further below.\nThe data converters are based on the concept of an Fsref rate that is used internal to the part, and it is related to\nthe actual sampling rates of the converters through a series of ratios. For typical sampling rates, Fsref will be\neither 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, although it can realistically be set over a wider range of rates up to 53 kHz, with\nadditional restrictions applying if the PLL is used. This concept is used to set the sampling rates of the ADC and\nDAC, and also to enable high quality playback of low sampling rate data, without high frequency audible noise\nbeing generated.\nThe sampling rate of the ADC and DAC can be set to Fsref/NDAC or 2xF sref/NDAC, with NDAC being 1, 1.5, 2,\n2.5, 3, 3.5,4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 0r 6.\nAUDIO CLOCK GENERATION\n      s     i     \nA more detailed diagram of the audio clock section of the TLV320AlC32 is shown in Figure 25\nCopyright @ 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nSubmit Documentation Feedback\n23\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC32",

This circuitry\nautomatically adjusts the PGA gain as the input signal becomes overly loud or very weak, such as when a\nperson speaking into a microphone moves closer or farther from the microphone. The AGC algorithm has several\nPGA gain applicable that allow the algorithm to be fine tuned for any particular application. The algorithm uses\nthe absolute average of the signal (which is the average of the absolute value of the signal) as a measure of the\nnominal amplitude of the output signal.\nNote that completely independent AGC circuitry is included with each ADC channel with entirely independent\ncontrol over the algorithm from one channel to the next. This is attractive in cases where two microphones are\nused in a system, but may have different placement in the end equipment and require different dynamic\nperformance for optimal system operation.\nTarget gain represents the nominal output level at which the AGC attempts to hold the ADC output signal level.\n-24 dB relative to a full-scale signal. Since the device reacts to the signal absolute average and not to peak\nlevels, it is recommended that the larger gain be set with enough margin to avoid clipping at the occurrence of\nloud sounds.\nAttack time determines how quickly the AGC circuitry reduces the PGA gain when the input signal is too loud. It\ncan be varied from 8 ms to 20 ms.\nDecay time determines how quickly the PGA gain is increased when the input signal is too low. It can be varied\nin the range from 100 ms to 500 ms.\nNoise gate threshold determines the level below which if the input speech average value falls, AGC considers it\nensures that noise does not get gained up in the absence of speech.

Note that each of these drivers\nhave a output level control block like those included with the line output drivers, allowing gain adjustment up to\n+9dB on the output signal. As in the previous case, this output level adjustment is not intended to be used as a\nstandard volume control, but instead is included for additional fullscale output signal level control.\nTwo of the output drivers, HPROUT and HPLOUT, include a direct connection path for the stereo DAC outputs to\nbe passed directly to the output drivers and bypass the analog volume controls and mixing networks, using the\nDAC_L2/R2 path.

However, this generally results in the output nodes\ndrifting to rest near the upper or lower analog supply, due to small leakage currents at the pins. This then results\nin a longer delay requirement to avoid output artifacts during driver power-on. In order to reduce this required\npower-on delay, the TLV320AiC32 includes an option for the output pins of the drivers to be weakly driven to the\nVCM level they would normally rest at when powered with no signal applied. This output VC M level is determined\nby an internal bandgap voltage reference, and thus results in extra power dissipation when the drivers are in\npowerdown. However, this option provides the fastest method for transitioning the drivers from powerdown to full\npower operation without any output artifact introduced.\nvoltage of approximately half the DRVDD1/2 supply level using an internal voltage divider. This voltage will not\nmatch the actual vCM of a fully powered driver, but due to the output voltage being close to its final value, a\nmuch shorter power-up delay time setting can be used and still avoid any audible output artifacts. These output\nvoltage options are controlled in Page-0/Reg-42.\nattenuated state, then the output driver will automatically slowly reduce the output attenuation to reach the\ndesired output level setting programmed. This capability is enabled by default and can be controlled by\nPage-0/Reg-40.\nSHORT CIRCUIT OUTPUT PROTECTION\nThe TLV320AiC32 includes programmable short-circuit protection for the high power output drivers, for maximum\nflexibility in a given application. By default, if these output drivers are shorted, they will automatically limit the\nmaximum amount of current that can be sourced to or sunk from a load, thereby protecting the device from an\nover-current condition. In this mode, the user can read Page-0/Reg-95 to determine whether the part is in\nshort-circuit protection or not, and then decide whether to program the device to power down the output drivers.\nHowever, the device includes further capability to automatically power down an output driver whenever it does\na power down condition until the user specifically programs it to power down and then power back up again, to\nclear the short-circuit flag.\nCONTROL REGISTERS\nPage O / Register O:Page Select Register\nBIT(1)\nREAD/\nRESET\nDESCRIPTION\nWRITE\nVALUE\nD7-D1\nX\n0000000\nReserved, write only zeros to these register bits\nDO\nR/W\n0\nPage Select Bit\n accessed for future register read/writes.\n(1)  When resetting registers related to routing and volume controls of output drivers, it is recommended to reset them by writing directly to\nthe registers instead of using software reset.\n38\nSubmit Documentation Feedback\n Copyright @ 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC32",
