A previous qualitative\nstudy found A F to substantially affect patients? emotional wellbeing, social relationships,\nemployment, and finances. Existing quality of life questionnaires do not adequately assess\nthe A F impact. In this thesis, a new patient-reported questionnaire was developed to measure\nthe impact of AF as experienced by patients. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted\non the new questionnaire, revealing five domains: “Affect\", “\"Social Support\", “Major Life\nattainment, and time of last episode were significantly associated with the overall score\nFemale gender was associated with a worse diagnostic experience after adjusting for\ncovariates, confirming previous qualitative findings. The new questionnaire has good internal\nconsistency and can be used to study variables associated with the A F impact.\nKeywords\nA trial Fibrillation, Measurement, Patient-Reported Outcome Measure, Patient Jourmey,\nQuality of Life, Factor A nalysis\n11",

Apart from\nrate, the normal heart also follows a characteristic rhythm that can be detected on an\nelectrocardiogram. Departures from a regular rate or rhythm are referred to as arrhythmias.\nA trial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia where the heart beats too\nfast or too slow and out of rhythm. Patients with AF can often feel their hearts pounding or\nracing and experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty exercising.\ndizziness, and fatigue. AF can affect a patient's wellbeing as soon as they begin to\nexperience symptoms. Previously, focus groups and interviews with patients revealed that\ngetting a diagnosis of A F was difficult because some physicians did not take patients?\nsymptoms seriously. It was also found that AF affected patients’ emotional wellbeing, social\nrelationships, employment, and personal finances.\nWe developed a questionnaire, called Mapping the Impact of Atrial Fibrillation (MA P-A F),\nand used it to study the life impacts of AF on patients. A statistical technique called factor\nanalysis allowed us to determine the different areas of peoples’ lives that AF impacts. By\nexamining these areas, or “domains\", we were able to see whether the MA P-AF measures\nwhat it was supposed to measure. We found five domains underlying 16 questions. They\n\"Diagnostic Experience\". The MAP-AF allows us to calculate a total score and a score for\neach of the five domains for each person. We found patients who were younger, divorced or\ntotal scores and were more impacted by AF. Confirming previous findings, our results\nshowed female patients to score higher (i.e., worse) on “Diagnostic Experience” than male\npatients. After our results are confirmed in a separate group of patients, the MA P-AF\nquestionnaire can be used to study how AF affects the wellbeing of patients, identify patient\nneeds, and improve healthcare services. Timely diagnosis and empathetic care are essential\nfor patient-centered A F management.\nii",

A trial fibrillation\n(AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is associated with significant\nmorbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden?. As estimated by the Global Burden of\nDisease project, 46.3 million individuals around the world were living with AF or atrial\nflutter in 20163. Prevalence of AF is higher in developed countries, especially in Northerm\nEurope and the United States (US), and lower in the Asia-Pacific area34.\nThe incidence and prevalence of AF are expected to rise globally as a result of population\naging, increasing prevalence of AF risk factors, and enhanced AF detection24-6. By 2030,\n14 - 17 million individuals in the European Union are expected to have AF2; by 2050, 6 -\n16 million individuals in the US alone are anticipated to have A F6.\nWhile the arrhythmia itself is not fatal, A F-related complications like heart failure (HF),\ntachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, and stroke put A F patients at an elevated risk of\ncardiovascular and all-cause mortality2.6.7. A F is associated with a 2- to 5-fold increase in\nthe risk of stroke 4.68, and 20% - 30% of all ischemic strokes are attributable to AF2.\nA dditional morbidity includes cognitive impairment (e.g., vascular dementia) and\ncardiovascular morbidity (e.g., cardiomyopathy, left ventricular dysfunction) 29.\nFrom the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation\n(ORBIT-AF) study, 31% of AF patients had one or more hospitalizations after a one-year\nfollow-uplo. Another population-based study in the US found that 1.5% of all\nhospitalizations listed AF as the primary cause, and 12% of all hospitalizations listed AF\nas a secondary cause or comorbidity7. The cost of emergency department visits and\nhospitalizations related to AF represents a significant burden on the healthcare system2",
    "Page_18": "9\n2.1.1  Diagnosis and classification\nA F rhythm is characterized by irregular RR intervals and the absence of distinct P waves\non the electrocardiogram29. In contrast, atrial flutter typically has atrial activity with a\n\"saw tooth” morphology\". According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)\nguidelines, clinical AF is diagnosed when an electrocardiography (ECG) documented A F\nepisode lasts at least 30 seconds. The standard diagnostic procedure for patients reporting\nA F symptoms or patients who had a recent cryptogenic stroke involves a 12-lead ECG in\nthe clinic. If the 12-lead ECG does not indicate ongoing AF, a 24/48-hour Holter monitor\nor other prolonged ECG monitoring methods (e.g., 7- to 30-day event monitors) are\nattempted to document A F11.\nA F can be clinically classified into paroxysmal or persistent based on the duration and\nSociety (CCS) guidelines for AF management, paroxysmal AF is defined as “a\ncontinuous AF episode lasting longer than 30 seconds but terminating within 7 days of\nonset\" and persistent AF as “a continuous AF episode lasting longer than 7 days but less\nthan 1 year?12. Paroxysmal AF that is short-lasting and intermittent may not be present\nduring 12-lead ECG or 24/48-hour Holter monitoring - in this case, repeated and\nprolonged monitoring may be necessary to diagnose A F11. Progression from paroxysmal\nto more persistent forms of AF is common when AF is left untreated?.\nBesides overt clinical AF, there is also silent atrial fibrillation (SAF), where patients are\nasymptomatic and unaware of their arrhythmia4. It is estimated that approximately one-\nthird of all AF is asymptomatic and subclinical4.5,13. Despite the absence of symptoms,\nthe prognostic impact of SAF is considered to be the same as symptomatic clinical AF4,14.\nTherefore, delays in diagnosis can allow the disease to progress to more severe forms and\nexacerbate the risk of stroke and other complicationsf\". Unfortunately, SAF often remains\nundetected until a patient experiences an adverse effect of AF and presents to the\nmay also be incidentally detected by implanted pacemakers or during routine\nphysicals4,5,15.",
    "Page_19": "Recently, promising screening devices that are non-invasive (i.e., smartwatches) have\nbeen developed to enhance A F detection and expedite treatment initiation12.\n2.1.2Symptoms\nSymptoms related to AF are highly variable between individuals and in the same\nindividuals over time13. The most common symptoms, however, are palpitations, chest\nsleeping difficulties, dizziness, psychosocial distress, and fatigue2.13. In some patients,\nsyncope and presyncope can be present13. Not all symptoms reported are attributable to\nAF because risk factors and comorbidities of AF may also produce similar symptoms13\nThe CCS 2020 guidelines described four symptom severity scales12:\nThe European Heart Rhythm A ssociation (EHRA) Classification and the Canadian\nclinician-reported measures; the University of T'oronto A trial Fibrillation Severity Scale\n(AFSS) and the Atrial Fibrillation Symptom Severity and Burden (AFS/B) scale are two\npatient-reported measures12.\nAs mentioned earlier, asymptomatic AF is considered to have the same prognostic\nimpact as symptomatic A F4,14.

Two studies found\nthat symptom severity does not correlate well with global life satisfaction, and quality of\nlife may be reduced even in asymptomatic individuals5.16.\nGender and sex-based analyses in health can provide valuable insight into biological\ndifferences and potential health disparities.

Timely initiation of\nmanagement is critical to reduce symptoms and complications and slow the progression\nof AF4.\nFollowing diagnosis, stroke and bleeding risk are assessed to guide decisions to\nanticoagulate. While the CHA DS2 is the reference tool for stratifying stroke risk in\nclinical guidelines, the CHA 2D S2-VASc score is more commonly used in clinical\npractice8,25,26. The letters “CHADS\" stands for congestive heart failure, hypertension,\nage ≥ 75, diabetes, and stroke; and \"VASc”’ stands for vascular disease, age 65-74, and\nsex category female9.25,26. The numeric “2” distinguishes factors with a much higher risk\nof stroke, for which 2 points (one additional point on the score) are warranted. A higher\nscore on both instruments indicates a greater need for anticoagulation.\nW arfarin and oral anticoagulants (OA C) effectively reduce the risk of stroke but can\nproduce side effects such as major bleeding?9. An individual with a high risk of bleeding,\nas assessed by scales like the HA S-BLED score, may be a candidate for percutaneous left\natrial appendage occlusion instead of OA C for stroke prevention9.27.\nW hile stroke prevention reduces stroke-related mortality, cardiovascular mortality due to\nother causes is still common in anticoagulated individuals?. Risk factors, underlying\ndisease, and comorbidity management are essential to reduce other causes of mortality.\nA longside stroke prevention, ventricular rate control should be initiated for recent-onset\nAF patients. The most common pharmacologic rate control interventions are β-blockers\nand non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, both of which can slow the atrial\nfibrillation heart rate to a target range2.8.",

Otherwise, it is indicated when ventricular rate control fails to adequately\nalleviate symptoms. For patients with persistent AF, sinus rhythm can be restored by\npharmacologic cardioversion (antiarrhythmic drugs) or direct current cardioversion along\nwith a rhythm medication to maintain sinus rhythm once it is restored.\nA miodarone is both a rate and rhythm control drug*9. W hile it is more efficacious than\nother antiarrhythmic drugs, it should be reserved for highly symptomatic patients because\nof its potential for long-term adverse side effects89.\nFor patients who remain symptomatic despite rate and rhythm control medications,\nablation has been found to effectively restore sinus rhythm, improve quality of life, and\nreduce hospital admissionsa.\nA trio-ventricular nodal ablation with pacing is another type of ablation procedure.

For\nexample, women were less likely to receive electrical cardioversion or ablation than\nmen17,18,29.\nOverall, patients with A F face unique challenges.

Patients navigating through the AF illness experience are faced\nwith much uncertainty. We will be able to better address patient needs and preferences\n2.2  Patient-centered care\nPatient-centered care was a new concept in medicine in the early 5Os and had roots in\nCarl Rogers? client-centered therapy. Client-centered therapy emerged from humanistic\nbe treated as active participants in consultations, the therapist as an agent rather than an\nauthority30. This approach encouraged clients to tell their own stories, believing that\nclients know themselves best. Medical psychoanalyst Michael Balint proposed a similar\nconcept in the medical field, coining the term “patient-centered medicine*31-34.\nThis new perspective and approach to medicine were, to a large degree, a response to the\nlimitations of traditional medicine31,35. The traditional biomedical model was “illness-\ncentered\"', interested primarily in localizing disease entities and resolving physiological\naberrations31.35. During this time, physicians practicing under this illness-centered lens\nhad difficulty helping patients who had complaints but for whom clinical investigations\nidentified no obvious physical cause?6. In response, Balint explained how the doctor's\naffective response might play a role in alleviating or exacerbating the patient's\nillness31.34,36. He further urged physicians to examine patients as whole persons when\nmaking a diagnosis or prescribing treatment 31.34.\nSince Balint's pioneering work, there has been a growing interest and emphasis on\npatient-centered care. It is now widely acknowledged as a core value in medicine. In fact,\npatient-centered care is one of six establishing aims put forth by the Institute of Medicine\nin the US for the 21st-century healthcare system37.\nWith the growing body of literature on the topic, various definitions of patient-centered\ncare have been proposed35,3839. The general consensus is that “patient-centeredness\"",

Akin to Roger's client-\ncentered therapy, at the core of patient-centered care is the moral imperative of respecting\npatients as unique living beings34,38.\nWe describe two popularly cited frameworks that aim to clarify the concept of patient-\ncenteredcare.\nIn 1995, Stewart and colleagues from the Department of Family Medicine at W estern\nUniversity (Ontario, Canada) developed a model to define the patient-doctor relationship\nDr. lan R McW hinney and Dr. Joseph Levenstein and initially had six components:\nexploring the disease and illness experience, understanding the whole person, finding\ncommon ground, incorporating prevention and health promotion, enhancing the patient\nclinician relationship, and being realistic*4. In 2014, the framework was revised to have\nrealistic'. The earliest version of the model remains one of the most cited in family\nmedicine33.\nMead and Bower (200o) reviewed the literature on existing patient-centered care models\n(including Stewart's work) and synthesized aspects of the patient-doctor relationship\ncharacterized by patient-centeredness?5. Five key dimensions of patient-centeredness\nwere proposed by Mead and Bower, including the biopsychosocial perspective, patient\nSeveral similarities can be found between the two conceptual frameworks described.

It requires\nphysicians to appreciate the patient's feelings about being ill, their ideas about the illness,\ntheir expectations from healthcare providers, and how the illness is affecting theii\nfunctioning.\nSimilarly, both the “biopsychosocial perspective” and “patient-as-person\" dimensions of\nprovided a powerful example to illustrate how one disease may affect two individuals in a\ncompletely different manner. W hile an office worker may be able to resume work\nfollowing a leg fracture, a professional athlete may be facing an end of their career with\nthe same injury. The distress experienced is different for the two individuals. In addition,\ntreatments do not always alleviate suffering for patients. The side effects and threats to a\npatient's sense of self may be reasons why some patients decline life-saving cancer\ntreatments. It is imperative to examine the patient's circumstances and attitudes when\ncaring for them, as they may help physicians identify the best courses of action35.\nUnderstanding the patient's lived experiences with illness not only helps clinicians\nidentify patient needs and shortcomings of the healthcare system but is also a means of\nachieving patient-centered care.\n2.4 Collecting data on the patient perspective\nA ttributes of patient-centered care are best evaluated using measures of the patient's\nperception33. To learn about the illness experience, we must refer to the experts on this\ntopic - the patients themselves. Interviews and self-administered questionnaires are\nmethods to collect information and expertise from patients",
    "Page_25": "13\nThese questionnaires are generally referred to as “patient-reported measures” and can\nmeasure a variety of concepts. There are two main groups of these measures in the\nliterature: patient-reported outcome measures and patient-reported experience measures.\nThe former is primarily used to evaluate the effectiveness of care, and the latter to\nevaluate and improve healthcare services.\n2.4.1  Effects of care and PROMs\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess the patients’ perceived effects of\ntheir care. The “effects\"” or “outcomes\"” measured can range from pain level, physical\nunderstanding how disease affects patients′ wellbeing, we will restrict our subsequent\ndiscussion of PROMs to QoL instruments.\nOne context of the use of PROMs is in clinical trials. For example, a QoL questionnaire\nis administered to patients before and after an intervention to assess QoL changes due to\nmeasured by validated instruments, as an indication or labelling claim on medical\nproducts42,43. It is currently the goal of many questionnaire developers to get their QoL\ninstruments approved for use in clinical trials. For this purpose, questionnaires need to be\nresponsive to interventions - that is, items in such questionnaires often measure aspects\nof QoL most responsive to health changes.\nQuality of life is a theoretical construct that cannot be directly observed or measured4. It\ncan be understood as “a multidimensional concept that ... often involves the concept of\nhappiness, subjective wellbeing, and the meaning given to life?44. V arious interpretations\nof QoL exist, and no single definition is used consistently.\nThe World Health Organization Quality of Life (W HOQOL) Group in 1995 defined QoL\nas:\n\"individuals’ perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and\nvalue systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations,\nstandards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way",
    "Page_26": "14\nby the person's physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social\nrelationships and their relationship to salient features of their environment?45.\nThis definition recognizes the multidimensionality of QoL and the influence of cultural\nand person values on one's perceived meaning of QoL46,47. Preliminary testing of the\ngroup's global generic QoL questionnaire, WHOQOL, revealed four domains of QoL:\nphysical, psychological, social relationships, and environment45. Themes considered\nfinancial resources45.\nA nother relevant concept is health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which is also what\nmany PROMs are said to measure. Unfortunately, various interpretations of HRQoL\nexist, leading to substantial confusion around the term44.48. One definition of HRQoL is\naspects of self-perceived wellbeing that are affected by the presence of disease49. In other\nwords, a measure of how patients are impacted by ill-health50,51. However, this\ninterpretation of HRQoL brings about another discussion - that is, what aspects of QoL\nare not affected by health or ill-health, especially when indirect influences are considered.\nChronic illness affects almost all aspects of life. Guyatt et al. (1993) asserted that “when\na patient is ill or diseased, almost all aspects of life can become health related?52.\nMoreover, different diseases have different mechanisms of affecting QoL46. Therefore,\ndiseases to uncover aspects of wellbeing most impacted by the particular health problem\nEvaluating the impacts of disease on a patient's life is precisely the requisite for\n\"exploring the disease and illness experience\" - one component of Stewart's patient\ncentered clinical method34.\nA n evaluation of existing (HR)QoL questionnaires for AF found that most were adequate\nat assessing physical functioning, symptoms, and psychological impacts (Chang J et al.\nlike social relationships, employment, and personal finances were overlooked. Most\nquestionnaires were developed for use in clinical trials instead of as a tool for routine use\nin the clinic.",
    "Page_27": "15\n2.4.2  Patient experience, PREMs, and patient journey mapping\nPatient-reported experience measures (PREMs) typically concern patients’ experiences\nwith practical aspects of healthcare services such as wait times and patient-provider\ncommunication41,50. They evaluate the patient's experience or satisfaction with a\nparticular clinical encounter (e.g., surgery or consultation) to improve healthcare\ndelivery53. The majority of PREMs do not explore the patient's lived experiences and are\nnot designed to understand how a chronic disease may affect multiple aspects of an\nindividual's life over an extensive period of time.\nAdult Inpatient Survey. It was used to assess patients’ experiences with the catheter\nablation procedures performed in England54.\nVisit-based PREMs fragment the patient experience. In reality, patients receive care from\ndifferent groups and move across healthcare providers and institutions55. The result is\nhealthcare providers only seeing the component of care for which they are responsible,\nand no single provider oversees all the steps in a patient's journey. True clinical process\nredesign and healthcare reform must recognize that “the patient is the only person who\nsees the whole journey's5.\nA nother method to collect data directly from patients that overcomes the fragmentation of\nThe patient journey is a visual tool used to understand how the patient encounters and\ninteracts with a series of consecutive healthcare services or events53. McCarthy et al.\n(2016) developed an integrated patient journey mapping tool that can be used to evaluate\nmanagement strategies for healthcare service reform53.\nEmployed for a slightly different purpose, Bolz-Johnson and colleagues (2020) used\npatient journey mapping as a way for patients to share their expertise and experience\nwhen studying a rare syndrome called “genturis syndromes*40. The genetic tumour risk\nsyndrome is difficult to diagnose and lacks effective preventative and therapeutic\ninterventions. Stages in their journey maps were based on inherent disease stages and the",

In addition, there is much variability in the presentation of symptoms.

This study consisted of\nindividual interviews, focus groups, and patient journey mapping that solicited the patient\nview of the economic, employment, social, emotional, and psychological impacts of\narrhythmias57. The study involved patients with various arrhythmia conditions not limited\nto AF. Patients with confirmed cardiac arrhythmias were asked to create a map of their\njourney and describe the effects of their arrhythmia from the onset of symptoms to\ntreatment and beyond. Trend lines were created to capture the changes in emotions, social\nrelationships, employment, and finances over the course of their journeys.",

Our goal was to develop a patient-reported questionnaire\nthat would capture these important missing concerns and apply this questionnaire to\nconfirm the qualitative findings and test hypotheses.\nChapter 3 summarizes the development of the Mapping the Impact of A trial Fibrillation\n(MA P-AF) questionnaire.

Furthermore,\nsome items were tied to a specific phase in the patient journey timeline: symptom-\nonset/pre-diagnosis phase, peri-diagnosis phase, or post-diagnosis phase. Other items\nasked about general concerns and current wellbeing. The print version of the preliminary\n35-item MA P-AF is available in Appendix A.\nThe relevance and wording of the items were discussed with a patient-partner researcher\nand the final candidate items were reviewed by the committee members - including a\nmethodologist and a clinician.\nAll items utilized a 7-point Likert response scale. For items 16 to 21, the response options\nranged from “not at all bothered\" to “extremely bothered\"'; for the remaining items, the\nresponse options ranged from “strongly disagree’ to “strongly agree\". Except for the\nreverse coded items, a higher position on the scale reflects a greater experienced impact\nor a more negative patient experience.\nDue to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the preliminary 35-item\nMA P-AF was administered via an online survey platform - Qualtrics.

Four items (3, 5, 23, and 25)\n had a large absolute skewness or kurtosis statistic, indicating departure from normality.\nItem 25 was the most severely skewed, with a skewness of 2.5 and a kurtosis of 6.8.

A priori hypotheses related to the factor scores are tested, and a\nmultivariable linear regression is run on the overall score to identify significant\npredictors.\n4.1 Methods\n4.1.1 Factor scores\nThe MAP-AF has five factors underlying 16 items: “Affect\" and “Social Support’ each\n“\"Diagnostic Experience” has two. The complete factor structure, including the specific\nitems, can be found in Table 9 of Chapter 3.\nThe N/A options available for items 19, 33, and 34 from “Financial Impact\" and item 21\nfrom “Major Life Events” complicate factor score computation, along with missing\nvalues.\nWe first referred to the item-total correlations of the four items presented in Table 9 of\nChapter 3. A low standardized item-total correlation and a high standardized alpha-if-\nfactor. When examining “Financial Impact\", item 19 had the lowest item-total\ncorrelation, and when deleted, may increase the overall Cronbach's alpha from 0.81 to\n0.89. On the other hand, deleting either items 33 or 34 will reduce the overall Cronbach's\nalpha significantly to the 0.6 range. Therefore, individuals selecting N/A or missing item\nEvents\", item 21 (with the N/A option) had the highest item-total correlation and, if\ndeleted, would reduce the overall Cronbach's alpha from 0.68 to 0.54.

The linear and monotonic relationships\nbetween age and the overall score were examined using the Pearson product-moment\ncorrelation and the Spearman rank-order correlation, respectively. The non-parametric\nWilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann-Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon-\nMann-W hitney test) was used to assess gender differences in the overall score.

Patients residing in rural areas incurred\nhigher transportation costs and lost potential income when they had to miss work and\nand friends were the most supportive proximally before and after patients were\ndiagnosed. During this time, many patients withdrew socially from family and friends\ndue to feelings of embarrassment and guilt.

    "Page_68": "56\nBackward selection begins with a full model and deletes variables with the least\nsignificant F statistic one at a time until all variables in the model have F statistics at a\nspecified stay significance level*. Vittinghoff and colleagues (2012) suggest a liberal\ncriterion for deletion, removing only variables with p-values greater or equal to 0.29.\nEach deletion (or addition, in forward selection) produces a new model, resulting in a\nsequence of models once variable movement halts. Either the last model in the sequence\nor the model with the best fit statistics is usually selected. The R-square statistic is one of\nthe most common model fit statistics. An alternative tool for optimal model selection is\nAkaike's information criterion (AIC). The AIC measures the difference between a given\nmodel and the “true” underlying model and is a function of sample size, sum of squared\nerrors, and the number of parametersf°. It was shown to be superior for selecting the most\noptimal model in statistical regression10.\nA major limitation of both forward and stepwise selection methods is that they begin with\na null model. The full model (with all predictors) may never emerge unless all candidate\npredictors are deemed significant. To that end, Vittinghoff et al. (2012) recommend using\nbackward selection primarily and the other two methods for sensitivity analyses9.\nTo select demographic and clinical covariates for the overall MA P-AF score, we used\nmodels produced from the sequential deletion of variables, the model with the smallest\nAICwasselected.\nSensitivity analyses were carried out to compare results obtained from backward\nselection (stay significance level = 0.20), forward selection (entry significance level =\n0.50), and stepwise selection (entry significance level = 0.20 and stay significance level =\n0.20).\nMissing values were excluded by list-wise deletion\n4.1.5  Multivariable linear regression\nBased on the results of statistical regression, the final linear regression model for the\noverall score included age (and age-squared), gender, marital status, educational",

The adjusted\nFits (DFFITS) was used to detect influential observations. The DFFITS statistic for an\nobservation quantifies the change in predicted values when that observation is deleted12.\nWe explored the robustness of the parameter estimates to potentially influential\nobservations by deleting observations with the largest DFFITS five at a time\n4.1.7  Additional models\nUsing the same five predictors included in the main linear regression model, we ran five\nadditional models for the five factor scores.\nThe factor scores were rescaled to range from 0 to 100 for better interpretability.\nSignificant findings are briefly summarized in the results section\n4.2Results\n4.2.1  Descriptive analysis\nsummarized in Table 11.

These include\nresults from questionnaire development (Chapter 3) and analyses of the questionnaire\nscores (Chapter 4). We will also discuss the implications of the results, the strengths, anc\nthe limitations of this thesis. We conclude with suggestions for future research.\n5.1 Summary of results\nThis thesis was built upon previous qualitative research. From focus groups with\nrelationships, livelihood, and finances. Existing (HR)QoL questionnaires do not\nchanges before and after treatment. Therefore, their primary focus is on physical\nfunctioning, symptoms, ability to perform daily activities, and affect. This led to our\nproposal to develop a new questionnaire to comprehensively understand the effects of AF\nalong the patient journey - covering broader life impacts and challenges surrounding\ndiagnosis (a central theme of the A F patient experience).\n 5.1.1  Results of questionnaire development\n5.1.1.1 Construct of interest\nsymptoms, and psychological wellbeing over a four-week period. V alidated ones are\nsuitable for evaluating the effects of interventions during the treatment phase. Beyond\nthis need to evaluate treatment efficacy, there is little interest in understanding QoL\nduring symptom onset and how the disease affects multiple aspects of patients?\nwellbeing. This is where the MA P-AF differs from existing instruments as a patient-\nreported measure that addresses these gaps and recognizes the dynamics of the patient\njourney. The most prominent concerns of patients fluctuate over the clinical course of\nAF.",
    "Page_91": "79\nWhile the MA P-AF can be considered a measure of patient outcomes, one domain\n(\"Diagnostic Experience\") is dedicated to measuring patients’ experiences with medical\ncare. The international PaRIS survey, developed for patients with chronic conditions\nsimilarly measures both important outcomes and experiences of health care in one\ninstrument'.\ntypically considered non-health-related. Although non-health-related aspects of wellbeing\nare less likely to change due to medical interventions, they are nevertheless affected by\ndisease and experienced by patients. The LupusPRO questionnaire developed by Jolly et\nal. (2012) measures both health-related and non-health-related aspects of QoL of\nhelps researchers and clinicians gain insight into patient needs and improve healthcare\nservices².\n5.1.1.2  Factor structure and internal consistency\nAfter exploratory factor analysis and item reduction, the MA P-AF questionnaire had 16\nitems and five domains: “Affect\", “Social Support\", “Financial Impact\", “Major Life\nEvents\", and “Diagnostic Experience\". Considering we did not have a priori hypotheses\nabout the number of factors underlying the items, the factor solution came out\nunexpectedly clean. Results of EFA can often be quite messy, conflicting, and difficult to\ninterpret, especially when sample sizes are small and loadings are weak3.\nW hen the threshold factor loading was set to 0.35, there were very few cross-loading\nitems: two in the 5-factor solution, one in the 6-factor solution, and none in the 7-factor\nsolution. Furthermore, the same factor solutions emerged even under different data\nconditions. The rotated factorloadings were robust to the factor extraction methods (ULS\nvs. iPAF), rotation methods (promax vs. direct oblimin), missing value imputation (CCA\nvs. EM), and log transformation of one skewed item (i.e., item 25). Based on parsimony\nand interpretability, the 6-factor structure was initially chosen as the solution for further\nscrutiny using measurement properties like the item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha.\nand inter-factor correlation.",
    "Page_92": "80\nThe final MA P-AF had five domains because one factor (original factor 6) was deemed\nproblematic. The three items in the factor were difficult to interpret (i.e., does not appear\nto reflect one unifying concept) and had low item-total correlations. The factor itself had\npoor internal consistency (0.70 to 0.95 considered good internal consistency)4 and a low\ncorrelation with the other five factors. We also failed to redistribute the three items to the\nother established factors, ultimately resulting in our decision to remove the items from\nthe final questionnaire.\nFor the remaining five factors, all except for “Major Life Events\" had good internal\nconsistency. The \"Major Life Events” factor had a borderline Cronbach's alpha of O.68\nDespite having only two items, the “Diagnostic Experience” factor was stable and had a\nhigh alpha of 0.78.\nThe result of EFA is sample-dependent, and one of the sample characteristics that may\naffect EFA results is where patients are on the patient journey. Our study recruited\npatients who had a pulmonary vein ablation - most patients in our sample identified\nthemselves to be in the treatment and beyond phase, and many were “cured\".\nWhile our post-PVA sample provided us with an overview of the patient journey, we\nrecognize that the factor loadings and the factor structure of the MA P-AF may be\ndifferent had we used a different patient sample. For example, if we administered the 35-\nitem MA P-AF to a sample of recently diagnosed patients, the factor structure we obtain\nmay be quite different.\n5.1.2  Results of questionnaire scores\n5.1.2.1  Descriptive analyses of questionnaire scores\nhad mean scores less than 3 on a 7-point Likert scale. “Affect\" had a mean score of 3.76,\nand \"Major Life Events” had the highest mean score of 4.12. The result is likely a\nconsequence of a sample composed of mostly “cured” patients who no longer experience\nepisodes and symptoms of AF. Over 80% of our patients were diagnosed more than three",

By recruiting PVA patients, we would reduce the inclusion of\nsuited for answering diagnosis-related questions). Unfortunately, we were unable to\nexclude all incidentally diagnosed individuals with this eligibility criteria. From patient\ncomments, we found that several were diagnosed when presented to the emergency\ndepartment for other reasons or during routine physical examinations. The inclusion of\nhave selected “strongly disagree” for the items when in reality, the most suitable response\nwas “non-applicable\".\n5.1.2.2  Multivariable linear regression of the overall score\nThe total score on the MA P-AF reflects the extent to which patients have been affected\nby A F across all domains. Multivariable linear regression found age, marital status,\neducational attainment, and time of last AF episode to be associated with the overall\nscore. Generally, patients were more impacted by AF if they were younger, divorced or\nseparated, had lower education, or experienced more recent episodes of AF. Randolph et\nal. (2016) conducted similar analyses using the A trial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of\nLife (AFEQT) scale and found female sex, younger age, new-onset AF, higher heart rate\nand the presence of comorbidities to be significantly associated with a reduced QoL5.\nA nother study also found sex differences in QoL improvements over time, in which\nfemale patients showed less improvement in A FEQT scores over 1 year than male\npatients6.\nBased on previous literature that found women to be more symptomatic yet less likely to\nbe offered an ablation, we hypothesized that there would be gender differences in the A F",
    "Page_94": "82\nimpact?8. Contrary to our expectations and different from other QoL studies, gender was\nnot significantly correlated with the overall score in this study. Nevertheless, when time\nof last A F episode was tentatively excluded from the model, the effect of gender became\nsignificant (p-value went from 0.18 to 0.036). The qualitative conclusions for the other\ncovariates remained the same. We speculate that the effect of gender on A F impact was\nlikely confounded by disease severity and disease burden. Presumably, female patients\nseverity was accounted for using the variable “time of last episode\", gender was no\nlonger significant.\nThe four variables (age, marital status, educational attainment, and time of last AF\nepisode) explained 20.4% of the variance of the overall score. The remaining unexplained\nvariance could be attributed to comorbidities, treatment effectiveness, and other AF\ncharacteristics. Future studies should include valid and accurate measurements of the\nabove variables (e.g., using validated scales to assess A F symptom severity).\n5.1.2.3P redictors\nThis section discusses the relationships between selected predictors and the five MA P-A F\ndomains based on the additional analyses.\nFirst, our results supported previous research that found women to have a more difficult\nfemales than males after adjusting for all covariates. Several patients also provided\npersonal anecdotes in the comments describing how a few physicians they encountered\nwere dismissive of their symptoms and concerns, which in many cases delayed their\nin shaping the patient experience.\nSecond, divorced or separated patients had the highest scores on all five domains\ncompared to other marital statuses. Married patients were least impacted by AF; widowed\nor single patients consistently did better than divorced or separated patients. A study",

The MA P-AF\nquestionnaire that assesses the impact of AF on the lives of Canadian patients was\ndeveloped based on focus groups and interviews conducted across Canadian provinces.\nTwo other PROMs developed in Canada are the University of Toronto A trial Fibrillation\nSymptom Severity scale (AFSS) and the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life\n(AFEQT). The AFEQT is a HRQoL questionnaire developed in both the US and Canada\nthat assesses AF symptoms, patients’ ability to perform daily activities, treatment\nconcerns, and treatment satisfaction. It has been used in clinical trials to measure QoI\nchanges due to interventions10.11,12. The MA P-AF questionnaire is unlike typical HRQoL\nmeasures, as patient experiences and the impact of AF on broader realms of wellbeing\nwere measured. Our construct of interest is most similar to the Organisation for\npatients, where both patient experiences and patient outcomes are measured in one\ninstrument'. Despite nuances in the construct measured, the AF impact that we assessed\nshares similar predictors with (HR)QoL.\nOur study demonstrated a statistically significant gender bias in A F diagnoses. Previous\nreports of this phenomenon were from qualitative interviews13, and we were able to\nsupport this observation with quantitative evidence.

The\nliterature consistently reports women to experience greater symptom severity and\nfrequency7°, yet they are more likely than men to experience difficulties and delays in\ndiagnosis and treatment. One of the potential reasons for this observation is the perceived",

A study found that women experiencing syncope, one\nof the possible symptoms of AF, were often dismissed by Emergency Medical Services\nas a symptom of feminine conditions like menstruation, menopause, or pregnancy14.\nFurther investigation into the factors contributing to gender differences in the patient\nexperience is warranted to achieve equitable and effective healthcare services.\n5.3Strengths and limitations\nThis study has several strengths, including the performance of sensitivity analyses\nadditional exploratory analyses, collecting patient feedback on the questionnaire, high\nFirst, the results of exploratory factor analysis were robust to various data conditions. By\nperforming sensitivity analyses, we were able to see whether conclusions would change\nunder varying circumstances and justify our decisions.\nA lthough the MA P-AF still needs to undergo extensive validation before its scores can be\nmeaningfully analyzed, we conducted many additional analyses that functioned to\ngenerate hypotheses for future research.\nThe textbox included at the end of the online questionnaire also generated lots of\nqualitative data. While we did not conduct a formal analysis of the data, the comments\nprovided by patients helped inform some of the limitations and future directions of our\nstudy.\nThe MA P-AF questionnaires had a high completion rate of 87% and few missing data\nWe show that web administration of surveys is feasible in our age demographic, which\nhad a mean of 63.8 years and a max of 83 years. The skip patterns, N/A options, and the\ncomment box features allowed us to categorize and better understand missing data.\nA thorough investigation of missing values was done for the 24 items prior to EFA\n(eleven highly irrelevant items were removed). Of 277 who took the questionnaire, 14\n(5.1%) individuals did not answer at least one of the 24 items. Patients’ feedback",

Some patients\nindicated that they did not experience symptoms before they were diagnosed, rendering\nthem unable to answer the diagnosis-related questions. There were only four questions\namong the 24 items with a N/A option. There were no missing values for these four items\n- missing values only occurred where the N/A option was not available. Three of the 14\nindividuals with missing values have used the N/A option at least once. We speculate that\nif a N/A option existed for the items they missed, they would have selected it instead. For\nthe remaining 11 individuals, the possible reasons for missingness were provided in the\nresults. Briefly, these include suboptimal question wording, the nearby presence of family\nmembers, forgetfulness, and again, the lack of a N/A option when the question did not\napply.\nThere are also limitations to this study. These include sample selection, possible recall\nbias, suboptimal design of clinical questions, lack of consideration for comorbidities, and\nthe effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic on social-related questions\nanother 30% diagnosed more than 3 years ago.

We thought these patients would have responded to the above questions with\n\"less than one episode a year\"', \"last episode was more than 1 year ago\", and \"minimal to\nno symptoms as of recently\"'. However, we found the questions to be suboptimally\nworded, such that some patients responded in a way that reflected their past AF burden\nwhen they still had AF. We thus anticipate some misclassification to be present and a\nquestion that clarifies whether respondents are still in atrial fibrillation or not may\nremedy this problem. Respondents could then be directed to questions appropriate to\nthem. Alternatively, validated symptom scales could be used to capture the clinical\nprofile of our patients more accurately.\ncomorbidities that made it difficult to attribute their reduced wellbeing to a particular\nsource like A F.

Comorbidities likely explain a portion of the variance in the MA P-AF scores, but\nthey were not measured in this study.\nQuestionnaire data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic when lockdowns and\nsocial distancing were imposed. The focus groups and patient journey mapping were\nconducted during pre-pandemic times. The pandemic may have skewed responses to\nquestions about patients' social relationships and social life satisfaction. Some, not all,\npatients answered as if the pandemic did not exist (i.e., what life would be like in pre-\npandemic times).",

Many patients mentioned the long waitlist for an\nablation - a patient described geting cardioverted seven times while waiting for an\nof some patients deteriorated, and many were unable to pursue their desired lifestyle. The\ndifficulty of getting an ablation, an appointment, or a referral can greatly delay treatment\npatients expressed that the empathetic and compassionate care they received outweighed\nany costs or inconveniences associated with their condition and treatment. This further\nreinforces the importance of considering both experiences with practical aspects of care\n(i.e., patient experiences) and effects of care (i.e., patient outcomes).\nSecond, patients described additional effects of AF that were not outlined in the MA P-\nAF. These included the effect of AF on their sleep and their fulfillment of their sexual\nlives. Most frequently mentioned was the inability to perform their desired level of\nphysical activity. This significantly affected the patient's health, autonomy (e.g., unable",
    "Page_100": "88\nto drive a car and go shopping alone), and social life. Even for patients who had a\nsuccessful ablation and were able to return to an active lifestyle, they worried about\nwhether A F would return due to them being active again.\nIn general, there was considerable uncertainty surrounding AF, which produced anxiety\nfor many patients.\n5.5 Conclusion and future directions\nThe MA P-AF questionnaire was developed and initially validated in a sample of post\npulmonary vein ablation patients with AF in London, Ontario. The questionnaire contains\nlower education, and experiencing more recent episodes were associated with a more\nnegative patient journey. While the effect of gender on overall A F impact appears to be\nconfounded by the time of last AF episode, gender was nevertheless an important\npredictor for the patient's diagnostic experience. Confirming previous qualitative\nfindings, female patients were more likely to have their symptoms dismissed and report\nhaving a more difficult time trying to get a diagnosis than male patients. Healthcare\nprofessionals should increase their awareness of the challenges associated with symptom\nonset and their own affective responses to patients presenting with palpitations and other\nA F symptoms. Timely diagnosis and treatment initiation are goals shared by both patients\nand physicians.\noutcomes of care.
