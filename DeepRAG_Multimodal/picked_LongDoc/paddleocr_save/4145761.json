In this chapter you will learn how to connect Linux, macOs, Windows, and mobile devices to your\nNextcloud server via WebDAV. Before we get into configuring WebDAV, let's take a quick look at the recommended\nway of connecting client devices to your Nextcloud servers.\nNote: In the following examples, you should replace example.com/nextcloud with the URL of your Nextcloud\nserver (omit the directory part if the installation is in the root of your domain), and *“USERNAME' with the username\n of the connecting user.\nSee the WebDAV URL (bottom left in settings) on your Nextcloud.\n4.2. Accessing Nextcloud files using WebDAV\n17",
    "Page_22": "Nextcloud User Manual, Release latest\nNote: In the following examples, you must use an app-password for login, which you can generate in your security\nsettings.\n4.2.1 Nextcloud Desktop and mobile clients\nThe recommended way to synchronize a desktop PC with a Nextcloud server is by using Nextcloud/ownCloud sync\nclients. You can configure the client to save files in any local directory and you can choose which directories on the\nNextcloud server to sync with. The client displays the current connection status and logs all activity, so you always\nknow which remote files have been downloaded to your PC and you can verify that files created and updated on your\nlocal PC are properly synchronized with the server.\nThe recommended way to synchronize Nextcloud server with Android and Apple iOS devices is by using the mobile\napps.\nTo connect your mobile app to a Nextcloud server use the base URL and folder only:\nexample.com/nextcloud\n In addition to the mobile apps provided by Nextcloud or ownCloud, you can use other apps to connect to Nextcloud\nfrom your mobile device using WebDAV. WebDAV Navigator is a good (proprietary) app for Android devices and\niPhones. The URL to use on these is:\nexample.com/nextcloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/\n4.2.2 WebDAV configuration\nIf you prefer, you may also connect your desktop PC to your Nextcloud server by using the WebDAV protocol rather\nthan using a special client application. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is a Hypertext Transfer\nProtocol (HTTP) extension that makes it easy to create, read, and edit files on Web servers. With WebDAV you can\n access your Nextcloud shares on Linux, macOS and Windows in the same way as any remote network share, and stay\nsynchronized.\n4.2.3 Accessing files using Linux\nYou can access files in Linux operating systems using the following methods.\nNautilus file manager\nWhen you configure your Nextcloud account in the GNOME Control Center, your files will automatically be\n mounted by Nautilus as a WebDAV share, unless you deselect file access.\nYou can also mount your Nextcloud files manually. Use the davs : / / protocol to connect the Nautilus fle manager\nto your Nextcloud share:\ndavs:/ /example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/\nNote: If your server connection is not HTTPS-secured, use dav : / / instead of davs : / /:\n18\nChapter 4.

This is useful if you prefer to access Nextcloud the\nsame way as any other remote filesystem mount. The following example shows how to create a personal mount and\n1. Install the davf s 2 WebDAV filesystem driver, which allows you to mount WebDAV shares just like any other\nremote filesystem. Use this command to install it on Debian/Ubuntu:\napt-get install davfs2\n2. Use this command to install it on CentOs, Fedora, and openSUSE:\nyum install davfs2\n 3. Add yourself to the davfs2 group:\nusermod -aG davfs2 <username>\npersonal configuration file:\nmkdir ~/nextcloud\nmkdir ~/.davfs2\n4. Copy /etc/davfs2/secrets to ~ / .davfs2:\n cp /etc/davfs2/secrets ~/.davfs2/secrets\n5. Set yourself as the owner and make the permissions read-write owner only:\nchown <linux_username>:<linux_username> ~/.davfs2/secrets\nchmod 600 ~/.davfs2/secrets\n6. Add your Nextcloud login credentials to the end of the seCret s fle, using your Nextcloud server URL and\nyour Nextcloud username and password:\nhttps://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/ <username> <password>\nor\n$PathToMountPoint $USERNAME $PASSWORD\n20\nChapter 4.

It is not\npermanently deleted until you manually delete it, or when the Deleted Files app deletes it to make room for new files.\nFind your deleted files by clicking on the Deleted files button on the Files page of the Nextcloud Web interface. You'll\nhave options to either restore or permanently delete files.\n4.3.1 Quotas\n Deleted fles are not counted against your storage quota. Only your personal files count against your quota, not files\nwhich were shared with you. (See Storage quota to learn more about quotas.)\n4.3.2 What happens when shared files are deleted\n Deleting files gets a little complicated when they are shared files, as this scenario illustrates:\n1. User1 shares a folder “\"test\" with User2 and User3\n2. User2 (the recipient) deletes a file/folder “sub\" inside of “\"test\"\n3. The folder “sub\" will be moved to the trash bin of both Userl (owner) and User2 (recipient)\n4. But User3 will not have a copy of “sub\" in their trash bin\nWhen User1 deletes “sub\" then it is moved to User1's trash bin. It is deleted from User2 and User3, but not placed in\ntheir trash bins.\nWhen you share files, other users may copy, rename, move, and share them with other people, just as they can for any\ncomputer files; Nextcloud does not have magic powers to prevent this.\n4.3.3 How the deleted files app manages storage space\ncurrently available free space to deleted files. If your deleted files exceed this limit, Nextcloud deletes the oldest files\n(files with the oldest timestamps from when they were deleted) until it meets the memory usage limit again.\nNextcloud checks the age of deleted files every time new files are added to the deleted files. By default,\nthe config.php file by setting the trashbin_retention_obligation value. Files older than the\nt rashbin_retent ion_obligation value will be deleted permanently. Additionally, Nextcloud calculates\nthe maximum available space every time a new file is added. If the deleted files exceed the new maximum allowed\n28\nChapter 4. Files & synchronization",
    "Page_33": "Nextcloud User Manual, Release latest\nspace Nextcloud will permanently delete those trashed files with the soonest expiration until the space limit is met\nagain.\nment. See admin documentation for more details.\n4.4 Desktop and mobile synchronization\n For synchronizing fles with your desktop computer, we recommend using the Nextcloud Sync Client for Windows,\nmacOS and Linux.\nThe Nextcloud Desktop Sync Client enables you to connect to your Nextcloud Server. You can create folders in your\nhome directory, and keep the contents of those folders synced with your Nextcloud server. Simply copy a file into\nthe directory and the Nextcloud desktop client does the rest. Make a change to the files on one computer, it will flow\nacross the others using these desktop sync clients. You will always have your latest fles with you wherever you are.\nIts usage is documented separately in the Nextcloud Desktop Client Manual.\n4.4.1 Mobile clients\nVisit your Personal page in your Nextcloud Web interface to find download links for Android and iOS mobile sync\nclients. Or, visit the Nextcloud download page.\n4.5 Encrypting your Nextcloud files on the server\nNextcloud includes a server side Encryption app, and when it is enabled by your Nextcloud administrator all of your\nNextcloud data files are automatically encrypted on the server. Encryption is server-wide, so when it is enabled you\ncannot choose to keep your files unencrypted. You don't have to do anything special, as it uses your Nextcloud login\n s s o s    no p n  s   d  o e asd  s\nIts main purpose is to encrypt files on remote storage services that are connected to your Nextcloud server. This is an\neasy and seamless way to protect your files on remote storage. You can share your remote fles through Nextcloud in\n the usual way, however you cannot share your encrypted fles directly from the remote service you are using, because\n the encryption keys are stored on your Nextcloud server, and are never exposed to outside service providers.\nIf your Nextcloud server is not connected to any remote storage services, then it is better to use some other form\nof encryption such as file-level or whole disk encryption. Because the keys are kept on your Nextcloud server, it is\n possible for your Nextcloud admin to snoop in your files, and if the server is compromised the intruder may get access\nto your files. (Read Encryption in Nextcloud to learn more.)\n4.5.1 Encryption FAQ\nHow can encryption be disabled?\nThe only way to disable encryption is to run the “decrypt all’ script, which decrypts all files and disables encryption\n4.4. Desktop and mobile synchronization\n29",
    "Page_34": "Nextcloud User Manual, Release latest\nYes, if every user uses the file recovery key, “\"decrypt al' will use it to decrypt all files.\nCan encryption be disabled without the user's password?\nIf you don't have the users password or file recovery key, then there is no way to decrypt all files. What's more,\nrunning it on login would be dangerous, because you would most likely run into timeouts.\nIs it planned to move this to the next user login or a background job?\n If we did that, then we would need to store your login password in the database. This could be seen as a security issue,\nso nothing like that is planned.\nIs group Sharing possible with the recovery key?\n If you mean adding users to groups and make it magically work? No. This only works with the master key.\n4.5.2 Using encryption\n Nextcloud encryption is pretty much set it and forget it, but you have a few options you can use.\nWhen your Nextcloud admin enables encryption for the first time, you must log out and then log back in to create your\nencryption keys and encrypt your files. When encryption has been enabled on your Nextcloud server you will see a\nyellow banner on your Files page warning you to log out and then log back in:\nWhen you log back in it takes a few minutes to work, depending on how many files you have, and then you are returned\n to your default Nextcloud page.\nInitial encryption started...This can\ntake some time. Please wait.\n stashcat\nLog in\n30\nChapter 4. Files & synchronization",
    "Page_35": "Nextcloud User Manual, Release latest\nNote: You must never lose your Nextcloud password, because you will lose access to your files. Though there is\nan optional recovery option that your Nextcloud administrator may enable; see the Recovery Key Password section\n(below) to learn about this.\n4.5.3 Sharing encrypted files\nOnly users who have private encryption keys have access to shared encrypted files and folders. Users who have not yet\ncreated their private encryption keys will not have access to encrypted shared files; they will see folders and filenames,\nbut will not be able to open or download the files. They will see a yellow warning banner that says “Encryption App\nis enabled but your keys are not initialized, please log-out and log-in again.\"\nShare owners may need to re-share files after encryption is enabled; users trying to access the share will see a message\nadvising them to ask the share owner to re-share the file with them. For individual shares, un-share and re-share the\nthe share owner can remove the individual shares.\nRecovery key password\n If your Nextcloud administrator has enabled the recovery key feature, you can choose to use this feature for your\naccount. If you enable “Password recovery” the administrator can read your data with a special password. This feature\nenables the administrator to recover your files in the event you lose your Nextcloud password. If the recovery key is\nnot enabled, then there is no way to restore your files if you lose your login password.\nEncryption\nEnable recovery key (allow to recover users files in case of password loss):\nRecovery key password\nRepeatRecoverykeypassword\nEnabled\n Disabled\n4.5.4 Files not encrypted\n· Old files in the trash bin.\n· Image thumbnails from the Gallery app.\n· Previews from the Files app.\n· The search index from the full text search app.\n· Third-party app data\n4.5.

This can occur if your Nextcloud provider uses an external user back-end (for example, LDAP) and changed\nyour login password using that back-end configuration. In this case, you can set your encryption password to your new\nlogin password by providing your old and new login password. The Encryption app works only if your login password\nand your encryption password are identical.\n4.6 File Sharing\n· public links\n· users\n· groups\n· circles\n· talk conversations\n· users or groups on federated Nextcloud servers\nNote: Some options may not be available due to administrative configuration.

Some apps store information in the database, such as the Calendar and Contacts apps.\nThis data is excluded from your quota.\nWhen other users share files with you, the shared files count against the original share owner's quota. When you share\na folder and allow other users or groups to upload files to it, all uploaded and edited files count against your quota.\nWhen you re-share files shared with you, the re-share still counts against the quota of the original share owner.\nEncrypted files are a little larger than unencrypted files; the unencrypted size is calculated against your quota.\nDeleted files that are still in the trash bin do not count against quotas. The trash bin is set at 50% of quota. Deleted\nfile aging is set at 30 days. When deleted files exceed 50% of quota then the oldest files are removed until the total is\nbelow50%.\nNote: Your administrator may have configured the trash bin retention period to override the storage space manage-\nment.

    "Page_123": "CHAPTER 9\nUsing two-factor authentication\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is a way to protect your Nextcloud account against unauthorized access. It works by\nrequiring two different ‘proofs’ of your identity. For example, something you know (like a password) and something\nyou have like a physical key. Typically, the first factor is a password like you already have and the second can be a\ntext message you receive or a code you generate on your phone or another device (something you have). Nextcloud\nsupports a variety of 2nd factors and more can be added.\nOnce a two-factor authentication app has been enabled by your administrator you can enable and configure it in Setting\nyour preferences. Below you can see how.\n9.1 Configuring two-factor authentication\n In your Personal Setings look up the Second-factor Auth setting. In this example this is TOTP, a Google Authenticator\ncompatible time-based code:\n You will see your secret and a QR code which can be scanned by the TOTP app on your phone (or another device).\nDepending on the app or tool, type in the code or scan the QR and your device will show a login code which changes\nevery 30 seconds.\n9.2 Recovery codes in case you lost your 2nd factor\n You should always generate backup codes for 2FA. If your 2nd factor device gets stolen or is not working, you will\nbe able to use one of these codes to unlock your account. It effectively functions as a backup 2nd factor. To get the\nbackup codes, go to your Personal Settings and look under Second-factor Auth settings. Choose Generate backup\ncodes:\nYou will then be presented with a list of one-time-use backup codes:\nYou should put these codes in a safe spot, somewhere you can find them. Don't put them together with your 2nd factor\nlike your mobile phone but make sure that if you lose one, you still have the other. Keeping them at home is probably\nthe best thing to do.\n119",

To solve this, you should generate device specific passwords for them. See\nManage connected browsers and devices for more information on how to do this.\n9.6 Considerations\nIf you use WebAuthn to login to your Nextcloud be sure to not use the same token for 2FA.
