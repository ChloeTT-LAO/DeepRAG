In spite of its importance, the mass\nbalance (the net volumetric gain or loss) of the Antarctic ice sheet is poorly known; it is not known\nexactly whether the ice sheet is growing or shrinking. Changes in the area and volume of the polar\nice sheets are strictly linked to global changes and could result in sea-level variation that would\nseverely affect the densely populated coastal regions on the Earth.\nVelocity of ice-streams is a critical parameter, which, together with ice thickness, allows the\ndetermination of ice discharge rates; this information is however in large part not available, or only\npartially available for the last years, and can be mainly provided by using remote sensing\ntechnologies and techniques.\nAntarctica is the only continent which has still to be fully explored [144]. Because of its\ngeographical position and physical characteristics, together with the distance from sources of\npollution and the almost total absence of anthropic disturbance, Antarctica provides us with a\nunique opportunity to obtain data for a global knowledge of the planet [144]. Antarctica is perhaps\nthe continent in which the nations respond more freely to the need for common research\nprogrammes. A Treaty was signed in Washington on December 1st 1959 by the 12 countries\nparticipating in the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958); the Treaty covers the area south of\n60°S latitude. Its objectives are simple yet unique in international relations, being:\n    sn        s     -\n radioactive waste, and to ensure that it is used for peaceful purposes only;\n- to promote international scientific cooperation in Antarctica;\n- to set aside disputes over territorial sovereignty.\nThe Antarctic Treaty remains in force indefinitely. The success of the Treaty has been the growth in\nmembership. Forty six countries, comprising around 80% of the world's population, have acceded\nto it. Consultative (voting) status is open to all countries who have demonstrated their commitment\nto the Antarctic by conducting significant research.\nIn the context of the research in Antarctica, Italian contribution is developed by the Italian National\nAntarctic Research Programme (Programma Nazionale di Ricerca in Antartide, PNRA), active\nsince 1985 with an expedition every year. The research Programme includes many disciplines:\nEarth Sciences, Atmosphere Physics, Cosmology, Biology and Medicine, Oceanography,\nEnvironmental Sciences, Technology. During its development, the Programme increasingly\n addressed the study of global phenomena inside the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the geosphere.\nPNRA has its main base at Mario Zucchelli Station in Terra Nova Bay, lying between Cape\ns     eo ns    n    \nfacilities allow there the execution of activities in the main research fields and in the framework of\nmajor international projects. Other important research activities are carried out at the Concordia\nStation, recently completed in collaboration with France, built 3233 m above sea level at a location\ncalled Dome C on the Antarctic Plateau; Concordia Station is located 12o0 kilometres inland from\nMario Zucchelli Station. This site was chosen by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica\n(EPICA) for deep ice core drilling, with the aim to obtain the longest undisturbed chronicle of\nenvironmental change, in order to characterise climate variability over several glacial cycles.\nDrilling was completed in December 2004, reaching a drilling depth of 3270.2 m; the core goes\nback 740oo0 years and reveals 8 previous glacial cycles.\n1",

Since the first International Polar\nYear in 1882-83 there have been a number of major international science initiatives in Polar\nRegions and all have had a major influence in providing a better understanding of global processes\nin these areas. These initiatives have involved an intense period of interdisciplinary research,\nregions. As mentioned, a fundamental moment was the International Geophysical Year 1957-58,\ninvolving 80oo0 scientists from 67 countries: it produced new explorations and discoveries in many\nfields of research and changed in a fundamental manner how science was conducted in the polar\nregions. Fifty years on, technological developments such as growing availability of earth\nobservation satellites, autonomous vehicles and molecular biology techniques offer enormous\nopportunities for a further step in our understanding of polar systems.\nThe International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008, actually running from March 2007 to March 2009,\nis then an international programme of coordinated, interdisciplinary scientific research and\nobservations in the Earth's polar regions with the aim to:\n- explore new scientific frontiers;\n- deepen our understanding of polar processes and their global linkages;\nengineers and logistics experts;\n- capture the interest of schoolchildren, the public and decision-makers.\nFocus areas of IPY campaigns are Atmosphere, Ice, Land, Oceans, People, Space\nOne might ask what are or what will be the advantages of the research activities performed in\nS s          \noutcome of slow maturation and derives from the combination of results obtained by the various\ncountries in the various sectors of research.\nThe introduction of the Thesis focus on the Global Change problem and the linkage with ice flows\nbehaviour in polar regions.

    "Page_13": "Chapter 1\nIntroduction\nAlthough the Earth system is constantly changing, ozone depletion, increases in atmospheric\ngreenhouse gases, large-scale pollution and changing patterns of natural resource use demonstrate\nthat human activities are altering the Earth system at an accelerated pace. Awareness of this has led\nto an evolving international consensus on the importance of both increasing our scientific\nunderstanding of global change and linking scientific findings to policy decisions [139].\nClimate change is one of the most critical global challenges of our time. Recent events have\nemphatically demonstrated our growing vulnerability to climate change. Climate change impacts\nwill range from affecting agriculture, further endangering food security, sea-level rise and the\n accelerated erosion of coastal zones, increasing intensity of natural disasters, species extinction and\nthe spread of vector-borne diseases [145]. In recent usage, especially in the context of\nenvironmental policy, the term \"climate change\" often refers to changes in modern climate,\nconsequences of global warming phenomenon, that represents the increase in the average\ntemperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans in recent decades (Figure 1.1) and its\nprojected continuation (Figure 1.5) [129]. In common usage, the term refers to recent warming and\nimplies a human influence [50]. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC) uses the term \"climate change\" for human-caused change, and \"climate variability\" for \nother changes [111]. The term \"anthropogenic global warming\" is sometimes used when focusing\n on human-induced changes.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific body tasked to evaluate the\nrisk of climate change caused by human activity [129]. The panel was established in 1988 by the\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP), two organizations of the United Nations. IPCC concludes \"most of the observed increase \nin globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed\nincrease in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations\"[47] via the greenhouse effect (Figure\n1.2). The greenhouse effect is the process in which the emission of infrared radiation by the\natmosphere warms a planet's surface. The name comes from an incorrect analogy with the warming\n of air inside a greenhouse compared to the air outside the greenhouse [129]. The Earth's average\nsurface temperature of 15 °C is about 33 °C warmer than it would be without the greenhouse effect\n[48]. Understanding global warming requires understanding the changes in climate forcings that\nhave occurred since the industrial revolution. These include positive forcing from increased\ngreenhouse gases, negative forcing from increased sulphate aerosols and poorly constrained\nforcings from indirect aerosol feedbacks as well as minor contributions from solar variability and\nunderstanding of how aerosols interact with the atmosphere and limited knowledge of aerosol\nconcentrations during the pre-industrial period. Contrary to the impression given by Figure 1.3, it is\nnot possible to simply sum the radiative forcing contributions from all sources and obtain a total\nforcing. This is because different forcing terms can interact to either amplify or interfere with each\nother. For example, in the case of greenhouse gases, two different gases may share the same\nabsorption bands thus partially limiting their effectiveness when taken in combination. This is a\n1",

    "Page_15": "Figure 1.4 shows the variations in concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere during\nthe last 400 thousand years. Throughout most of the record, the largest changes can be related to\nglacial/interglacial cycles within the current ice age. Although the glacial cycles are most directly\ncaused by changes in the Earth's orbit (i.e. Milankovitch cycles), these changes also influence the\ncarbon cycle, which in turn feeds back into the glacial system. Since the Industrial Revolution, circa\n1800, the burning of fossil fuels has caused a dramatic increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, reaching\nlevels unprecedented in the last 400 thousand years. This increase has been implicated as a primary\ncause of global warming.\nNatural phenomena such as solar variation combined with volcanoes probably had a small warming\neffect from pre-industrial times to 1950 and a small cooling effect from 1950 onward [44][1]. These\nbasic conclusions have been endorsed by at least 30 scientific societies and academies of science\n[106], including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries\n   s s     ss   lal\n[81], the overwhelming majority of scientists working on climate change agree with the IPCC's\nmain conclusions [98][107].\nThe global average air temperature near the Earth's surface rose 0.74 ± 0.18°C (1.33 ± 0.32°F)\nduring the 100 years ending in 2005 [47]. Climate model projections summarized by the IPCC\nindicate that average global surface temperature will likely rise a further 1.1 to 6.4°C (2.0 to 11.5°F)\nduring the 21st century [47]. The range of values results from the use of differing scenarios of\nfuture greenhouse gas emissions as well as models with differing climate sensitivity\nAlthough most studies focus on the period up to 21oo, warming and sea level rise are expected to\ncontinue for more than a thousand years even if greenhouse gas levels are stabilized. The delay in\nreaching equilibrium is a result of the large heat capacity of the oceans [85]. Figure 1.5 shows a\nprojection of the geographic distribution of surface warming during the 21st century from Hadley\n Centre HadCM3 climate model [143]. As can be expected from their lower specific heat, continents\nwarm more rapidly than the oceans in the model with an average of 4.2°C to 2.5°C respectively.\nThe lowest predicted warming is 0.55°C south of South America, and the highest is 9.2°C in the\nArctic Ocean (points exceeding 8°C are plotted as black). This model is fairly homogeneous except\nfor strong warming around the Arctic Ocean related to melting sea ice and strong warming in South\nAmerica related predicted changes in the El Nino cycle, that is part of a interannual cycle called\nENSO (El Nino, Southern Oscillation) which occurs in the tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean (El\nNino is the warm part of this cycle. It occurs once every 3 to 7 years).\nIncreasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation, which leads to more precipitation [47].\nAs average global temperatures have risen, average global precipitation has also increased.\nAccording to the IPCC, the following precipitation trends have been observed:\n·Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900-2005, but has\nmostly declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically\nsignificant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have widely by\nregion and over time.\n· It has become significantly wetter in eastern parts of North and South America, northern\nEurope, and northern and central Asia, but drier in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern\nAfrica and parts of southern Asia.\n· Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by freshening of\nmid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in\nlow-latitude waters (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation).\n· There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas\nduring the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts\nespecially in the tropics and subtropics.\n3",

The World Meteorological Organization [16] and\nthe U.s. Environmental Protection.\nAgency [1io] have linked increasing extreme weather events to global warming, as have Hoyos él\nal. (2006), writing that the increasing number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes is directly linked to\nincreasing temperatures [45]. Similarly, Kerry Emmanuel in Nature writes that hurricane power\ndissipation is highly correlated with temperature, reflecting global warming. Hurricane modeling\nhas produced similar results, finding that hurricanes, simulated under warmer, high CO2 conditions,\nare more intense than under present-day conditions.\nThomas Knutson and Robert E.Tuleya of the NOAA stated in 2o04 that warming induced by\nVecchi and Soden find that wind shear, the increase of which acts to inhibit tropical cyclones, also\ntropical Atlantic and East Pacific associated with the deceleration of the Walker circulation, as well\nas decreases of wind shear in the western and central Pacific[114]. The study does not make claims\nabout the net effect on Atlantic and East Pacific hurricanes of the warming and moistening\natmospheres, and the model-projected increases in Atlantic wind shear [114].\nIncreasing global temperature will cause sea level to rise. Sea-level has risen about 130 metres (400\n                \nat 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr.[50] Since 1900 the level has risen at 1 to 2 mm/yr; since 1993 satellite\naltimetry from TOPEX/Poseidon indicates a rate of rise of 3.1 ± 0.7 mm yr-1 [15]. Church and\nWhite (2006) found a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th\ncentury rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 ±0.3 mm per yr and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of\n 0.013 ± 0.006 mm per year per yr. If this acceleration remains constant, then the 1990 to 2100 rise\nwould range from 280 to 340 mm,[15]\nFigure 1.7 shows the change in annually averaged sea level at 23 geologically stable tide gauge\nsites with long-term records as selected by Douglas (1997) [19]. The thick dark line is a three-year\nmoving average of the instrumental records. This data indicates a sea level rise of ~18.5 cm from\n1900-2000. Because of the limited geographic coverage of these records, it is not obvious whether\nthe apparent decadal fluctuations represent true variations in global sea level or merely variations\n across regions that are not resolved. For comparison, the recent annually averaged satellite altimetry\ndata [19] from TOPEX/Poseidon are shown in red.\nThese data indicate a somewhat higher rate of increase than tide gauge data, however the source of\nthis discrepancy is not obvious.\nChanges in global climate and sea level are intricately linked to changes in the area and volume of\npolar ice sheets [72].\nDuring the most recent glacial maximum, about 18,0o0 years ago, the total volume of ice was about\n2.5 times, and the total area about three times, their present values [28] with the consequence that\nsea level was about 125m below its present level [23].

Until about 1940,\nglaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed. Glacial retreat slowed and even reversed,\nin many cases, between 1950 and 1980 as a slight global cooling 0ccurred. However, since 1980 a\nsignificant global warming has led to glacier retreat becoming increasingly rapid and ubiquitous, so\nmuch so that some glaciers have disappeared altogether, and the existence of a great number of the\nremaining glaciers of the world is threatened. In locations such as the Andes of South America and\nHimalayas in Asia, the demise of glaciers in these regions will have potential impact on water\nsupplies. The retreat of mountain glaciers, notably in western North America, Asia, the Alps,\n n q s   eo sr sns p n   p s\nprovide qualitative evidence for the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century [5i][82].\nThe recent substantial retreat and an acceleration of the rate of retreat since 1995 of a number of\nkey outlet glaciers of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, may foreshadow a rise in sea\nlevel, having a potentially dramatic effect on coastal regions worldwide [129]. Other large-scale\nphenomena that may be associated with global climate change include the possible destabilization\nand disintegration of the Antarctic ice shelves unstable [86]. Dramatic calving events (breaking\naway of ice) have been monitored [91]. In particular, it has been suggested that the West Antarctic\nice sheet may be using satellite data. The Larsen ice shelf has been retreating since the 1940s,\n       a      \nprobably now irreversible [18] [102].\nThe respective communities have begun to communicate, linking their datasets to provide an\nimportant basis to assess ongoing climate and glacier change, and to develop realistic scenarios for\nfuture conditions and challenges in glacierised mountain regions [1o4]. Fluctuations of glaciers and\nice caps have been systematically observed and measured for more than a century in various parts\na  n s           \ndetection strategies of global climate-related observations [104].\nSince the beginning of the internationally-coordinated collection of information on glacier changes\nwas initiated in 1894 [33], various aspects have evolved in striking ways [104]:\n Accelerating glacier shrinkage at the century time scale is now clearly non-cyclic, therefore\nS s sd s, e  n n    \n As a consequence of the growing influence of human impact on the climate system\n(enhanced greenhouse effect), dramatic scenarios of projected changes including complete\n deglaciation of entire mountain ranges must be taken into consideration [39]; [84]; [123];\n Such future scenarios may be beyond the range of historical/Holocene variability and most\nlikely introduce dramatic consequences (i.e., extent and rate of glacier melt and\ndisequilibrium of glacier/ climate relationships) [104].\nThe comparison of modern glacier retreat with the Holocene glacier variations provides\nimportant background information for our understanding of natural trends of, and human\nimpacts on, climate change [104].\n A broad portion of the global community today recognizes glacier changes as a key\nindication of regional and global climate, and environment change [104];\n7",

As with snow cover, measurement of the\nsurface albedo is also important, since it gives the possibility of modelling the energy balance of a\n glacier.

As\nwell as its importance in indicating the total amount of ice, surface topography provides important\nclues about the internal structure and can reveal flow features and grounding lines [65].

The range of wavelengths generated by a thermally\nemitting body depends on the temperature. The dominant wavelength is approximately A/T, where\nT is the absolute temperature of the body and A is a constant with a value of about 0.o03 Km, so for\na body at a temperature of 273K (0°C) the dominant wavelength is around 11 μm. The distribution\nof energy over wavelengths falls very sharply for shorter wavelengths, but at longer wavelengths\nthe decrease is much more gradual. For this reason, thermally emitted radiation can be detected both\n        s     \n14 μm and 1cm is largely blocked by the atmosphere. Figure 2.1 summarizes the useful regions of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum for remote sensing and the transparency of the atmosphere [91].\nPassive remote sensing systems that detect reflected solar radiation are designed to measure the\nradiance, i.e., the amount of radiation reaching the sensor in a particular waveband. If the amount of\nradiation that is incident on the Earth's surface is known, the reflectance of the surface can be\ncalculated (this requires that the effects of the atmosphere should be corrected). This can be said to\nbe the primary variable that is measured by such systems [91].\nprofilers, while radio-frequency radiation is used by radar altimeters, impulse radar, and similar\nsystems [9i]. The second type of active system is, similarly to the passive reflective systems,\nprimarily designed to measure the surface reflectance. However, instead of relying on incident solar\nradiation, the instrument illuminates the Earth's surface and analyzes the signal returned to it [91].\nThis gives the possibility of much greater flexibility in the characteristics of the radiation its\ndirection, wavelength, polarization, and time-structure (for example, it can be pulsed) can all be\ncontrolled [91]. Systems that employ this approach can generally be classed as imaging radars,\nsince they operate in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The primary variable\nmeasured in this case is the backscattering coefficient, a unitless quantity related to the concept of\nreflectance and usually specified in decibels (dB) rather than as a simple ratio or percentage. Its\n dependence on the imaging geometry is often important [91].\n10mm\nregions can be further subdivided. The visible band is conventionally divided into the spectral colours from\nviolet to red, while the microwave region is often is often designed by names of radar bands.\n12",

    "Page_26": "2.3ICESHEET ANDGLACIERS\nPermanent snow cover eventually forms a glacier, defined as an accumulation of ice and snow that\nmoves under its own weight. A glacier is defined as an accumulation of ice and snow that moves\nunder its own weight [91]. Glaciers occur in a huge range of sizes, with a ratio of approximately 10\nbetween the areas of the largest and the smallest [91]. The smallest glaciers are of the order of 10 ha\n(10? m?) in area, while the largest ice masses on Earth are the ice sheets of Antarctica and\nGreenland, representing between them about 99% of the mass and 97%of the area of land ice. Table\n2.1 summarizes the global distribution of land ice [91]. The total of 3.30x10'*m? represents about\n 77% of the Earth's fresh water, the remaining 23% being groundwater (22%) and lakes, rivers,\nsnow, soil moisture, and water vapour (1%) [109]. The total discharge rate from the Earth's land ice\nhas been estimated as 3 1012 m? per year [64] giving a mean residence time (the time for which a\n contrasted with the residence times of weeks or months for temporary and seasonal snow cover.\nThe goal of subsequent analysis of the remotely sensed data is to interpret the value of this\nreflectance and its spatial and temporal variations. In the case of remote sensing systems that detect\nthermal radiation, the sensor again measures the radiance reaching the instrument in a particular\nwaveband. This radiance is normally expressed as a brightness temperature, which is the\ntemperature of a perfect emitter (a so-called black body) that would produce the same amount of\nradiation [91]. The primary variable to be determined is the brightness temperature of the radiation\nleaving the Earth's surface (again, the effects of the atmosphere must be taken into account to relate\nthe brightness temperature measured at the sensor to the brightness temperature leaving the surface)\n[91]. The brightness temperature is related to the physical temperature of the surface and its\nemissivity, a unitless quantity that defines the ratio of the actual radiance to the radiance that would\nbe emitted by a black body at the same temperature [91]. It follows that the emissivity must\ntherefore take a value between zero and unity, and that it is unity for a black body [91]. Clearly, if\nthe emissivity of a material is known and its brightness temperature can be measured, its actual\nphysical temperature can be calculated. Active remote sensing systems can be divided into two\nmain types. Firstly, there are ranging instruments, whose primary purpose is to measure the distance\nfrom the sensor to the Earth's surface by measuring the time for short pulses of radiation to travel\ndown to the surface and back again [91]. From this information, the Earth's surface topography can\nbe investigated. The radiation is visible light or (more usually) near-infrared in the case of laser\nAs indicated by Table 2.1, the two ice sheets are enormously thick — on average over 1km, and\nreaching a maximum thickness of 4500 m in the case of Antarctica, about 3000min Greenland. In\nfact, the Antarctic ice sheet is really two ice sheets, the East Antarctic and West Antarctic ice sheets,\nseparated by the Transantarctic Mountains. The East Antarctic ice sheet is larger, thicker, and older\nthan the West Antarctic ice sheet; the former is almost entirely above sea level, while the latter is\n almost entirely below it. Like all glaciers, ice sheets flow in response to gravitational forces. Faster\nmoving regions of ice are called ice streams, essentially rivers of ice flowing across the slower-\nmoving ice sheet. Ice also flows from the ice sheets in the form of outlet glaciers (Figure 2.1).\nWhen these reach the coast the ice continues to flow over the sea, forming an ice shelf that is\nanchored to the coast, as displayed in Figure 2.2, where Reeves and Priestley Glaciers flow together\n and form the Nansen Ice Sheet (the name given by first explorer, although it is really an ice shelf).\nIce shelves are primarily an Antarctic phenomenon. Virtually all of the land area of Antarctica is\ncovered by the ice sheet, while only about 80% of the area of Greenland is ice-covered. About 50%\nof the Antarctic coastline has ice shelves attached to it, the largest being the Ross ice shelf, between\n200 and 10o0m thick and roughly the area of France. About 11% of the area and 2.5% of the\nvolume of the Antarctic ice mass is represented by the ice shelves [2o]. Ice shelves undergo flexure\n as a result of ocean tides, and the seaward parts are eventually broken off to form tabular icebergs,\nwhich float away and ultimately melt. This process is normally in equilibrium with the addition of\nmass to the ice sheet in the form of precipitation, although there is now considerable evidence that\n14",
    "Page_27": "collapse [91].\n Somewhat smaller than the ice sheets are the ice caps (Formally, an ice cap is up to 500,000 km² (5\n10ll m?) in area. Beyond this size it would be classed as an ice sheet), dome-shaped glaciers\ncovering high-latitude islands or highland areas, and typically a few thousand square kilometers in\nextent (Figure 2.3). The major ice caps occur on Iceland, in the Canadian Archipelago, Svalbard,\nand the islands of the Russian Arctic. The remaining classes of glacier are the valley glaciers, which\nform in mountain valleys, and piedmont glaciers which form when the ice from a glacier spreads\nout over flatter ground (Figures 2.4). Glaciers occur on all continents except Australia. The\nprincipal glaciated areas are Alaska, Iceland, Svalbard, Norway, the Russian Arctic islands, the\nAlps, southern Andes, Karakoram, and Himalaya mountains [1o5]. Of the Earth's glaciated area,\nexcluding the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, only a few percent occurs in the southern\nhemisphere, predominantly in Chile [95].\n2.4 PHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION\nRemote sensing, as we have already discussed and in the terms in which we have defined it,\ninvolves making inferences about the nature of the Earth's surface from the characteristics of the\nelectromagnetic radiation received at the sensor. This process of inference requires that we should\nestablish the relationship between the characteristics of the radiation and the relevant physical\nproperties of the material [91].\nA glacier is a large (usually larger than 1o hectares) mass of ice having its origin on land, and\nnormally displaying some movement. It is usually in a state of approximate dynamic equilibrium,\nwith a net input of material in its upper accumulation area and a net loss of material in its lower\nablation area. These two areas are separated by the equilibrium line. Figure 2.5 illustrates\nschematically the relationship between these areas and the flow of ice within the glacier. The input\nthe case of a glacier whose lower terminus is in water, icebergs that calve off and float away. The\nsnow is transformed to ice through a number of mechanisms [91].\n The surface of a glacier can be divided into a number of zones or facies, an idea developed by\nBenson (1961, [4]) and Muller (1962, [79]). These are illustrated in Figure 2.6, which is adapted\nfrom [88], as is the following description. Uppermost is the dry-snow zone in which no melting\ntakes place. This zone is only found inland in Greenland and over most of the Antarctic ice sheet,\n and on the highest mountain glaciers, where the annual average temperature is lower than some\nthreshold value that was originally proposed as -25°C [4] but is now believed to be around -11°C\n(Peel 1992). Next is the percolation zone, in which some surface melting occurs during the summer.\nThe meltwater percolates downward and refreezes to form inclusions of ice in the form of layers,\nlenses, and pipes. The dry-snow and percolation zones are separated by the dry-snow line. Below\nthe percolation zone, and separated from it by the wet-snow line, is the wet-snow zone in which all\nthe current year's snowfall melts. Below this, and separated from it by the snow line (sometimes\ncalled the firn line) is the superimposed ice zone. In this zone, surface melting is so extensive that\nthe meltwater refreezes into a continuous mass of ice. The lower boundary of this zone is the\nequilibrium line [91].\nNot all of these zones are present in all glaciers. As has already been stated, only the coldest\nglaciers possess dry-snow zones. Temperate glaciers, in which the temperature of all but the upper\nfew meters is at the freezing point, exhibit only wet-snow and ablation zones (the superimposed ice\nzone is generally negligible so the snow line and equilibrium line coincide) [91]. Ice shelves, which\nare parts of glaciers or ice sheets that extend over water, do not have ablation zones but instead lose\nmeltwater, and refreezing of sublimated ice to form depth hoar.

Firn is porous, since it contains interconnected air channels. However, once the\ndensity increases above about 0.83 Mgm-? these channels are closed off, resulting in ice in which\n closed air bubbles are trapped. Grain sizes in glaciers generally increase with depth, from typically\n0.5 to 1 mm near the surface to a few millimeters at greater depths. The grains in depth hoar can be\nup to 5mm in size[91].\nFIGURE_2. 3: Landsat satellite image mosaic of Devon Island ice cap, Canada.

The spatial distribution of the mass balance can be mapped by combining\ntime-difference DEMs with the surface velocity field [46]. For the central regions of Antarctica and\nGreenland radar altimetry or airborne laser profiling can be used, though with difficulty [119][27].\nRepeated airborne laser profiling surveys have shown that the Greenland ice sheet is stable in the\ncenter, though thinning at up to 1 m/yr toward the coast [65]. This technique has also been used in\nAntarctica, Alaska, and the Swiss Alps [27].\nFor glaciers on the peripheries of ice sheets the situation is more difficult [93]. Rignot in 2002 [93]\nadopted the following approach. The output ice flux is estimated from the product of ice shelf\nvelocity (from ERS InSAR) and the cross-sectional area, the thickness being derived from a suitable\nDEM [3] and the assumption that the shelf is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The input ice flux is\ncalculated by integrating the accumulation rate [33][113] over the delineated drainage basin. A\ncorrection is applied for basal melting. This work showed that the position of the grounding line of\nseveral major glaciers had previously been substantially misestimated [91]. Most of the glaciers are\n[94] on Greenland. Mass balance can also be estimated indirectly from changes in the distribution\n of the surface zones, e.g., expansion of the ablation area is indicative of negative mass balance. This\ncan be done using VIR imagery [66] or SAR. Mass balance can be inferred indirectly from the\nequilibrium line elevation (ELA), provided that the relationship between the two variables has been\ncalibrated [91].The equilibrium line often coincides more or less with the late summer snow line.\nThe European remote sensing satellites ERS-1 and -2 used radar altimetry to measure the altitude of\nice in the Antarctic ice sheets (Figure 3. The first study is comprised of data from 1992-2002 which\nshows a mass loss and a mass gain which contributed to an overall negative mass balance [125].\nThe ice sheet in West Antarctica (WA) is losing mass (-47 +/- 4Gt per year) and the ice sheet in\nEast Antarctica (EA) shows a small mass gain (+16 +/- 11 Gt per year) for a combined net change\n] (1   +)  d  71 -1-\n18",

Observations of terminus positions and of the gradual deformation of a straight line\n marked by painted rocks placed on the glacier surface have been replaced by more precise surveying\nmethods [76]. When viewed from space, however, natural surface features supply adequate markers\nwhen their size is small enough to avoid affecting the flow rate. The future certainly portends a\nreversal of roles for field and remote-sensing glaciologists, wherein a few carefully placed field\nmeasurements will be collected to provide control for the dense velocity data fields extracted from\nsatellite imagery [7] or from aerial datasets: as an example, the velocity-field of creeping mountain\npermafrost in Val Muragl, Swiss Alps, with speeds of up to 0.5 m per year, was determined with\nhigh resolution from aerial stereo imagery providing new insights in the spatial coherence of\npermafrost creep [58].\nKnowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of flow on fast-flowing Arctic [58] and Antarctic\nglaciers is still limited, but the flow mechanisms are crucial factors in determining mass balance and\nthus in controlling the reaction of these glaciers to climate changes, in particular when these glaciers\nare calving [58]. Therefore ice velocity is a critical parameter control, which, together with ice\nthickness, allows the determination of discharge rates.\nThis chapter describes the most utilized approaches to the determination of ice motion by satellite\nand for each technique advantages and disadvantages are specified.\nRemotely sensed data approaches can be direct and indirect. Indirectly, motion can be estimated\nfrom a detailed surface topography and assumptions about ice flow. In this chapter only direct\napproaches are shown, that are more used than indirect ones. The most direct approach is through\nthe identification of surface features such as foliation, crevasses and moraines, and tracking their\n motion in a time-series of images [43]. We examine the principal types of remote sensing systems,\npresenting theoretical outline and giving examples of important real cases.\nA not image-based approach is by Global Positioning System (GPS) ground survey [29], that with\nInSAR is the most accurate method, but it presents some severe limitations for the monitoring of\nice sheets [6] ( see paragraph 3.2.3 ).\n21",

Images were coregistered using common fixed points, such as\nmountain peaks and rock outcrops, and ice motion was determined by manually picking the position\nof persistent features on the moving ice.\n Clearly, good image-to-image registration is necessary for this technique. If enough stable ice-free\nfeatures (e.g., nunataks (Figure 3.1) or exposed rock surrounding a glacier) are visible in the images,\nthese can be used as control points. This approach is usually satisfactory for glaciers and the\nperipheries of ice sheets but not for the interiors of ice sheets, where such features are not usually\npresent [91].\nExpansion of the regions of interest into the interior of the ice sheet, where sharply defined fixed\npoints were absent, forced the development of new coregistration techniques.

This is best accomplished by acquiring scenes\nwith the same scene center location taken at the same time of the year. If there isn't a digital\ntwo images should be minimized by acquiring scenes with the same scene-center location.\nThe images are preprocessed prior to extracting displacement measurements in order to remove\nnoise (Paragraphs 5.2.1 and 5.2.2), to apply geometric correction (Paragraph 5.2.3) and to enhance\nthe similarity of ice surface features (Paragraph 5.2.4).\nPrecision of the derived velocity measurement increases with a greater time interval; however, an\nincreased time interval raises the chance that the surface features have changed in appearance.\nVelocity precision depends on the time separation and is a combination of the systematic error of\nimage-to-image coregistration and chip correlation. Because this measurement is made in the\nground plane of the image, the velocity is strictly the component in this plane. Generally, this\ncomponent is dominant, and only minor differences are expected between velocities measured by\nthis technique and the total speed.\n These methods can succeed only where there are features unique enough to produce correlation\n maxima. Crevasses and crevasse scars (bridged crevasses) traveling downstream from a source\nregion upstream are the most common source of these features. Fortunately, the most dynamic areas\nof the ice sheets, outlet glacier and ice streams, are well populated with crevasses, and their patterns\nhave proven to be surprisingly unique [7].\nIn 1992 a very complete mapping using this technique has been accomplished over ice streams D\nand E in West Antarctica [8]. Even with more rapid and accurate Global Positioning System (GPS)\nsurveying techniques, the production of a similar data set (over 75,000 measurements) would have\nrequired years of field work, thousands of aircraft hours, and great risk to surveyors’ safety\nincrevassed areas. The image-derived velocity field has proven accurate enough to provide an\naccurate determination of surface-horizontal strain rates (velocity gradients) [7].\nKaab [58], in 2002, computed horizontal movements from multi-temporal aerial photography and\nAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) orthoimages using a\ndouble cross-correlation technique.

He estimates the achieved accuracy\nfor horizontal displacements to approximate the size of one image pixel, i.e. 15 m for ASTER and\n 0.2 - 0.3 m for the here-used aerial photography.\nAlthough automatic feature tracking by using image cross-correlation is primarily applied to VIR\nimagery, it can also be carried out using SAR imagery [22][73][80]. Speckle tracking, in which the\nfeatures are the speckle pattern of the radar image, is also possible [77] [35]\n3.2.3 SAR Interferometry\nSAR imagery has been used in a cross-correlation manner similar to that described above to\ndetermine ice velocity [34][22][73]. However, interferometric SAR provides a methodology that\ngreatly extends the accuracy and the types of surfaces for which ice velocity data can be obtained\n[7]. The displacement measured by interferometric SAR combines surface topography and ice\n24",

In the absence of fixed points, measured velocities are necessary\nto control the velocity field. As in the topographic case, phase noise limits the precision and\ncomplicates unwrapping. A typical noise value of 10 at C band (6.3-cm wavelength) corresponds to\na precision of better than 1 mm, which, in the case of a 3-day image separation, corresponds to a\n               \nThese effects strongly influence the initial appearance of the calculated ice motion fringe pattern.\nCalculation of the desired velocity field requires an assumption of flow direction. Surface-parallel\na   s    s      n\nperpendicular to the surface is generally less than 1 m/yr [7]. An interferometrically derived DEM\ncan, once again, be employed to define the direction of maximum slope. If a second interferogram\nof an area is available from a different look direction, as is the case when data from ascending and\ndescending orbits are used, the two velocity components can be combined with the assumption of\nsurface-parallel flow to produce the full velocity field [56].\nIf the surface topography is known independently, it can be applied to individual interferograms\nexisted to measure topography and ice motion with one image triplet, and subsequent temporal\nchanges in velocities were measured by repeated use of this topography. Given the all-weather, all-\nunsuspected dynamic manifestations of ice sheets. The negative prospect of decorrelation and the\n Rapid metamorphism within the snowpack has hampered interferometric applications in warmer,\nhigher-accumulation glaciated areas. Rapid decorrelation encourages short revisit times. Yet at the\nscale of millimeters, vertical motions become significant, requiring accurate and detailed DEMs,\nwhich can be obtained only with relatively large baselines. Thus there are constraints that define an\n optimal revisit time and baseline length: if either are too long, correlation is lost; yet if either are to0\non the scale of the topography and the direction of flow relative to the orbit ground track. No single\nset of parameters is ideal for all ice sheet locations.\nLike all InSAR measurements, velocity determination depends on phase coherence between the\nimages. If the time interval is long for repeat-pass interferometry, this can be a problem [91]. The\nRadarsat Antarctic Mapping Mission AMM-1 [54] had a repeat period of 24 days, which is very\nlong by InSAR standards. Coherence was generally maintained only for areas with low\naccumulation rates, less than about 15 cm/yr, and in areas not strongly affected by katabatic winds\n or dynamic atmospheric conditions in general [55][121]. For the Radarsat repeat period and imaging\ngeometry, the accuracy in velocity determination is good for low speeds (less than about 1o0 m/yr),\nbut higher speeds cause difficulty in unwrapping the phase [55] (velocities on an ice shelf can reach\n1000 m/yr or more [122]). Joughin (2002) has developed a technique that combines both InSAR and\nspeckle tracking to cope with higher flow speeds. InSAR has also been used to monitor the flexure\nof ice shelves (of the order of a meter) and demonstrate that it is consistent with physical theory,\nyielding estimates of the position of the grounding line and the elastic modulus of the ice shelf\n[103][36]. Laser ranging will also have the potential to provide such information [87].\nUsing RADARSAT SAR imagery obtained during the 2000 Antarctic Mapping Mission, ice\nvelocity vectors were obtained over the Lambert Glacier [128] (Figure 3.4). Only a handful of in\nsitu velocity measurements have been previously reported of this huge glacier system.

Most of the Lambert itself has velocities\nbetween 400-800 meters per year, with a slight slowing in the middle section.

All together they have\ndifferent frequencies and magnitudes (see Figure 4.1). The Amplitude A reflects the level of the\nelectromagnetic energy. It may also be considered as intensity or spectral irradiance. If we plot A\nagainst the wavelength 1 we then get an electromagnetic curve, or spectrum (Figure 4.2).\nAny matter with a body temperature greater than O K emits electromagnetic energy. Therefore, it\nhas a spectrum. The light which our eyes can detect is related to the very small portion of the\n29",

Different elements are combined to form compounds, and each compound has a\nunique spectrum due to its unique molecular structure. The atmosphere has different effects on the\nEM transfer at different wavelengths and can have a profound effect on intensity and spectral\ncomposition of the radiation that reaches a remote sensing system. These effects are caused\nprimarily by the atmospheric scattering and absorption [142]\nScattering is the redirection of EM energy by the suspended particles in the air.

Passive sensors have two major spatial characteristics:\nInstantaneous Field of View (IFOV, Figure 4.4): is defined as the angle (radians or\ndegrees) over which the single detector is sensitive to radiation.\nSwath width (refer to Figure 4.4): This is defined as the linear ground distance covered\nin the across-track direction.\nSpectral Resolution - The term spectral resolution refers to the width of spectral bands that a\nsatellite imaging system can detect. It is linked with IFOV depending of the wavelength. Multi-\nspectral systems can detect in several discrete bands, it is the width of these bands that spectral\nresolution refers too. The narrower the bands, the greater the spectral resolution.\n31",

If data storage is not an\nissue, we may choose to sample the entire spectral curve with many narrow spectral bands.\nSometimes, we choose to make a discrete sampling over a spectral curve.

As spatial resolution\nbecomes finer, more details about objects in a scene become available. In general it is true that with\nfiner spatial resolutions objects can be better discriminated with human eyes. With computers,\nhowever, it may be harder to recognize objects imaged with finer spatial resolutions. This is because\nfiner spatial resolutions increase the image size for a computer to handle. More importantly, for\nmany computer analysis algorithms, they cause the effect of \"seeing the tree but not the forest\".\nComputer techniques are far poorer than human brain in generalization from fine details.\nTemporal sampling can be regarded similar to spectral sampling.

The spectral range is similar, and the instruments are again\npassive imaging instruments. Indeed, with the rapidly increasing popularity of digital photography,\nthis approach can be thought of as a form of aerial digital photography. The principal difference\nbetween the electro-optical systems and their photographic counterparts is the detection mechanism.\n In the former case, electromagnetic radiation is detected electronically, instead of photochemically\nas with photography. The electronic detection can take a number of forms, including the use of\nphotomultipliers, vidicons, semiconductor photodiodes, and one- or two-dimensional arrays of\nphotodiodes constituting charge coupled devices (CCDs), now familiar from their role in digital\ncameras and video cameras [91]\nElectronic detection offers several advantages over traditional photography. The detectors can be\ncalibrated, so that there is a known quantitative relationship between the recorded signal and the\nintensity of the electromagnetic radiation.

Remote sensing, using moderate to high-resolution satellite\nimages, permits glacier movement to be measured on sequential images covering the same area; the\nvelocities can be measured quickly and relatively inexpensively by tracking crevasses or other\npatterns that move with ice.

PCA is theoretically the optimum transform for a given data\nin least square terms.

Such low-order components often contain the \"most\ncomponent images: the first principal component (PCi) can be used for subsequent cross-\ncorrelations in order to enhance the surface features of glaciers and to ulteriorly reduce image noise\n[100].\n5.2.2Radiometric Correction\nAll images (ETM+ images apart) are at basic correction level. The preliminary processes discussed\nin this section are: 1) Calibration, 2) Destripe and 3) Noise Reduction\n Calibration: it is the process of converting the raw digital numbers (DNs) measured by\nsensor into physical quantities (e.g., radiances or brightness temperatures) that they represent.\nIn the case of space-borne imagery this task is normally carried out by the agency operating the\ncompared were recorded under different conditions, and pre-processing may be required to\nminimize the dissimilarity of feature shapes due to e.g. different solar illumination, season,\nsensor effects, etc. An user can correct these “at-satellite’ values for the effects of propagation\nthrough the atmosphere, in order to determine the corresponding ‘‘at-surface”’ values. For our\npurposes, standard calibration procedures implemented in used software in preprocessing step\nof the adopted software (ERDAS Imagine Pro and ENVI) have to be considered adequate.\n Destripe: striping or banding is systematic noise in an image that results from variation in\nthe response of the individual detectors used for a particular band. This usually happens when a\ndetector goes out of adjustment and produces readings that are consistently much higher or\nlower than the other detectors for the same band. In the case of MSS data, there are 6 detectors\nper band which scan in a side to side motion. If one of the detectors is miscalibrated, then\nhorizontal banding occurs on each 6th line. Similarly, in the case of TM data with 16 detectors\nper band, each 16th line in the image will be affected. The procedure that corrects the values in\nthe bad scan lines is called destriping.

The developers of the data set estimate that the\nhorizontal resolution of the DEM is about 2oo m in the Transantarctic Mountains and\nAntarctic Peninsula, and about 4oo m in the sloped coastal regions. For ice shelves and the\ninland ice sheet covered by satellite radar altimeter data, the horizontal resolution is about 5\nkm, but where the airborne radar sounding data were used, the horizontal resolution is about 1\nkm. For the plateau inside 81.5 degrees south latitude, horizontal resolution is estimated at\nabout 10 km [71]. The accuracy of geolocation (i.e., the accuracy of the position of a given\nfeature on the DEM) is governed by the accuracy of topographic data sources, and is\n generally better than the horizontal resolution of the DEM.

Another GCP's selection was applied, minimizing X residuals\n(flow direction, see Assessment Accuracy, Paragraph 5.4.3), spreading the points as much as\npossible in the image, attempting to select them away from the area where ground\ndisplacement is expected. The model needs at least five points to compute the solution (10\ncollinearity equation).

In general this is a resampling procedure: in general it\ninvolves interpolation to estimate pixel values for coordinates not represented in the original\nimage. The simplest form of interpolation, which is not really interpolation at all, is called\nnearest neighbour resampling (Figure 5.6).\n51",

This filtering remove brightness variation associated with large-scale topographic\nfeatures, or undulation [101]. Long-wavelength topographic undulation at the ice surface are due to\nresponse of ice flowing over long-wavelength features in the underlying bedrock [174]. Theses\nfeatures remain fixed while the small-scale surface features move with the ice [101]. The scale of\nthe filter should be roughly equal to the thickness of the ice flows over an undulation [175]. For ice-\nstreams flowing in the internal regions of Antarctica, one kilometer (about one ice thickness) has\nproven to be an effective choice for the cut-off wavelength.\nIn absence of fixed points and beginning with two images of an area acquired at different times.\nshort-scale and long-scale components, respectively [7]. The low-pass images contain surface\ntopographic components created by the underlying basal topography that are assumed fixed in space\n[7]. Thus the images can be coregistered by adjusting their relative positions until the cross\ncorrelation of these images is a maximum. An accuracy of 1-2 pixels is typical [7]. The same\ncoregistration adjustment is then applied to the two high-pass images.\nOur aim consisted to avoid the separation of each image into its short-scale and long-scale\ncomponents. We would an unique image that highlights both fine details (moving features) and\nundulations (underlying bedrock),\nIn this study, in order to increase the consistency of coregistration, we tried to use both fixed points,\nsuch as mountain peaks and rock outcrops, and underlying basal topography are. This goal was\n reached by a sequential application of low-pass and high-pass filters with boost (see Appendix 4) on\neach image.\nPrevious evaluations in the study area (costal region) established a cut-off wavelength of about 500\nm to intercept glacier features [11]. These tests were conducted changing the kernel size of an high-\npass filter applied to a couple of coregistered test images (Landsaat TM 1990-1992) showing a fast\nice-flow on David glacier tongue (Drygalski).\nLastly, histogram of the filtered images was than equalized to 8-bit brightness levels (se Appendix\n 5). This transformation made it possible to see minor variations within regions that appeared nearly\nuniform in the original image.\nIn order to evaluate the results of our procedures, tests was conducted on tsub-images of PC1\nLandsat TM 1992 and of SPOT M. 1994, chosen for the same reason written in the previous\nparagraph.\nTable 5.3 shows the statistics of cross-correlation (IMCORR) results using no-enhanced images\n(test 1), high-pass filtered images (test 2, Figure 5.9) and low/high-pass filtered images (test 3,\nFigure 5.1o).

As described in Paragraph 4.6, IMCORR algorithm is used both to\naccurately locate tie-point pairs in two images and to find the displacements of moving features,\nprovided that the features show little change in their appearance, and that the motion is strictly\ntranslational [134].

In the following discussion, it is assumed that the images are\ncoregistered, i.e., that a feature that does not move would be found at the same (sample, line)\ncoordinates in both images [134].\nThis IMCORR version takes either 5, 10, or 14 input parameters. The list of input parameters is\nshows in Table 5.4.\nThe output file is in AsCHI format, and consists of a series of lines with nine entries each.

A good compromise was reached using reference\nand search chips of respectively 64 and 128 pixel size, but the choice of chip size may be different\ncase by case, depending on geometric resolution of images and on the expected displacement of\nglacier features.\n57",

    "Page_84": "Conclusions\nThe proposed methodology for ice velocity calculation, based on the cross-correlation of\nmultitemporal satellite images, is simple to apply and yields a large amount of data in a short time.\nThe technique can be used to monitor very wide areas with limited costs, and allows the use of\nmixed data from different sensors.\nA first phase in the workflow is image preprocessing. In this first step spectral noises are removed\nand radiometric values are calibrated. The images are geometrically corrected and a subpixel\nprecision is achieved. Free downloadable data has been used as reference (Landsat Image Mosaic of\nAntarctica for planimetric information and Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project DEM vers. 2 for\naltimetry) and can be considered suitable for this purpose.\nSequential applications of low-pass filtering, high-pass filtering and histogram equalization enhance\nthe images for cross-correlation processing, both for coregistration and displacement\nmeasurements. The use of boost spatial filters is advised.\nImage coregistration techniques have been improved using a fine-coregistration procedure. It's\nbased on automatic extraction of a large number of tie points using image cross-correlation and on\nminimization of polynomial residuals along ice flow direction\nThe automatic selection of reliable ice velocities was enhanced, using statistical thresholds of\ncontrol parameters and applying a coherence filter appropriately developed, based on statistic\ncomputation of velocity module and azimuth around each measurement.\nof Scott Coast (Victoria Land, Antarctica) in terms of mass balance. About 12oo0 measures of\nsuperficial ice velocity were computed for the period January 1973 - February 2006, with an\nprevious study for the period 1990-1992 based on the same Landsat TM images, but comparison\nwith GPS data reveals that previously adopted method (semi-automatic features tracking) results\nless accurate than cross-correlation.\nThe average ice velocities don't show relevant changes during monitoring period. The superficial\nvelocities of principal flow present some cyclical irregularities along transversal profiles: the\nglaciological significance of this phenomenon must be investigated.\nThe hypothesis of translational movement is very restrictive, limiting the reliability of the results\nonly to the case of ice flowing along a rectilinear segment during time interval between correlated\nimages. In future studies it's favorable to estimate this approximation error and eventually to correct\nthe results in post-processing by computing the curvilinear abscissa of displacement along ice-flow\ntrajectory. The compute of three-dimensional velocity vectors will be also possible by using DEM\ninformation.\nAnother goal to reach in post-processing phase could be the geometric correction of velocity data,\navoiding the computationally heavy geometric correction of images  (orthorectification and\nresampling processes).\nThe monitoring of large ice flows, looking at the new employment of remote sensing techniques, is\nflexibility of image cross-correlation method in integration of data coming from the new available\nsatellites too.\nThe study of the correlations among the most evident global change phenomena (ice sheet melting.\nglacier acceleration, sea level rising, global warming, increasing of natural disasters, etc.) represents\n72",

For example, the coefficients in a low-frequency mask\nmight all be set equal to 1:\n1\nYou have the option to normalize the matrix. Normalizing the matrix replaces the cell values of the\nmatrix with the values divided by the sum of all values of the matrix except when the sum is zero\n[21].\nFor a 3 x 3 matrix the real matrix used to average the pixel values is:\n1/9　1/9　1/9\n1/91/91/9\n1/9　1/9　1/9\nThis simple smoothing operation will, however, blur the image, especially at the edges of objects.\nLuring becomes more severe as the size of the kernel increases. To reduce blurring, unequal-\nweighted smoothing masks have been introduced [115]:\n111\n80",
    "Page_93": "High-Pass Filters. It is more difficult to get a high-pass filter than a low-pass filter. Indeed, to get a\nhigh-pass filter, the general procedure is to apply a low-pass filter to the original image and then\nsubtract this low-frequency image from the original image. The result is then an image containing\n only high frequencies. Sometimes it is desired to enhance the high frequencies without removing\nthe low frequencies. This is called giving the image a high-frequency boost. This can be done by\nusing a gain factor G (usually between O and 2) and following the procedure involved in:\n(K\"x)u· - (x)·( + 1) = [(x)u - (x)] · + (x) = (x)\n(A4.2)\nExample of High-Pass filter with boost:\nstart with identity filter\n0\nafter subtracting a mean filter\nadd gain G (range 0 to2):\n81",
    "Page_94": "Appendix 5: Histogram Equalization\nHistogram equalization is a common technique for enhancing the appearance of images. Suppose\nwe have an image which is predominantly dark. Then its histogram would be skewed towards the\nlower end of the grey scale and all the image detail is compressed into the dark end of the\nhistogram. If we could ^stretch out' the grey levels at the dark end to produce a more uniformly\ndistributed histogram then the image would become much clearer.\n Histogram equalization involves finding a grey scale transformation function that creates an output\nimage with a uniform histogram (or nearly so).\nHow do we determine this grey scale transformation function? Assume our grey levels are\ncontinuous and have been normalized to lie between O and 1.\nWe must find a transformation Tthat maps grey values r in the input image F to grey values s =\nT(r) in the transformed image\nIt is assumed that\n· T is single valued and monotonically increasing, and\n.0≤T()≤1 for 0≤r≤1.\nThe inverse transformation from s to r is given by\nr = T'(s).\ns  n ee   os hi su pe  nu  n is  sn o n\nis 1, we have a probability distribution for grey levels in the input image P,(r)\nIf we transform the input image to get s = T(r) what is the probability distribution P(s) ?\nFrom probability theory it turns out that\n() =(0)d\ndr\n(A5.1)\nwhere r = T'(s).\nConsider the transformation\nmp(a)a=()=8\n(A5.2)\nThis is the cumulative distribution function of r.

    "Page_100": "Appendix 7: Propagation of Uncertainty\n[129] In statistics, propagation of uncertainty (or propagation of error) is the effect of variables'\nuncertainties (or errors) on the uncertainty of a function based on them. When the variables are the\nvalues of experimental measurements they have uncertainties due to measurement limitations (e.g.\ninstrument precision) which propagate to the combination of variables in the function.\nThe uncertainty is usually defined by the absolute error. Uncertainties can also be defined by the\nrelative error △x/x, which is usually written as a percentage.\nMost commonly the error on a quantity, △x, is given as the standard deviation, o, . Standard\ndeviation is the positive square root of variance, o'. The value of a quantity and its error are often\nexpressed as\n. If the statistical probability distribution of the variable is known or can be\nassumed, it is possible to derive confidence limits to describe the region within which the true value\n of the variable may be found. For example, the 68% confidence limits for a variable belonging to a\nnormal distribution are ± one standard deviation from the value, that is, there is a 68% probability\nthat the true value lies in the region  ± o.\nIf the variables are correlated, then covariance must be taken into account.\nLinear combinations\nLet f(x1,x2,.,n) be a set of m functions which are linear combinations of n variables x1,x2,..,Xn\nwith combination coefficients A1k,A2k...,Ank,(k = 1 -- m).\n(A7.1)\nCOV12COV13\nCOV12\nCOV23\n02\nMx\nCOV13\nCOV23\n(A7.2)\n, of fis given by\nV!\nAikMAt : Mf = ATM*A\n(A7.3)\nThis is the most general expression for the propagation of error from one set of variables onto\nanother.
