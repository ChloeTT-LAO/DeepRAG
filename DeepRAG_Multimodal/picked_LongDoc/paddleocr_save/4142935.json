    "Page_10": "CHAPTER I\nINTRODUCTION\nstigmatization in our society (Corrigan & Penn, 1999). This stigma often leads to\nindividuals with mental illness being separated from the community and discriminated\nagainst. For example, people are less likely to hire persons who are labeled as\nmentally ill (Link, 1982) and are less likely to lease apartments to them (Page, 1995)\nOne way to account for stigma is through attribution theory. Weiner (1980) first\nproposed that the attributions that an individual makes about the cause of some event\nwere linked to their emotional reactions and behavioral responses to that situation\nCorrigan (2000) expanded upon Weiner's attribution model in an effort to better\nconceptualize the process of stigmatizing the mentally ill. In a study of college\nstudents (2003), Corrigan found that participants’ familiarity with mental illness,\nperceptions of dangerousness, and attributions about the controllability of the cause of\nmental illness played a role in their emotional reactions and behavioral responses\ntoward the individual with mental illness. However, Corrigan's study did not include\na genetic attribution regarding the possible cause of mental illness nor did he\ninvestigate the interaction of the reported cause of the mental illness with levels of\n1",

The purpose of this thesis is to expand upon Corrigan's attribution\nreview of the literature concerning stigma, attribution modeling, and the connections\nbetween the two, as well as the specific purpose of the present study.\nStigma\nOne of the earliest conceptualizations of stigma was generated by Goffiman\nwho termed stigma an \"attribute that is deeply discrediting\" (1963, p. 3). He believed\nthat stigma reduces the bearer \"from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted\none.\" Goffman also defined stigma as the relationship between an “attribute and a\nstereotype.\" Through the process of stigma, an attribution made about individuals\nwho are part of a group (i.e. people with mental illness) takes on a negative\nconnotation becoming a stereotype. Goffman's work was followed closely by\nresearch carried out by Scheff. Scheff's (1966) theory concermed the labeling of\nbehavior, which in turn would lead to stereotypes about the labeled individual. This\nstereotyping results in the social rejection of the labeled individual, which may end in\nthe individual leading a life of \"residual deviance.\"\nA research group lead by Jones (Jones et al., 1984) also made a contribution to\nthe identification of the processes involved in stigma. They used the term “mark\" in\ndescribing all the possible conditions that would identify an individual as being\ndeviant. According to Jones, stigma occurs when this “mark” is linked to negative\ncharacteristics which leads to others making negative attributions about the\nrelevant to the present study. Peril refers to feelings of fear or discomfort caused by",
    "Page_12": "the mark of the stigmatized which play a part in the way in which an individual reacts\ntoward the stigmatized.\nA recent and more elaborate conceptualization of stigma comes from Link and\nPhelan (2001). They describe stigma as the confluence of the following dimensions\nlabeling, stereotyping, separating, status loss and discrimination, and dependence of\nstigma on power. In the first step of this model of stigmatization, the individual is\nlabeled based on a socially relevant difference. This labeled difference is then linked\nto undesirable characteristics or stereotypes. The next step makes a distinction\nbetween the labeled group and the mainstream. The labeled group is considered\nmarkedly different and separated from “normal\" society. This separation results in the\nindividual being devalued by society and discriminated against. A dimension that\nmore powerful group rejects a less powerful group does stigma truly occur. Although\nnot included in their original model, the dimension of emotional reactions is important\nto the concept of stigma (Link, et al., 2004). Emotional reactions represent a response\nto stigma that is easily discernable by the stigmatized and may influence the behavior\nof the stigmatized. Emotional attributions about the behavior of the stigmatized also\nplay an important role in the way in which an individual will think and act towards the\nstigmatized.\nStereotypes, Prejudice, and Discrimination\nAnother distinction must be made in the concept of stigma, the difference\nbetween public stigma and self-stigma. Public stigma, a concern of the present study.\ndescribes the way in which the general population stigmatizes individuals. Self-",
    "Page_13": "4\nstigma, on the other hand, refers to the loss of self-esteem and self-efficacy\n2002a, Corrigan 2000). Thus, the way that the public stigmatizes individuals affects\nthe way that they stigmatize themselves.\nPublic stigma consists of three dimensions: stereotypes, prejudice, and\ndiscrimination (Corrigan, 2003). Stereotypes are opinions about groups of persons\nthat have been collectively agreed upon by society. Although stereotypes generally\nhave negative connotations, they are a cognitively efficient way to categorize\ninformation about groups of people. An individual may be aware of a stereotype but\nnot necessarily endorse that stereotype. However, those who do endorse a set of\nstereotypes are considered to be prejudiced. These individuals have cognitive\nresponses and emotional reactions attached to the stereotypes they hold. These\nthoughts and feelings lead to discrimination, which is a behavioral response to the\nstereotype. Discrimination generally results in negative responses to the stereotyped\ngroup (Corrigan, 2000; Corrigan and Watson, 2002b).\nDiscrimination can take many forms, which may include “coercion,\n164). In the case of individuals with mental illness, treatment is often coerced, i.e.\nmandated by the courts or other authorities. Pescosolido and his colleagues (1999)\nobserved that the general public and treatment providers may endorse coercion\nthrough legal means, in the treatment of individuals with mental illness who are\nconsidered to be dangerous. Another type of discriminatory behavior toward",
    "Page_14": "5\nindividuals with mental illness is their segregation into treatment or living facilities\nthat are separated from the community.\nto individuals with mental illness also represents types of discrimination (Corrigan, et\nal., 2003). For example, the concept of social distance is a general desire to avoid\ninteraction with individuals suffering from mental illness. Link et al. (1987) found\nthat individuals labeled as mentally il, compared to “normal\" individuals, were\nevaluated by participants in the study as more dangerous, regardless of the actual\nlevels of disturbed behavior presented to the participants, and this resulted in an\nincreased desire for social distance. In another study, Link et al. (1999) found that,\ndespite the public's increased recognition of specific mental disorders and their\nmultiple underlying causes, the desire for social distance from the mentally ill and the\nperception of the mentally ill as dangerous is still strong. Socall and Holtgraves\n(1992) found a positive correlation between the expectation of a poor outcome for the\nindividual's illness and a desire for social distance.\nand more likely to defame individuals considered mentally ill. People are less likely\nto hire persons who are labeled as mentally ill (Link, 1982) and are less likely to lease\napartments to them (Page, 1995). Finally, there is evidence that people are more likely\nto falsely press charges for violent crimes against individuals with mental ilness\n(Sosowsky, 1980; Steadman, 1981).\nThe concept of labeling must also be considered when evaluating the effects of\nstigma. Link (1982) documented that persons who publicly bore the label of mental",
    "Page_15": "6\nillness had less income and were more likely to be underemployed, compared to a\nsimilarly impaired group of individuals who had not been labeled. Another study,\nwhich manipulated the presence of a label and the presence of aberrant behavior.\nfound that people were still likely to engage in stigmatizing behavior towards an\nindividual labeled as having mental illness, but not demonstrating any aberrant\nbehavior. This psychiatric label and the consequent negative social reactions can\nexacerbate the course of a person's mental illness (Link, Cullen, Struening, Shrout,\nand Dohrenwend, 1989).\nThe Attribution Model\nThe attribution theory of Wiener (1980) can aid in conceptualizing the\ntheory links human motivation and emotion to efforts to understand the causes behind\neveryday events (Weiner, 1980). Attribution analysis begins with trying to understand\nthe reasons for the outcome of a particular situation, in this case, the cause of the\nmental illness. The individual makes a decision about the reasons for an outcome\nbased on the locus of control, the stability of the cause, and the controllability of the\ncause. The locus of control can be either internal (in the person) or external (the\nenvironment). The stability of the cause may be stable (relatively permanent and\nunchanging) or unstable (subject to change). The controllability of cause is either\ncontrollable (subject to volitional control) or uncontrollable (not subject to volitiona)\ncontrol) (Weiner, 1980). Controilability of cause can also be broken down into onset\ncontrollability (the individual is responsible or contracting the illness) and offset\nresponsibility (the individual is actively trying to prevail over their illness) (Schwarzer",
    "Page_16": "7\n& Weiner 1991). These factors determine an individual's inferences about his or her\nresponsibility for a particular outcome. An individual's decision about responsibility\nis followed by an emotional reaction, which in turn affects the individual's behavior\ntoward the person being evaluated, as well as expectations about this person (Weiner,\n1995).\nThe public's attributions about the controllability of the cause of an\nindividual's mental illness would therefore have a great effect on their behaviors and\nemotional reactions toward a person with mental illness. If the cause of failure (i.e.\nmental illness) is seen as being in the individual's control, then the individual may be\nresponded to with anger and little pity and may be punished or neglected. However, if\nindividual is more likely to receive pity and help (Weiner, 1986). Weiner also noted\n(1988) that mental and behavioral problems are often considered onset-controllable\nhelping behaviors). Parsons (1951) noted that, if an individual is believed to have\nknowingly endangered his or her own health, then others will react to them with anger\nand evaluate them negatively. Batson (1987) suggests that empathy for an individual\nmay be reduced by the knowledge that the person's difficulties have been caused by\ntheir own undesirable or irresponsible behaviors. People will also make attributions\nabout the controllability of the negative behavior of an individual who has mental\nillness. Wiener found that, when an individual is considered in control of his or her\npsychotic symptoms, people perceive him or her as responsible for his or her actions\nand therefore react with anger (Weiner et al., 1988).",
    "Page_17": "8\nOther evidence suggests that the attributions that people make about the\ncontrollability of an individual's mental illness are related to their willingness to help\nthose individuals. It was found that people are less willing to lend aid to a person with\nsevere mental illness when they believe that the person is in control of their symptoms\n(Corrigan, River, Luden, Penn, et al., 2000). Though not concerned specifically with\nmental illness, a study by Reisenzen (1986) reinforces the association of attributions\nabout the controllability of cause and people's willingness to help. In this study, a\nsample of college students were evaluated on their willingness to assist a person whom\n, ao ',oq s on ot on ss padds, .'ynp, rie sm pio am Aay\ndifficulty seeing.\" The study found that the students were less likely to help others\nwho were labeled \"drunk\" or who had “skipped class to go to the beach.\"\nFurthermore, the students? feelings of anger or pity had an effect on their decision to\nhelp. Additionally, people often make a distinction between physical and\npsychological-behavioral disorders when making attributions about controllability.\nResearch also suggests that people tend to believe that psychological-behavioral\ndisorders involve more personal control than physical disorders (Crandall and\nMoriarty,1995).\nThere is less evidence in the literature concerning the role of locus of control\nand stability of cause in the attributions that individuals make about a person with\nmental illness. In a study of Americans? concept of mental illness (Martin, et al.,\n2000), participants were more likely to attribute mental illness to such causes as\nchemical imbalances, genetic factors, and stressful life circumstances (external) than",
    "Page_18": "9\ninternal attributions about a person's mental illness increased the desire for social\ndistance, while external attributions reduce the desire for social distance (Martin, et\nal., 2000). Research has found that, although the stability of cause does not\nnecessarily affect the type of emotional and behavioral responses to an event, it does\nplay a role in the strength of these responses (Weiner, 1995). Corrigan (2000)\nsuggests that if a cause is considered stable, atributions about it are more heavily\nweighted than when the cause is considered unstable. For instance, if the cause of a\nmental illness is considered stable (i.e. untreatable) then it may reduce the amount of\neffort a person is willing to put into helping the individual with mental illness.\nDangerousness\nThe perception of dangerousness also plays a role in the affective and\nbehavioral attributions that people make about individuals with mental illness. In\ngeneral, research has found evidence of attributing negative and unexpected behaviors\nto an internal locus of control (Jones and McGillis, 1976). Martin (2000) found a\nrelationship between ones? attributing mental illness to \"bad character\" (an internal\nattribution) and the perception that the mentally ill individual is dangerous. In a study\nby Pescolidio et al. (1999), most respondents indicated that people labeled as having\nschizophrenia are likely to be violent toward others. In general, when a person in the\nvignette bore the label of mental illness, participants indicated that they believed the\nindividual to be less competent and more likely to behave violently. The same\nparticipants were also more willing to endorse coercing these individuals into\nreceiving treatment. Martin et al. (2000) also found a connection between the\nperception of dangerousness and the endorsement of segregating individuals with",
    "Page_19": "10\nmental illness from the rest of society. Furthermore, information that leads to external\ncause attributions about a mentally ill person's violent behavior results in a less\nnegative evaluation of that behavior as compared to vignettes that implicated a more\ninternal source of the behavior (Boisvert and Faust, 1999).\nFamiliarity\nThe variable of familiarity seems to have a moderating effect on the\nattributions made about an individual with mental illness. According to Holmes et al.\n(1999), familiarity is the extent of an individual's knowledge and experience with\nmental illness. Holmes found an inverse relationship between familiarity with mental\nillness and prejudicial attitudes about mental illness. Link and Cullen (1 986) reported\nthat increased familiarity was related to decreases in feelings of fear towards\nindividuals with mental illness. Along similar lines, Ingamells et al. (1996) found a\ndiscrepancy between the attitudes of participants toward those with mental illnesses\nwhen they were split into a group that had a low level of contact with individuals with\nillness. When asked to respond to a vignette of an individual with mental illness, the\nlow contact group desired more social distance than the high contact group.\nDesforges et al. (1991) found that individuals who have positive contacts with\nmembers of a stigmatized group must resolve the discrepancies between their\nstereotypes about the stigmatized group and their positive encounter with a member of\nthat group. This contact leads to a more positive attitude toward the individual\nmember of the stigmatized group that may then be generalized to the entire group\nPrevious contact with the severely mentally ill has also been found to reduce the",
    "Page_20": "11\nnumber of negative emotions held about individuals with mental illness (Arikan and\nUysal, 1999). Finally, Penn and his colleagues (1999) reported that respondents whc\nhad prior contact with individuals with mental illness evaluated a client with mental\nillness described in a vignette as being less dangerous.\nAn Attribution Model of Public Discrimination Towards\nPersons with Mental Illness\nA recent study by Corrigan et al. (2003) has attempted to delineate a model\nthat connects causal attributions, familiarity, perceived dangerousness, emotional\nresponses, and the likelihood of helping or rejecting behaviors. They postulated that\nan individual's contact with the mentally ill (familiarity) would influence his or her\nperception of the danger represented by the individual with mental illness. This\nperception of dangerousness and atributions that the individual makes about the\ncontrollability of the person's mental illness would in turn influence his or her\nemotional response to the person with mental illness. Finally, this emotional response\nwould mediate the extent that the person would help or reject those with mental\nillness. Participants were asked to respond to vignettes that varied the controllability\nof the cause of the mental illness and the level of dangerousness. The results showed\nthat discriminatory responses, such as avoidance and endorsing coercive treatment.\ncould be predicted by perceptions of dangerousness and attributions about the cause of\nthe mental illness. If the cause of the mental illness was seen as controllable,\nindividuals responded with feelings of anger and fear. These emotional reactions were\nlinked to a desire for social distance and support for coercive treatment. However,\nwhen the cause was not considered controllable, participants tended to respond with",

Familiarity with mental illness\nwas found to moderate a desire for social distance and support for coercive forms of\nnegatively correlated with feelings of anger and fear.\nin Germany. Unlike the previous study, the vignettes used in this research either\ndescribed the symptoms associated with schizophrenia or the symptoms associated\nwith major depressive disorder. Despite differences in methodology, this study\nreplicated many of the findings from Corrigan et al. (2003). Familiarity with mental\ndangerousness reduced feeling of fear, which in turn reduced a desire for social\ndistance. Again, the model was able to demonstrate a connection between atributions\nabout controllability and dangerousness, emotional reactions, and behavioral\nresponses.\nThere are several questions that are left unanswered by the current research\nusing attribution models in the study of stigma towards the mentally ill. Though the\nliterature has addressed the negative impact of mental illness (Link, 1982; Link,\nCullen, Struening, Shrout, and Dohrenwend, 1989), the effects of labeling have not\nbeen assessed within the framework of an attribution model. Furthermore, are",

While previous research has\nmade some attempts to differentiate between levels of the controllability of the cause\nof the mental illness, the use of a bio-genetic origin for schizophrenia may have a\nmoderating effect on the attributions made about an individual with mental illness.\nFinally, prior research has not compared the variables of controllability,\ndangerousness, and label so that presence of interactions between these variables may\nbe clearly established.\nThe Present Study\n(2003). As in the study by Corrigan, the current study will investigate the relationship\nbetween causal attributions, dangerousness, emotional responses, and behavioral\nresponses. Participants will be presented with vignettes that describe an individual\nwith mental illness. The vignettes will vary in the controllability of cause (what lead\nto the mental illness), history of violence, and the availability of diagnostic\ninformation.

A score of 1 was assigned to the\nleast intimate situation which is described in item 8 (*\"I have never observed a person\nthat I was aware had a severe mental illness\") and a score of 13 was assigned to the\nmost intimate situation which is described in item 5 (\"I have a severe mental illness\").\nIn this version, a thirteenth question (item 7) was added which asked respondents if\nthey have an immediate family member with a severe mental illness. This was\nintended to distinguish between a close family member and a “relative” with severe\nmental illness. The wording of items 2 and 9 were modified to differentiate between\nthose who provide clinical treatment for those with mental illness and those who\nprovide other services.

    "Page_45": "CHAPTERIV\nDISCUSSION\nThis study examined the impact of history of violence, controllability of cause\nand diagnostic information on the attributions that participants would make about and\nemotional reactions they would have to an individual with mental illness (personal\nresponsibility beliefs, anger, fear, pity, likelihood of helping and coercion-\nsegregation).\nHypothesis I and Hypothesis Il: The Effect of a Controllability of Cause\nAn effect of the controllability of cause was found in the case of all six\nattribution factors. As hypothesized, the drug abuse cause for mental illness resulted\nin greater agreement with negative attributions and negative emotional reactions\n(anger, fear, and coercion-segregation) and less agreement with positive attributions\n(pity and likelihood of helping). These results replicate the results of Corrigan's\n(2003) study in which participants expressed greater desire to avoid and less interest in\nhelping an individual who was said to be in control of his mental illness. These\nfindings may be further explained by Crandall and Moriarty's (1995) finding that\npeople believe that mental illness involves more personal control than physical illness.\nHowever, the hypothesis that a bio-genetic cause would result in increased positive\n36",
    "Page_46": "37\nand decreased negative reactions to an individual with mental illness when compared\nto the automobile accident cause was not supported. Participants responded to the\nattribution questionnaire in a similar manner for both of these conditions on all six\nattribution factors.\nControllability of cause was the only variable to have a significant impact on\nthe personal responsibility beliefs factor. This is consistent with the finding by\nWeiner (1980) that an individual's perception of controllability directly influences\ntheir beliefs about another person's responsibility for their present condition. Not\nsurprisingly, participants believed a person with mental illness to be more personally\nresponsible for a drug induced mental illness than for a mental illness caused by either\nresponsibility for a bio-genetic and an accident caused mental illness may explain the\nlack of differentiation among these two causes on the other five variables.\nHypotheses III: The Effect of a History of Violence\nAnother important finding was the impact that a history of violence had on\nvignette resulted in participants being more likely to indicate feelings of fear and\nanger, as well as endorse attitudes that promoted coercion or segregation. Martin et al.\n(2000) also found that the perception of dangerousness lead to the endorsement of\ncoercion and segregation. When a history of violence was present, they were also less\nlikely to endorse helping behaviors. As hypothesized, individuals responded in a\nnegative manner to a person with mental illness whom they believed to be dangerous.\nThis is consistent with Corrigan (2003) who found that an increase in the level of",
    "Page_47": "38\nperceived dangerousness leads to the endorsement of discriminatory behaviors and\ngreater feelings of fear. History of violence did not have a significant impact on\nothers? feelings of pity, which was unexpected as it was reasoned that feelings of pity\nwould be reduced by expectations of dangerousness. In this case, it is speculated that\nalthough participants may fear and indicate a need for distance from an individual\ndescribed as having a history of violence, this concern does not reduce their feelings of\npity for the individual's condition.\nHypothesis IV: The Effect of Diagnostic Information\nIt was hypothesized that for the diagnostic information variable participants\nwould respond with the most negative reaction to the label only condition and the\nmost positive reaction to the symptoms only condition with the reaction to the label\nand symptoms condition falling somewhere in the middle. In a study by Link et al.\n(1987) participants evaluating an individual labeled as mentally ill considered that\nindividual to be more dangerous and indicated the desire for social distance from that\nindividual. A more recent study by Link et al. (1999) also found that individuals\nlabeled as mentally ill are considered more dangerous. More specifically, Pescolidio\net al. (1999) found individuals in a vignette who were labeled as mentally ill to be less\ncompetent, more likely to behave violently, and were likely to endorse coercive\ntreatment.\n In the present study, participants responded with more pity to the symptoms\nonly condition than to the label only condition. However, participants indicated more\nfear to the label and symptoms condition than to label only. The strongest",

Though there was a\nsignificant effect of diagnostic information on the likelihood of helping the results\nfrom the Tukey's post-hoc approached, but did not reach significance. For likelihood\nof helping, the label only condition resulted in greater (non-significant) endorsement\nof helping than either symptoms only or label and symptoms. It is theorized that\nparticipants reacted to the label only condition with more helping responses due to the\nsocial desirability of reaching out to an individual with a clearly labeled mental illness\nParticipants had the strongest reactions of pity, fear, and segregation-coercion to either\nthe symptoms only condition or the label and symptoms condition. Participants may\nhave had a stronger emotional reaction to the description of symptoms as opposed to\nthe label of schizophrenia. Participants may simultaneously fel repelled by the\nstrangeness of the symptoms described (fear), yet still feel a sense of how unfortunate\nit would be to have to live with such symptoms (pity). Pity and fear are obviously\nemotional reactions and the decision to coerce or segregate an individual with mental\nillness could be considered a cognitive decision affected by emotional reactions. It is\nlikely that the desire to maintain distance from an individual with mental illness would\nbe influenced by fear of the unknown and a sense of unpredictability\nInteractions\nA significant interaction was found between history of violence and diagnostic\ninformation for the factor of anger. A simple main effect was found for diagnostic\ninformation in the no history of violence condition, but not the history of violence\ncondition. This suggests that when a violent history was present the diagnostic\ninformation may have become less relevant in invoking an angry response. With no",
    "Page_49": "40\nhistory of violence participants indicated feeling more anger when given only\nonly the label. Participants may have had a reduced reaction to the label only because\nthey were not fully aware of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, but when\nthey were given the symptoms they saw the vignette character in a more negative way\ndue to the nature of the symptoms described. However, when a history of violence\nwas presented, the insignificant difference in results suggests that participants felt an\nequal level of anger no matter which diagnostic information they were presented\nHypothesis V: The Effect of Familiarity with Mental Ilness\nContrary to previous research, this study did not find that the use of\nparticipants? familiarity with mental illness as a covariate had a strong impact on the\nstudy's outcome. One significant finding was affected by the use of familiarity as a\nnegative feelings into a sharper contrast resulting in more clear distinction between\nthose who feel anger towards the character in the vignette and those who do not.\nUnlike a study by Corrigan (2003), the present study did not find familiarity with\nmental illness to moderate either a need for social distance or the endorsement of\ncoercion and segregation.\nbe more likely to endorse positive attributions about an individual with mental illness\nand less likely to endorse negative attributions about him. This anticipated effect was\nfound to some degree in the present study. A significant, negative correlation was",

There were also significant,\nmodest, negative correlations found between scores on the familiarity question and the\nfollowing factors: personal responsibility, anger, and fear. Finally, there was a\nsignificant, but modest positive correlation between scores on the familiarity question\nand the likelihood of helping. The presence of a significant correlation between the\n(2003) who used his own modified version of the report. In his study, Corrigan found\nthat familiarity was positively correlated with feelings of pity and negatively\ncorrelated with feelings of anger and fear. The present study was also similar to prior\nresearch by Holmes et al. (1999), which found an inverse relationship between\nfamiliarity with mental illness and prejudicial atitudes toward individuals with mental\nillness.\nSeveral reasons might account for the fact that familiarity with mental illness\ndid not have a greater impact on participants’ responses. Participants may not have\nassociated the character of David with the individuals with mental illness with whom\nthey are personally familiar. The David character was a sketchy description in a\nvignette rather than an actual person. If participants were placed in a live situation\nwith an individual said to have a mental illness, their prior experiences may have had a\ngreater impact. Additionally, participants may have been familiar with people with\nmental illnesses other than schizophrenia. Although participants may be empathic\ntowards the mental illnesses with which they are familiar, they may still retain a\nnegative view of schizophrenia. Finally, the variables manipulated in the vignettes",

Some of their responses\nreflected actual symptoms associated with schizophrenia (e.g., hallucinations,\nor split personalities with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Finally, a notable\npercentage (18.33%) believed schizophrenia was characterized by violent or\naggressive behavior. This data suggests that although many of participants are aware\nof the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, many other individuals either\nattributed the symptoms of other mental disorders to schizophrenia or mixed both\nactual and false symptoms in their descriptions. The participants’ inaccurate\nunderstanding of schizophrenia may have increased their negative emotional reactions\nand attributions toward an individual with mental illness, especially if they believe tha\nindividuals with schizophrenia are typically violent and have little control over their\neffect on participants given the label only condition as they would not have been giver\nwith a warped knowledge of schizophrenia would react with more fear and anger\ntoward the label only vignette, due to the tendency to react negatively to the unknown,\nthis was not the case. As suggested above, this lack of a negative reaction may be due\nto social desirability factors which induced participants to react in a more open and",

This serves as evidence\nthat greater education about mental illness is required to give the general populace a\nclearer understanding of the symptoms associated with various mental disorders\nAlong these lines, however, participants’ responses to the open-ended question about\nschizophrenia may have been affected by reading the vignettes before making theil\nresponses. To clarify the impact of reading the vignettes, future studies should control\nfor the order of either answering the question before being exposed to any other\ninformation or answering the question after being exposed to the presentation\nLimitations and Future Research\nSome limitations must be considered concerning the design of the present\nstudy. One possible limitation is that the project title was listed on the website that\nresulted in some confusion as to the qualifications required to participate in the study\nalso lacked a representative sample of the general population. The participants were all\ndrawn from first year students at a private midwestern college and their backgrounds\nwere not representative of the population as whole. They are generally younger, better\neducated, and have better educated parents than members of the general population\nTherefore, the findings of this study may not generalize to the general populace. Also,\nassigned to each vignette was relatively small. Future studies would be improved by\nhaving a greater sample size for each condition.",
    "Page_53": "44\nAlthough the internal consistency was good for the factors of the attribution\nquestionnaire, a greater variety of information may be achieved in future studies by\nincreasing the number of questions that represent each factor. This may be especially\nquestions (aggravated, angry, and irritated) as being more similar then was intended\nby the author. Other less direct questions assessing participants’ emotional reactions\nmay give a clearer picture of their feelings toward the character in the vignette. For\nexample, participants could be asked if they would walk on the other side of the street\nif an individual talking to himself was approaching them. This would gauge the\nemotion of fear without directly asking if the participant felt afraid. Another question\nVignette. As mentioned earlier, further study would be required to determine what\nimpact the information contained within the vignette had on participants’ descriptions\nof the symptoms and problems associated with schizophrenia.\nAnother limitation of this study is that the participants self-reported on their\nreactions to a character described in a vignette. For clarity's sake the descriptions in\nthe vignette did not stray far from the variables they were intended to represent. This\nmay have resulted in a lack of depth in the character's description, which as a\nconsequence may have reduced the participants’ empathic feelings toward the\ncharacter. More salient responses may also have been gleaned by having participants\nrespond to either an actual individual with mental illness (i.e. videotaped) or an actor\nportraying such an individual.",
    "Page_54": "45\nAn area of research that should be explored in the future would be the\nattributions that individuals with a mental illness make about themselves, others with\nmental illness, and those individuals who stigmatize them. While previous studies\nhave examined the detrimental effect of stigma on the socioeconomic status and\nmental health of individuals with mental illness, this proposed line of research would\nexplore the cognitive and emotional impact of stigma on individuals with mental\nillness. Furthermore, the impact that these thoughts and feelings have on these\nindividuals? interactions with society at large could be investigated\nSome of this study's hypotheses were supported by the results, such as the\nnegative impact of a history of violence and a negative reaction towards an individual\nwho seemed to have caused his own illness. However, certain hypotheses were not\nbio-genetic cause and to an automobile accident cause. Also, contrary to past\nresearch, the impact of familiarity with individuals with mental illness was found to be\nnegligible in the present study. Overall, the present study suggests that more\neducation is needed to increase the public's understanding of schizophrenia and to\nreduce the stigma that individuais with schizophrenia face in their lives. If the public\nbelieves that people with schizophrenia are dangerous individuals who have caused\ntheir own mental illness, then they will continue to make negative attributions about,\nand have negative reactions to, people with schizophrenia.",

However, people who are more familiar with individuals who have a severe mental\nillness are more likely to react to them in a positive way. The intent of this study was to\ndetermine the effect that labeling, dangerousness, and cause of mental illness has on the way\n people respond to an individual with severe mental illness depending on their own familiarity\nwith mental illness. It should be noted that in the descriptions of the cause of the individuals\n mental illness that neither the abuse of cocaine nor an automobile accident are considered\nvalid causes of schizophrenia. Instead, they would be labeled as substance-induced psychotic\ndisorder and psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition. The items in this study\nmeasured participants' beliefs, feelings, and likely behaviors towards a person with a mental\nillness. The future aim of this line of research is to discern what leads to both positive and\nnegative thoughts, emotions, and behaviors toward individuals with mental illness.\nBased on past research, there is little risk associated with completing these questionnaires. In\nthe event that I am in need of counseling for any purpose, I am aware that I can contact the\nCounseling Center at 229-3341.
