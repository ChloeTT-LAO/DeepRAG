It is the latter organisation that has been\nlargely responsible for the excellent Tokelau Censuses in 2006, 2011, and again in 2016.\nhave a very reliable time series over an entire decade with a wealth of data that are fully\ncomparable (which is not always the case with 5-yearly censuses that were conducted prior to\n2006).\nIn addition to objective data (things you can count), this report includes a number of subjective\n si syyi a!l yo enb, jo yidot aut punoe Aeadsa (siuye anoge jat no moy,) sansa\n'first' for the Tokelau census. Tokelauans generally consider themselves mostly very happy and\nhealthy', as the reader will see.\nThe current census is notable for another reason: it is our first one (indeed in the entire Pacific\nregion) to have been conducted using tablet computers rather than paper-based questionnaires.\nAssistance from the Pacific Community (SPC) is gratefully acknowledged. Not only did tablets\nfacilitate data entry and validation, data analysis was considerably faster.\nIt is with some pride that we completed the final 2016 Census report within six months of census\nday, 18 0ctober 2016.\nAcknowledgements\nWithout the incessant energy and motivation of Mr Michael Berry - leading the wider Stats NZ\n Census team of about 20 Wellington staff, supported strongly by Ms Sophie Davies and Ms Avril\nMacfarlane, and the Stats NZ editing team - there would have been little to show for.\nExtensive support in the Apia TNsO was given by Dr Jaap Jasperse and Mrs Mafa Mativa. Locally\ntrained interviewers conducted the questionnaires on the three atolls and in Apia, with the District\nfor their hard work, not to mention all Tokelauans for their data, and the three Taupulega (village\ncouncils) for supporting the operations.\nSadly our National Statistician, Mr Kele Lui, was unable to partake in his favourite survey for this\nthird time, due to ill health. His presence and calmly persuasive style were at times sorely missed.\nNevertheless we think the 2016 Census was a great success, as evidenced by the series of official\npinnacle.",

Significant planning and consultation occurred in both Tokelau and New Zealand,\nto develop and carry out a census that best met the needs of the Tokelau public and policy\nmakers. Tokelau Public Service staff, key atoll stakeholders (including the general managers), staff\nconsulted on all aspects of the census throughout its development.\nThe 2016 Census form was based on the 2011 Census, although with substantial content\nadditions, most notably around including quality of life measures.\nTechnology changes\nBefore the 2016 Tokelau Census we decided to move from administering the census on paper, as\npersonal interviewing) was a carefully considered decision, motivated by a desire to produce high\nquality statistics for Tokelau decision-making as efficiently as possible.\nEnumerators in Tokelau for previous censuses wanted to use a format that was more user friendly,\nto let them more easily navigate the questionnaire and provide a better experience for\nrespondents. Paper questionnaires were used previously, which meant a considerable amount of\ntime and resource was used to enter the data before analysis could begin.\nrespondent's children based on a total number of children), and to direct them to questions they\nthe enumeration and post-enumeration phases.\nUsing tablets required more intensive training, which the trainers did well.

Survey Solutions can collect data\nofline. When interviewers returned to the each atol's headquarters on census day, we used the\nwi-fi connection to upload the data to a server in Washington DC in the United States.\n8",
    "Page_9": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\nAn additional benefit of the tablets was that once the data was uploaded to the server it was safe\nand secure. In previous censuses, although we had no issues, there was the risk that forms could\nbe lost between the census on the atolls and the data entry phase in Samoa.\nTokelau was the first place in the Pacific to use tablets to conduct their census.\nChallenges of measuring Tokelau's population\nmigration poses a unique challenge in counting the population.\nIn the 2016 Census, approximately 20 percent of the usually resident population was away from\nnotable reasons for absence. Due to the high number of people absent from Tokelau on census\ncriteria were applied consistently across the 2006, 2011, and 2016 Censuses.\nThe Tokelau Census team was committed to producing an accurate count of Tokelau's population\nand ensuring we collected information about all usual residents. Demographic information was\ncompleted by the head of the household for usual residents who were away on census day\n(absentees). Where the whole household was absent on census day, the census day supervisor for\neach atoll was responsible for answering basic demographic information for the household. We\nalso collected information that allowed the team analysing the data to ascertain whether the\nabsentee was a usual resident (under the criteria)\nService (TPS) and their families in Samoa.\nStats Nz's role\nA special relationship exists between the Tokelau National Statistics Office (TNsO) and Stats NZ\nStats NZ was contracted to conduct the Tokelau Censuses in 2006, 2011, and 2016.

Other than census, the adviser's focus is economic\nstatistics, such as calculating the quarterly consumer price index (CPl), since 2012, and various\nother indicators. We expect Stats NZ will continue to play a significant role in expanding and\nimproving TNSO's work.\nThe purpose of Tokelau's Census\nThe Tokelau Census provides detailed information about the entire population and dwellings of\nTokelau. There is currently no other source of official data about Tokelau collected on the same\nscale.\nCollecting data to make decisions is a primary purpose for the census. We hope the census data\ninformation can be used to compare 2016 Census results with 2011 and 2006 results. However,\nwon't be possible.",
    "Page_10": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n2 Geography and history\nGeography\nTokelau comprises three small coral atolls - Fakaofo, Nukunonu, and Atafu. Fakaofo sits roughly\n500 km north of Samoa. Nukunonu lies 64 kilometres north-west of Fakaofo, and Atafu lies 92\nkilometres north-west of Nukunonu.\nThe three atolls have four villages, with Nukunonu and Atafu having one each, and Fakaofo having\ntwo, with close ties between these two. All Tokelau's villages are concentrated on the western\nsides of the atolls, close to small natural passes into the sheltered central lagoon. Canoes and\nocean.\nTokelau has close ties to Samoa, with many Tokelauans living in Samoa. Boats transporting\nTokelau is by boat, which takes a minimum of 24 hours to reach the first atoll.\nThe low fertility of the coral soil in Tokelau means that few crops are supported. Coconuts,\nbreadfruit, and some bananas grow on the islands. Fish are an important food source. Food needs\nHistory and settlement\nArchaeological evidence shows that Tokelau was settled about 1,ooo years ago. Linguistic records\n19th Century.\nOral traditions tell the three atolls were largely independent, while maintaining cultural and\nlinguistic similarities. A fourth island, Swains Island, is considered culturally part of Tokelau,\nalthough it is now administered by the United States as part of American Samoa.\nThe first European contact with Tokelau was reported in 1765. From the 1840s, Europeans\nincreased their exploration of the region, introducing new food and materials to Tokelau.\nIn the 1860s, Peruvian slave ships visited Tokelau and removed almost all able-bodied men from\nthe islands. Of the 253 men forcibly taken, most died of smallpox or dysentery - very few returned\nto Tokelau. The removal of almost the entire population of able-bodied men forced a change in\nwhere families on each atoll are represented on the village Council of Elders (Taupulega).\nFrom 1877 to 1926, Tokelau was a British Protectorate.\nTokelau's relationship with New Zealand\nIn 1926, the administration of Tokelau passed from Britain to New Zealand. However, Tokelau is\nresponsible for its own running, and since 2oo3 Tokelau has been responsible for administering its\nown national budget.\nIn 2006 and 2007, Tokelau ran two referendums to decide whether the country should become a\n10",
    "Page_11": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\nIslands and Niue. Both referendums failed to reach the required margin to pass. Tokelau remains a\nnon-self-governing territory of New Zealand.\nRegardless of the future legal state of the relationship between Tokelau and New Zealand,\nTokelau will continue to have close ties with New Zealand. In New Zealand's 2013 Census, more\nthan 7,oo0 people identifying as Tokelauan were living in New Zealand.\n11",
    "Page_12": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n3 Population definitions\nThe 2016 Tokelau Census used three main population counts to define the population of Tokelau.\nEach count has an important difference, and people need to understand these differences to be\n able to use the most appropriate count.\nIn figures 3.1 to 3.3, a dark blue box indicates the group is included in the population count, and a\nlight blue box indicates the group is excluded from the count.\nDe jure usually resident population\nThe de jure usually resident population count includes the usually resident population present in\nTokelau on census night plus usual residents who are temporarily overseas at the time of the\ncensus. Those temporarily overseas include Tokelauan employees of the Tokelau Public Service\n(TPS) based in Apia, and their immediate families, and usual residents who are temporarily\noverseas.\nThe de jure usually resident count is the one that determines the number of representatives for\neach atoll in the General Fono (parliament).\nFigure 3.1 illustrates which groups are included and excluded from the 2016 Tokelau Census de\njure usually resident population count.\nNote: TPS is Tokelau Public Service.\nFigure 3.1\nComposition of the de jure usually resident population\nUsual residents\nUsual residents\nabsent from\npresent in\nTokelau on\nTokelau on\ncensus night\ncensus night\nTokelauan TPS\nVisitors and\nemployees and\ntemporary\ntheir immediate\nresidents\nfamilies\n心",

It gives a detailed breakdown of the composition of the Tokelau population.\nDue to Tokelau's remoteness and small population, access to services such as education and\nhealthcare are limited. As a result, many of Tokelau's population frequently travel overseas to\ntemporarily overseas, we collect information about these usual residents.\nFinal counts for 2016\nThe three different population counts available from the 2016 Census are outlined below.\nDe jure usually resident population\nThe de jure usually resident population in 2016 was 1,499. This was a 6.2 percent increase from the\n2011 de jure count, which was 1,411.\nThe de jure count was made up of 1,197 usual residents who were present in Tokelau on census\nnight, and 302 usual residents who were overseas.\nThe absentee sub-population of 302 includes 48 Tokelauan TPS employees and their immediate\nfamilies based in Apia, and 254 usual Tokelauan residents who were overseas at the time of the\ncensus.\nUsually resident population present on census night\nThe usually resident population present on census night in 2016 was 1,197. All usual residents had\na census interview, or had one done on their behalf (young children), and therefore this count is\nthe group we have the most information about. Heads of households provided some basic\ninformation about absentees.\nThere was a 4.7 percent increase in the usual resident population present on census night from\n2011, when the population was 1,143\nCensus night population\nThe census night population count in 2016 was 1,285. This figure includes all residents, temporary\nresidents, and visitors present in Tokelau on census night. This is a 6.6 percent increase from 2011,\nThe census night population count shows how many people are in Tokelau at a point in time every\nfive years.\nAbout the population's structure\nOne-fifth of the population were away on census night\nOf the total de jure usually resident population, 20.1 percent were absentees (302 people). The\n15",
    "Page_16": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\nThe proportion of absentees is down from the 2011 and 2006 Censuses. In 2011, 23.4 percent of\nthe de jure usually resident population were absentees, and in 2006 over one-quarter (26.7\npercent) of this count were absent on census night.\n(21.1 percent). Nukunonu had the lowest proportion of absentees (14.8 percent). In 2011\nNukunonu was the atoll with the highest proportion of absentees.\nAt the national level there were similar proportions of male and female absentees. Of the total\nmale population, 20.5 percent were absent on census night, compared with 19.8 percent of\nfemales.\nRatio of male to female absentees on each atoll\nLooking at the de jure usually resident population for each atoll (table 4.1), the ratio of males to\nfemales for each atoll varies. Atafu had 94 males for every 100 females and for Fakaofo the ratio\nNationally the ratio of males to females was relatively balanced, at 102 males to 100 females,\nwhich was similar to 2011 where it was 99 males to 100 females.\nThese results are similar to those in 2011, when Nukunonu had the highest ratio of males to\nfemales. Nukunonu had exactly the same sex ratio (127 to 100 females) in 2011 and 2016.\nTable 4.1\nMen and women present and absent from Tokelau on census night\nBy atoll of usual residence\nFor de jure usually resident population, 2016\nMale\nFemale\nTotal\nUsualresidence\nPresent\nAbsent\n Present \nAbsent \nPresent\nAbsent\nAtafu\n198\n53\n215\n53\n413\n106\nFakaofo\n185\n41\n214\n44\n399\n85\nNukunonu\n218\n33\n167\n30\n385\n9\nSamoa\n28\n20\n0\n0\n0\n48\nTotal\n601\n155\n596\n147\n1,197\n302\n Source: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\nMost of Tokelau's people are under 30 years\nTokelau on census night. The figure widens at the base, showing that Tokelau has a youthful\npopulation.\nIt becomes particularly narrow for the 65+ age groups, with only 12.0 percent of the population\nbeing 65+.\nFigure 4.1 also shows the sex structure across the different age groups. Overall men show a\nsmoother transition between the age groups, with a general decrease as you move to the older\nage groups. The percentage of women in each age group shows less consistency. Some of this is\nexplained by women living longer - significantly more women than men were aged 75+.\n16",
    "Page_17": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\nMore detailed analysis of the variability would be an interesting avenue for further analysis. It may\nbe simply a feature of the small population size. Other possible explanations are that more\nwomen leave Tokelau, or there were periods in Tokelau's history when fewer female babies were\nborn.\nThe median age for the usually resident population present in Tokelau on census night was 25\nyears. In 2006 the median age was 22 years and in 2011 it was 24 years. In 2016, the median age for\nmales was 23 years (22 years in 2011) and 27 years for females (25 years in 2011).\nFigure 4.1\nAge-sex distribution\nUsually resident population present in Tokelau\nCensus night, 2016\nAge (years)\n>75\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n50-54\n45-49\n40-44 \n35-39\n30-34\n25-29\n20-24\n15-19\n10-14\n5-9\n-0\n15\n10\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\nPercent\nMaleFemale\nSource: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwelings\nFigure 4.2 shows the age-sex distribution for the de jure usually resident population, which\nincludes absentees and TPS employees and their immediate families based in Apia.\nFigures 4.1 and 4.2 show few differences.\nThe biggest differences are for the 20-24 and 25-29-year age groups - figure 4.2 is wider for these\ntwo groups than figure 4.1.

    "Page_79": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\nEnsuring these mandatory variables were completed was made easier by the use of tablets. When\nmandatory variables were somehow still missed then we determined the answer by one of these\nmethods:\n· the interviewer was instructed to go back to the respondent\nrespondent.\nEditing and data processing (Survey Solutions)\nThis time editing was quite different from the 2011 Census. We had checks in place on the data\ncollection software (Survey Solutions) for unrealistic answers and quality-checked the raw data on\ncensus day and the day after. If there were any errors that we spotted, they were immediately\nfixed by the interviewer. This meant that much less editing was needed to be done on the dataset.\nAny changes that were made were documented. We took this approach to allow a record to be\nkept of how many changes were undertaken which will be of use when planning the next census.\nThe main form of editing that took place on the final dataset was the checks around who was a\nusual resident. This was to make sure the official population count was accurate.\nOutputconsultation\nWe made two trips to Tokelau and Apia in the six months leading up to the 2016 Tokelau Census.\nIn both of these visits we met key stakeholders on each of the atolls as well as those in the Tokelau\nPublic Service in Apia. We sought to determine first of all what content people needed to be\ncollected and what ouputs they would like to see us produce. We also invited the New Zealand\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide comment and they provided some useful\nfeedback. The approach to produce the same outputs as 2011 was agreed on and the respective\noutput products were produced and released.\nThe following census data releases have been completed, and are available on\nwww.tokelau.org.nz:\n· 11 November 2016 - Final population counts: 2016 Tokelau Census\n· 1 February 2017 - 2016 Tokelau Census tables (for demography, economic activity,\nmigration, education, social profile, dwellings and households, and quality of life)\n· 13 March 2017 - 2016 Tokelau Census atoll profiles (for Atafu, Fakaofo, and Nukunonu)\n· 2 May 2017 - Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings.\nConfidentialityrules\ngood quality, we used a confidentiality calculation to control the size of tables produced for the\ncensus outputs.\nThe confidentiality rule, called the 'mean cell size rule', states there must be on average two or\ngeography is village. The main purpose of these rules is to prevent tables from becoming sparse\n(that is, with many cells containing zeros and ones).\n79",
