Describe the process used to collect community input and prioritize health-related needs\n2. Highlight community voices and their experiences\n3. Describe the current state of health and well-being in Kent County using recent data on the demographic and\nfocus on how these factors differ by race, ethnicity, age, sex, and income.\n4.

Indicators were selected to broadly describe the\npopulation and socioeconomic characteristics of Kent County; the social and structural determinants of health (such as\npoverty, housing, and built environments); and common health risk behaviors. Morbidity and mortality indicators were\nselected based on the leading causes of death and hospitalizations in Kent County.\nBehavioralRiskFactorSurveillanceSystem(BRFSS)Survey\nThe BRFSS is an ongoing telephone survey that collects information about health-related risk behaviors, chronic health\nconditions, and use of preventive services.
