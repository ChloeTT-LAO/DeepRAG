Windlesford Green Hostel, Holmsley Lane, Woodlesford: There are mature trees on the site\nthat should be protected. Preference for this sites to be developed as flats as this would allow a\nhigher density (possibly upto 40 units).

Development of this site\ncould contain a larger number of smaller units than the Leeds Site Allocation Plan proposes.\nc) HG2-178. Aberford Road - site of Glenoit and Minerva Mills, Oulton: Small business premises would\nbe viable on this site together with flats. By building flats instead of houses, the capacity of the site\ncould be increased considerably. The canalside location would make it an ideal location for one or\nmore restaurant.\nd) MX2-14. Aberford Road (77/79), Oulton LS26 8HS: The site is classified for mixed development. About\nhalf the site currently houses a garage and car showrooms. The southern part of the site is likely to be\navailable and should be developed to strengthen the Oulton village hub. The site would be ideal for\nextra care housing. It is well situated for this, being near to shops, post office and a caf√© and on a bus\nroute. Such a development will increase the site's capacity. The frontage on to Midland Street\n(approximately 30m) also has potential for development.\ne) HG2-179.

The Trust are confident that\nthe policies proposed are based on a desire to protect this valued asset and it\nwelcomes this. However, the Trust does have significant concerns that the\ndesignation of land next to the canal as Local Green Space may have\nunintended consequences, which could prevent future proposals to enhance\nthe enjoyment of the canal. This may include the provision of visitor facilities,\nincluding the provision of facilities to enhance the use of the waterway for\nboaters, watersports, and fishing; and changes to the use of moorings to \nallow the mooring of boats that could promote tourism on the waterway.\nThe Trust note that policy BE1 'New Business and Employment Development'\nseeks to encourage the development of a local visitor/tourism economy,\nparticularly in canal corridor locations. The Trust has concerns that the\ndesignation of land next to the waterway as Local Green Space could have\nthe unintended consequence of being in conflict with the aims of policy BE1\nSlder\nand would potentially sterilise the ability for the Trust and the local\ncommunity to promote activity upon the waterway.\nSpecifically, as an example, the Trust note that paragraph 3.7.1 (part f)\nmentions aspirations that include the potential provision of a visitor\ninformation centre/caf√© next to Woodlesford Lock. This would be within part\nof the proposed Local Green Space within parcel CSE. A caf√©/visitor\ninformation centre building would impact upon the openness of the site.\nTherefore, the designation of the land as a Local Green Space could prevent \nthe delivery of this facility, as it could be viewed as being contrary to the\nd susuueld ieuon aue jo ge ydeed ui no pas suawainba Arod\nFramework (NPPF) for development on such designated spaces.\nParagraph 77 of the NPPF sets out three tests that must be met before land\ncan be designated as local green space. The Trust considers that insufficient\nevidence has been provided to justify the designation of long stretches of\nland adjacent to the canal as Local Green Space. In order to be designated as\nsuch, the area of land must meet all the qualifying criteria set out in\n paragraph 77 which states that the:\n\"Local Green Space Designation will not be appropriate for most green areas\nor open space. The designation should only be used:\n Where the green space is in reasonably close proximity to the community it\nserves;\n Where the green area is demonstrably special to the local community and\nholds a particular local significance, for example because of its beauty,\n historic significance, recreational value (including as a playing field),\n24",
    "Page_127": "tranquillity or richness of its wildlife; and\n Where the green area concerned is local in character and is not an\nextensive tract of land\".\nIt is the opinion of the Trust that the stretches of land within WH1, CSE and\nCSW do not accord with the above tests and consequently should not be\nlder\nincluded within proposed local green space designation. Sections of CSE and\nWH1 being considered for the designation are not within close proximity to\nthe villages that the plan relates to. Land to the north of CSE is separated\nfrom the village of Woodlesford by the Aire and Calder Navigation and it is of\nserious concern to the trust that there is no direct safe pedestrian access\nacross the canal. The Forum should note that the locks are unofficial\ncrossings, do not form a safe or convenient route and should under no\ncircumstances be identified as doing so. Additionally, parts of WH1 next to\nLemonroyd Marina are more than 1.2km from the closest village boundary.\nThe Trust has been unable to identify where justification has been provided \nas to why these land parcels (WH1, CSE and CSW) are \"demonstrably\nspecial\", or hold particular local significance. No evidence has been provided \nto indicate that there is a discernible difference in appearance, character or\nheritage value of these stretches of land to those adjacent areas not \nconsidered for the Green Space designation, either within or outside of the\nneighbourhood plan area.\nThe Trust believe that the size of the proposed land parcels exceed what \ncould properly be defined as local in character' as required by the paragraph \n77 of the NPPF, and make up extensive tracts of land. Both CSE and WH1\ncomprise of several hectares of land, and all three of the tracts of land next\nto the waterway proposed are over 1km in length.\nThe Trust is unclear as to the rationale behind the designation of WH1, CSE\nand CsW as Local Green Space.

The canal forms part of the Trust's\noperational land, and in accordance with its charitable objectives the Trust\nwill continue to manage the canal as it is presently laid out.
