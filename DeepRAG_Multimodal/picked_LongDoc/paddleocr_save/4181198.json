The goal of the outcome measurement was to assess the effect of MiDD strategies on MIDD\npolicy goals and other expected results. MiDD document reviews and interviews identified the following\nchallenges related to the output and outcome measures selected for the MiDD evaluation:\n· No or too few proximal outcomes are measured for many MiDD strategies.

This vote adopted Ordinance 15949,\nin which the Council authorized the collection of the sales tax and established five policy goals to guide\nthe development of the MIDD implementation:\nAdopted MIDD Policy Goals\nOrdinance 15949\n1. A reduction of the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent using costly interventions like\njail, emergency rooms, and hospitals;\n2. A reduction of the number of people who recycle through the jail, returning repeatedly as a result\n 3.  A reduction of the incidence and severity of chemical dependency and mental and emotional\ndisorders in youth and adults;\n4.Diversion of mentally ill and chemically dependent youth and adults from initial or further justice\nsystem involvement; and\nand Juvenile Justice Operational Master plans, the Plan to End Homelessness, the Veterans and\nHuman Services Levy Services Improvement Plan and the King County Mental Health Recovery\nPlan.\n Ordinance 15949 also called for the development of three separate plans to be completed prior to the\nrelease of MIDD funds:\noversight of the MiDD action plan, the role of the group, and how the group would coordinate with\nother county groups. Ordinance 15949 also outlines the types of representation that should\ninvolved in the mental health, substance abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault, homeless,\njustice, public health, and hospital systems.\n·  Implementation Plan. The implementation plan was required to describe the implementation of the\nprograms and services outlined in the Mental lliness and Drug Dependency Action Plan, including a\nimplementation. The implementation plan would also include a spending and financial plan\ndeveloped in collaboration with the oversight group.\n·Evaluation Plan. The Evaluation Plan was required to describe an evaluation and reporting plan for\nthe programs funded with the MiDD sales tax, including a process and outcome evaluation\ncomponent; a proposed schedule for evaluations; output and outcome measures and measure\ntargets; and data elements that would be used for reporting and evaluations.\nThroughout 2007 and 2008, the County worked with community partners to develop the plans required\nby the original MlDD ordinance.\nThe first plan to be adopted was the Oversight Plan, via Ordinance 16077, in April 2008. This plan\nestablished the MiDD Oversight Committee as an advisory body to the King County Executive and the\nCouncil. Its purpose is to ensure that the implementation and evaluation of the strategies and programs\nApril 14, 2016\nFinal Report\n31",
    "Page_34": "MIDD Evaluation Assessment\nFinal Report\nfunded by the MIDD sales tax revenue are transparent, accountable, collaborative, and effective. The\nOversight Committee first convened in June 2o08 and has met approximately monthly ever since.\nThe Implementation Plan was adopted via Ordinance 16261 in October 2008. It outlines the programs\nand services that would be funded by MiDD and the budget and spending plan for each. The\nImplementation Plan established that MiDD would support an integrated system of:\n Prevention and early intervention services\nCommunity-based treatment\n· Expanded therapeutic court programs\n Jail and hospital diversion programs\nHousing and housing supportive services.\nThe Implementation Plan was organized around five service areas that were subdivided into 37 different\nstrategies. Each strategy is implemented through one or more programs that provide services for clients.\nServices are delivered either through County-based programs or through community-based programs\ncontracted by the County.

Outcome Evaluation to assess the effect of MIDD strategies on MIDD policy goals\nperformed, output measures, output targets, outcome measures and data sources. In addition, the\nEvaluation Targets Addendum of the Evaluation Plan specifies targets for four of the five MiDD policy\ngoals the King County Council sought to achieve with MIDD funding. The targets were based on the\nlength of time until a program would be fully implemented and information from programs serving\n similar populations across the country.\nThe following sections provide more detail about the three main components of the Evaluation Plan.\n1.SystemProcessEvaluation\nThe objectives of the System Process Evaluation are to describe how the implementation of MiDD is\nprogressing, to identify unintended consequences of MIDD activities, and to establish a quality\nimprovement feed-back loop to inform revisions to MiDD processes and strategies. In particular, the\nprocess evaluation component of the plan focuses on:\n Initial MIDD start-up activities\nDevelopment and management of requests for proposal and service contracts\nStrategies to leverage and blend funding streams\nApril 14, 2016\nFinal Report\n33",

Examples include\nassociated with mental health illness and risk factors impacting families and youth served by MiDD. The\nselected distal outcome measures reflect behavior and address jail utilization, emergency room visits\nand hospital use, that is, MiDD policy goals (1) through (4).\nMIDD Evaluation Reporting\nOrdinance 15949 also specified what type of evaluation reporting would occur and when.\n\"In addition to reviewing and approving the parts one, two and three of the oversight, implementation\nexecutive shall submit four quarterly progress reports and an one annual summary report for the\nApril 14, 2016\nFinal Report\n34",

It requires that:\n\"...the evaluation plan shall describe an evaluation and reporting plan for the\nprograms funded with the sales tax revenue. Part three [the Evaluation Plan]\nshall specify: process and outcome evaluation components; a proposed schedule\nfor evaluations; performance measurements and performance measurement\ntargets; and data elements that will be used for reporting and evaluations.\nThe primary goal of the MIDD is to:\ncriminal justice and emergency medical systems and promote recovery for\npersons with disabling mental illness and chemical dependency by implementing\na full continuum of treatment, housing, and case management services.\nThe Ordinance identified five policy goals:\n1. A reduction in the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent people\n2. A reduction in the number of people who recycle through the jail, returning\nrepeatedly as a result of their mental illness or chemical dependency\n3. A reduction of the incidence and severity of chemical dependency and mental\nand emotional disorders in youth and adults\ninitial or further justice system involvement\n5. Explicit linkage with, and furthering the work of, other council directed\nefforts including, the A dult and Juvenile Justice Operational Master plans, the\nPlan to End Homelessness, the Veterans and Human Services Levy Service\nImprovement Plan and the King County Mental Health Recovery Plan.\nIn the MIDD Action Plan, the MIDD Oversight Committee, the Mental Health, Chemical\nA buse and Dependency Services Division (MHCA DSD) and its stakeholders identified\nsixteen core strategies and corresponding sub-strategies (see A ppendix for a list and\ndescription of strategies) for service improvement, enhancement and expansion to\naddress these goals.

Results from the ongoing\nevaluation will be regularly reported on though quarterly and annual reports that will be\nreviewed by the MIDD Oversight Committee and transmitted to the King County\nExecutive and Metropolitan King County Council. It also should be noted that the\nEvaluation Plan will evolve and change as the strategies evolve and change. Changes to\nthe Evaluation Plan will be included in the regular reports as described above.\nOVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATIONPLAN\nMIDD Framework\nThe MID D Evaluation Plan establishes a framework for evaluating each of the 16 core\nstrategies and sub-strategies in the MID D Implementation Plan, by measuring what is\ndone (output), how it is done (process), and the effects of what is done (outcome).\nMeasuring what is done entails determining if the service has occurred. Measuring how\nmonitoring, as well as process and outcome evaluation to determine if a program is being\nimplemented as intended. Measuring the effects of what is done is also complex, and will\nrequire the use of both basic quantitative and qualitative methods as appropriate\nThe evaluation framework ties the MIDD goals and strategies to the MID D results. It\nfunds, and how those results will contribute to realizing the MIDD goals and objectives.\nThe schematic diagram below shows the high level relationships between the components\nof the framework.\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 2 of 10",

Multiple and oftentimes interrelated interventions are\n designed to achieve the policy goals (e.g., reducing caseloads, increasing funding,\nenhancing workforce development activities and service capacity are expected to\ncollectively reduce incarceration and use of emergency services). Many of the outcomes\nexpected from the MID D interventions are highly correlated to each other. For example,\na decrease in mental health symptoms can lead to a decrease in crisis episodes, which can\nlead to a decrease in incarcerations, which can lead to an increase in housing stability,\nwhich can lead to a further decrease in mental health symptoms, and so on. Interventions\nthat have an impact on any one of these outcomes can therefore be expected to have some\nimpact on the other outcomes. The specifics of each intervention and the population it is\ntargeting will determine which outcome(s) will be impacted in the short-term and how\nmuch additional time will be necessary before other longer-term outcomes will be seen.\n(Examples of longer term outcomes include reduction in jail recidivism and/or re-\nhospitalizations, or prevention of substance abuse in children of substance abusing\nparents.)\n1. Process Evaluation\nThe first component of the MIDD evaluation is a process evaluation that will assess\nhow the MIDD is being implemented at both the system and strategy levels.\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\n Page 3 of 10",
    "Page_78": "King County\nMental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan\nA. System Process Evaluation\nThe system process evaluation will provide a general assessment of how\nstatus report', this type of evaluation may also answer specific programmatic\nquestions (e. g., “How can we improve the quality of training for chemical\ndependency specialists?\").\nThe system process evaluation will examine:\n● Initial startup activities (e.g., acquiring space, hiring and training staff,\ndeveloping policies and procedures)\ncontracts for services\n· Strategies to leverage and blend multiple funding streams\n Efforts to coordinate the work of partners, stakeholders, and providers\n· Implementation of working agreements and Memoranda of\nUnderstanding\nService-level changes that occur as the result of efforts to promote\nintegration of housing, treatment, and supportive services\nSystems-level changes that occur as a result of the use of MIDD funds or\nthe management of MID D related resources\n●An evaluation of the MIDD Action Plan's integration with and support of\nsystem level goals and objectives, as articulated in the A dult and Juvenile\nVeterans and Human Services Levy Service Improvement Plan and the\nKing County Mental Health Recovery Plan.\nThe goal of the system process evaluation is not only to capture what actually\nhappens as the MIDD is implemented, but also to identify the unintended\nconsequences of MID D activities (e.g., circumstances that were not anticipated or\nwere unusual in ways that helped or hindered MID D-related work).\nThe system process evaluation establishes a quality improvement feedback loop\nin order to make any needed mid-course adjustments. Evaluation activities will\nincrease opportunities to learn about and practice service and system integration\nstrategies.\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 4 of 10",
    "Page_79": "King County\nMental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan\nB. Strategy Process Evaluation\nIn addition to the system process evaluation, evaluation at the strategy level will\nmeasure performance and assess progress toward meeting specified performance\ngoals. These performance measures and goals are specified as outputs in the\n2.Outcome Evaluation\nThe outcome evaluation will assess the impact of the funded services and programs\non the MIDD goals. This approach consists of evaluating the full range of program\noutcomes in the context of a logical framework. The evaluation matrix designed for\nthis part of the evaluation links the MIDD goals and strategies to the MIDD results\nand provides a structure for identifying performance indicators, targets and data\nsources, and for collecting and reporting results.\nThe MID D outcome evaluation is broader than a program evaluation or a series of\nprogram and helps demonstrate how these outcomes individually and collectively\ncontribute to the achievement of the overall goals of the MIDD.\nA. Strategies\nEvaluating the impact of the MIDD Action Plan is a multifaceted endeavor.\nThere are multiple target populations, goals, strategies, programs, interventions,\nproviders, administrators, partners, locations, timelines, and expected results. The\ncomprehensive evaluation strategy is designed to demonstrate whether the\nexpected results are being achieved and whether value is returmed on MID D\ninvestments.\nUnderlying principles for the outcome evaluation include:\n·The evaluation will build upon existing evaluation activities and\ncoordinate with current and/or developing information systems (e.g.,\nStrategy 7b, expanded Children's Crisis Outreach Response System).\n?\n W hen the implementation of a strategy will take multiple years, making it\nimpossible to immediately demonstrate any long-term outcomes, the\nevaluation will establish intermediate outcomes to show that the strategy\nChildren of Substance Abusers)\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 5 of 10",

The MIDD evaluation will utilize the\nstrongest and also the most feasible evaluation design for each strategy.\n·An evaluation that requires a control group to prove that a program is the\ncause of any effects can be expensive and time consuming. In general, it\nwill not be possible for an evaluation of most MIDD programs to include\na control or comparison group to show a causal relationship. Establishing\na control or comparison group would require that some individuals not\nreceive services so that they can be compared with those who receive\nservices. However, there may be situations when a‘natural' comparison\ngroup may be used if feasible.\n· A proven program, such as an evidence-based practice, has already had an\nstrategies fund practices and services that are currently working or have\nbeen proven to work elsewhere, there is no need to again prove a causal\nrelationship. Instead, the evaluation will focus on measuring the quantity\nfidelity measures.\n● For many strategies a proven program and/or best practice will be\nsubstantially modified in order to be useful to the specific populations\ntargeted by the MID D. Evaluation of these programs will stress on-going\nmonitoring and early feedback so that any necessary changes can take\nmarker of which longer-term desired outcomes are likely to be detected.\nThis formative type of evaluation will help ensure that the program is\nfunctioning as intended.\nB. Evaluation Matrix\nOrganizing an evaluation as complex as this requires a systematic approach. An\nevaluation matrix has been designed for compiling the needed information for\neach sub-strategy. Completed evaluation matrices for each sub-strategy specify\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 6 of 10",

Baseline\ninformation about the target population and their use of services will be obtained.\nTo provide results related to racial disproportionality and cultural competency,\ndata about race, ethnicity, and language will also be collected. Some of the data\ncan be obtained immediately from existing sources such as the King County\nRegional Support Network database, Safe Harbors, and TARGET (the state\n Division of Alcohol and Substance Abuse database).

When strategies are further developed or modified\nfollowing initial implementation, new or revised outcomes will be developed, and\nincluded in the quarterly reports.\nADDENDUM: EVALUATION APPROACH\nThe MIDD Evaluation Plan was developed in the context of existing quality management\napproaches currently utilized by the Department of Community and Human Services\n(DCHS) and the Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division\n(MHCADSD). MHCADSD is responsible for the publicly funded mental health and\nsubstance abuse treatment systems, and as such is obligated to assure the quality,\nappropriateness, availability and cost effectiveness of treatment services. MHCA DSD\nmust demonstrate to federal, state, and county government the capacity to operate and\nmonitor a complex network of service providers. This is accomplished through well-\nestablished quality assurance and improvement strategies, including contract\ndevelopment and monitoring, setting expectations for performance, conducting periodic\nreview of performance, and offering continuous feedback to providers regarding\nsuccesses and needed improvements. In that context, all MIDD contracts will specify\nwhat the provider is expected to do, including service provision, data submission, and\nreporting of key deliverables. The MIDD evaluation will extend beyond the contract\nmonitoring process to assess whether services were performed effectively, and whether\nthey resulted in improved outcomes for the individuals involved in those services.\nwhose collective experience with program evaluation, performance measurement;\nresearch, and quality improvement is summarized in A ttachment B. The MHCA D SD\nSystem Performance Evaluation team will continue to provide leadership and staffing to\nassure that the evaluation proceeds in a timely and transparent manner. The ongoing\nevaluation of the MID D will involve coordination with MIDD Oversight Committee,\nstakeholders, providers, and other agencies responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of\nrelated or overlapping programs (Veteran's and Human Services Levy Service\nImprovement Plan, Committee to End Homelessness, Public Health of Seattle/King\nCounty, United W ay Blueprint to End Chronic Homelessness, City of Seattle, University\nof W ashington, etc.).\nThe Evaluation Plan and the evaluation matrices for each individual strategy were\ndeveloped directly from the individual implementation strategies. Some strategies are\nstill in the process of being developed; therefore the evaluation matrices for those\nstrategies will need to be revised as plans are finalized. Updates to the Evaluation Plan\nwill be included in the quarterly, bi-annual, and annual reports reviewed by the MID D\nOversight Committee and transmitted to the King County Executive and Metropolitan\nMIDD EvaluationPlan\nPage 9 of 10",

The Plan utilizes a basic approach to evaluation: measure what is\ndone (output), how it is done (process), and the effects of what is done (outcome)\n·Measuring what is done is usually straightforward, as it entails determining if the\nservice has occurred. For example, Strategy 1d aims to increase access to “next\nday appointments for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. The\nevaluation will determine whether the program met its target of increasing\navailability of next day appointments for an additional 750 people.\n· Measuring how an intervention is done is more complex and may involve a\ncombination of contract monitoring (MHCADSD contract staff review agency\npolicies and procedures, client charts, staff credentials, billing, etc.), and process\n and outcome evaluation to determine if a program is being implemented as\nintended.\n· Measuring the effects of what is done can vary in complexity.

As identified in County Ordinance 15949, the outcomes presented here are\nexplicitly linked to the following MID D policy goals:\n0 A reduction in the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent\npeople using costly interventions like jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals\n0 A reduction in the number of people who recycle through the jail\ndependency\n0Diversion of mentally ill and chemically dependent youth and adults from\ninitial or further justice system involvement\nTargets for the broad MIDD policy goals were established based on the assumption that a\nset of programs has been up and running for one full year and has enrolled enough\nparticipants to detect significant changes. The programs within the MiDD strategies will\nbuild on each other and also improve over time and as such, targets will change over\nprograms have been in operation. We have therefore developed targets that change over\nline.\nWe have based the development of our outcome targets on information we have from\nprograms serving populations similar to those served by MIDD, and on program results\nfrom similar programs across the country. There are, however, a number of factors that\ncannot be predicted but may directly influence whether the anticipated targets are\nachieved. Factors such as changes in law enforcement policies and funding, significant\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 12 of 10",

Furthermore, there are a number of local and state initiatives that\ndirectly influence outcomes associated with the MID D. For example, the MacA rthur\nModels for Change Initiative is focusing on juvenile justice reform; the King County\nSystems Integration Initiative is addressing issues of coordination, collaboration, and\nblending resources for multi-system youth; and the Ten-year Plan to End Homelessness\nand the Veterans and Human Services Levy are working to increase the availability of\nhousing and services for homeless individuals. Consistent with the fifth policy goal, the\nMID D Evaluation will track coordination and linkage with these other Council directed\nefforts through a process evaluation.\nBaseline Data\nIn some cases, sufficient baseline data for some of the subsets of the five policy goals\nacross all of King County does not exist. Such baseline data will be established during\nthe first year of full strategy implementation. Data sharing agreements will be executed\nensure accurate baseline estimates and to continue to collect such data on an ongoing\nbasis to monitor targeted outcomes. For example, baseline data on particular populations\nwill include youth with mental health disorders in King County Juvenile Detention and\nadults with SMI in jails across King County.\nMonitoring and Evaluation\nMonitoring and evaluation results will be used to support quality improvements and\nrevisions to MID D strategies, to highlight successes, and to demonstrate cost\neffectiveness to the taxpayer.\nMonitoring outcomes at short-term, intermediate, and long-term phases will allow us to\nmake changes in program implementation based on the targeted outcomes.\nAs programs in the MIDD Implementation Plan are implemented and evolve over time\nthe Evaluation Plan will be updated accordingly to accurately measure the effectiveness\nand impact of each individual strategy.\nprobability that the relationship between variables (e.g., MID D program and an outcome)\nis due to chance?

The PSS is an inventory used to assess the functioning\nlevel for adults in a number of life domains. Scores on the clinician-rated\ninstrument are assigned to each dimension from O - Above Average:\nArea of strength relative to average to 5 - Extreme impairment: Out of\ncontrol, unacceptable. The PSS assesses 14 dimensions, including\nsymptoms of depression, anxiety, psychosis (thought disorders), and\ndissociation (unreality).

    "Page_127": "Appendix L\n Unmet Annual Performance Measurement Targets and Supplantation Programs Receiving MIDD Funding\nPrior to 2016\n Of the 37 original MIDD strategies, 19 (51%) had annual performance measurement targets that were\nunmet at least one time between 2008 and 2015.
