The EPA National Exposure\nResearch Laboratory, which dem onstrates field sam pling, m onitoring, and measurementtechnologies, selected Science\ndevices for mercury in soil and sediment. This demonstration was funded by the SiTE Program.\nDEMONSTRATIONDESCRIPTION\ndevices for mercury in soil and sediment. This verification statement focuses on the RA-915+/RP-91C; a similar\nstatement has been prepared for each of the other four devices. The performance of the RA-915+/RP-91C was\ncompared to that of an off-site laboratory using the reference method, “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste\" (SW-\n846) Method 7471B (modified). To verify a wide range of perform ance attributes, the demonstration had both primary\nand secondary objectives. The primary objectives were:\n(1) Determining the instrument sensitivity with respect to the Method Detection Limit (MDL) and Practical\nQuantitation Limit (PQL);\nili",

The field sam ples were\ncollected in four areas contam inated with mercury, the spiked samples were from these same locations, and the PE\nsamples were obtained from a commercial provider.\nmercury needed to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the RA-915+/RP-91C. A complete description of the\ndemonstration and a summary of the results are available in the Innovative Technology Verification Report: “Field\n(EPA/600/R-03/147).\nTECHNOLOGYDESCRIPTION\nThe RA-915+ Mercury Analyzer is a portable AA spectrometer with a 10-meter (m) multipath optical cell and Zeeman\nbackground correction. Mercury is detected without preliminary accum ulation on a gold trap. Mercury samples are\nin test cell for field performance verification. The operation of the RA-915+ is based on the principle of differential,\ninterferences and provides the highest sensitivity. A mercury lamp is placed in a permanent magnetic field in which the\nabsorption cell and through the test cell. In the absence of mercury vapors, the intensity of the two o com ponents are\nequal. When mercury vapor is presentin the absorption cell, mercury atoms cause a proportional, concentration-related \nvapor\" technique.

Individual samples were mixed manually\nusing a quartz injection spoon.

Key\ndem onstration findings are sum marized below for the primary objectives.\nSensitivity: The two primary sensitivity evaluations performed for this demonstration were the MDL and PQL. Both\nwill vary dependent upon whether the matrix is a soil, waste, or aqueous solution. Only soils/sediments were tested\nduring this demonstration, and therefore, MDL calculations and PQL determinations for this evaluation are limited to\nthose matrices. By definition, values measured below the PQL should not be considered accurate or precise and those\nbelow the MDL are not distinguishable from background noise.\nMethod Detection Limit - The evaluation of an MDL requires seven different measurements of a low concentration\nstandard or sample following the procedures established in the 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 136. The\nMDL is estimated between 0.0053 and 0.042 mg/kg. The equivalent MDL for the referee laboratory is 0.0026 mg/kg.\nPractical Quantitation Limit - The low standard calculations using MDL values suggest that a PQL for the Ohio Lumex\nfield instrument may be as low as 0.027mg/kg (5 times the lowest calculated MDL). The %D for the average Ohio\nwas the lowest sample concentration tested during the demonstration that is close to but not below, the calculated PQL\nnoted above. The referee laboratory PQL confirmed during the demonstration is 0.005 mg/kg with a %D <10%.\nand to the referee laboratory results (Method 7471B). The Ohio Lumex data were within SRM 95% prediction intervals\nLumex field data and the referee laboratory results suggest that the two data sets are not the same.

Ohio Lumex data were found\nnumber of Ohio Lumex average values less than 30% different from the referee laboratory results or SRM reference\nvalues was significant - 19 of 33 different sample lots. Ohio Lumex results therefore, provide accurate estimates for\nfield determination. Because the Ohio Lumex data compare favorably to the SRM values, the differences between Ohio\nLumex and the referee laboratory are likely the result of reasons beyond the scope of this study.\nPrecision: The precision ofthe Ohio Lumex field instrument is better than the referee laboratory precision.

Operation requires one field technician with\na basic knowledge of chemistry acquired on the job or in a university and training on the instrument.\nPotential Health and Safety Concerns: No significant health and safety concerns were noted during the\ndemonstration. The only potential health and safety concerns identified were the generation of mercury vapors and the\npotential for burns with careless handling of hot quartz sample boats. The vendor provides a mercury filter as standard\nequipment; exercising caution and good laboratory practices can mitigate the potential for burns.\nPortability: The RA-915+ air analyzer was easily portable, although the device, even when carried in the canvas sling,\nwas not considered light-weight.
