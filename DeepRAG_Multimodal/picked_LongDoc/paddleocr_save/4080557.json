The\nadoption of these revised Standards and Interpretations has resulted in changes to the Group's\naccounting policies in the following areas:\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation (IAS32)\nNATIONAL\nINSURANCE\nCORPORATION\nFinancial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS39)\nlation\n61",

The effective\ninterest rate method is the method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or\nliability and of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.\nWhen calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all\ncontractual terms of the financial instrument, but does not consider future credit losses.\nOnce a financial asset or group of financial assets has been written down as a result of an\nimpairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount\nthe future cash flows for the purpose of measuring impairment loss.\n(h) Dividend Income\nDividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recorded in the Statement of Income\nand Expenditure when the entities right to receive the payment is established.\n(i)Development Fees\nDevelopment fees are included in the project cost and are recognized as income over the\nNATIONAL\nlives of the projects on a pro rata basis.\nINSURANCE\nCORPORATION\nworking together with pride to build our nation\n 64",

A provision for impairment of accounts receivable is\nestablished when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all\namounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.\nThe amount of the provisions is the difference between the assets' carrying amount and\nthe present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.\nThe amount of the provision is recognised in the Income and Expenditure Statement.\n(m) Finance Lease\nThe asset held as a finance lease is recognised as a receivable and finance income is\nbased on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment\noutstanding in respect of the finance lease.\n(n) Financial Assets\nThe Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:\nLoans and Advances\nHeld-to-Maturity Investments and \nAvailable-for-sale financial assets.\nNATIONAL\nINSURANCE\nCORPORATION\n65",

Were the Group to sell other than an\ninsignificant amount of the held to maturity assets, the entire category would be\ntainted and reclassified as available-for-sale.\nAvailable-for-Sale\nAvailable-for-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period\nof time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest\nrate, exchange rate or equity prices.\nPurchases and sales of financial assets held-to-maturity and available-for-sale are\nrecognised on trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the\nasset.\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction cost.

A financial asset or a group of\nfinancial assets is impaired if there is objective evidence that the loss has occurred after\nthe initial recognition of the asset and has an impact on the ability of management to\nreliably estimate future cash flows of the financial asset or group of assets.\nThe Group assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets\nthat are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that\nare not significant.\nImpairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence that impairment loss on held-\nto-maturity investments carried at amortised cost has been incurred or that the Group will\nnot be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the\nloans. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the carrying\namount of the asset and the recoverable amount being the present value of the estimated\nfuture cash flows (excluding future credit losses which have not been incurred)\ndiscounted at the financial asset's original effective rate.\nThe carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of the provision for loan\nimpairment. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the provision for loan impairment\nin the Statement of Income and Expenditure.\nThe methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed\nregularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss\nexperience.\nThe Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that\nfinancial assets carried at fair value is impaired.
