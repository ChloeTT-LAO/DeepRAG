Every citywide office is on the ballot, including Mayor. As usual, the\nEric Adams (Brooklyn Borough President), Shaun Donovan (former Secretary of Housing and\nUrban Development and director of the Office of Management and Budget under President\nObama), Kathryn Garcia (former Sanitation Commissioner under Mayor de Blasio), Ray\nMcG uire (former Vice-chair of Citigroup), Dianne Morales (former Executive Director and CEO\nof social-services nonprofit Phipps Neighborhoods), Scott Stringer (New Y ork City Comptroller),\nMaya Wiley (civil rights lawyer and activist; former counsel to Mayor de Blasio), and Andrew\nY ang (entrepreneur; former presidential candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary). In addition,\nthere are two Republican candidates: Fernando Mateo (President of the New York State\nFederation of Taxi Drivers and spokesperson for the United Bodegas of America) and Curtis\nSliwa (founder and CEO of the Guardian Angels and radio-talk-show host). Profiles for all the\ncandidates are included in Appendix B.\nRegardless of who wins, current NY C Mayor Bill de Blasio's successor will need to deal with the\npandemic's aftermath, as well the unprecedented economic disruption it has wrought on New\nY orkers and the City. A mong the many policy decisions the new mayor must make will be those\naffecting transportation—or, as it has been variously referred to by the candidates, the “central\nStreets\" to traffic congestion, Vision Zero, aggressive emissions and climate-change goals, the\nwill be tighter and tough decisions will need to be made about which transportation policies the\nCity will pursue.\nFor the mayoral election in 2013, the University Transportation Research Center (\"UTRC\") at\nThe City College of New Y ork (CCNY ), of the City University of New Y ork (CUNY ), issued a\nreport entitled the “Mayoral Election Transportation Policy & Issue Primer: Candidates′\n    a    sn      r   s\nmayoral primary election summarizing the leading candidates’ positions on key issues impacting\ntransportation. The purpose of this report is to educate voters on important transportation issues\nand the candidates’ stances on the issues that matter to New Y orkers.\nLike 2013, for the 2021 report, the UTRC again convened a NYC Mayoral Election\nTransportation Policy Advisory Committee, which was formed to advise and assist in the\npreparation of this report, and which was chaired and led by the author of this report, UTRC\nTransportation Technology Chair Matthew W.

The survey was limited to the top ten questions as selected by the A dvisory\nCommittee from a repository of more than 50 questions. Each candidate identified in this report\nwas given an opportunity to respond. Each candidate's positions are summarized in tables within\nthis report and included along with the candidate's profile in Appendix B.\nThe author and the Advisory Committee identified the transportation topics addressed in this\nreport. The report covers an array of transportation topics that the next mayor will or could face\nwhen governing New Y ork City, from hot topics like busways and bike lanes to more niche issues\nlike commuter vans and taxi stands. W hile it is important for voters to understand these issues, it\nis not reasonable to expect candidates to form positions on every issue, and candidates have not\ntaken a position on important issues recognized by experts.\nThe report is not exhaustive and does not attempt to amass each and every utterance, thought, and\nstatement of the candidates throughout their careers. However, this report is a useful tool to help\nvoters understand where candidates stand on many issues and how the candidates may handle\nsimilar issues if elected. To further assist voters, the report includes a Transportation Policy\nVoter E-Palm Card in Appendix A of that sets forth highlights of the candidates’ positions,\nproposed policies, and plans they have in the transportation realm.\nRegardless of who wins the election, it is our hope that this report will form the basis for the\nwinning primary candidates - and the next mayor of NY C - to benefit from the ideas of their\ncolleagues in the race. W hile only two of the primary candidates will win here, NY C and everyone\nwins if the candidates’ ideas, as detailed in this report, can become new and innovative\ntransportation policies ideas that are debated by the Democratic and Republican candidates from\nnow until the General Election in November 2021. We would ask the next mayor of NY C to\nconsider the ideas of his or her former opponents, as well as the suggested transportation policy\npriorities outlined by the UTRC and its Advisory Committee, as the next administration and our\nCity embark on a path to recovery and resiliency.\n{11935670:1}",

In the update from NY TWA, the debt forgiveness plan was further detailed to\nask lenders to set the term of the loans to not exceed 20 years, with a fixed 4% interest\nrate and a monthly payment of $757 per month. The plan language makes it clear that\nlenders are not mandated to restructure loans\n·Loan Guarantee: In returmn for forgiving the debt, the plan calls on the City to\n\"backstop” the loans in the debt forgiveness plan to incentivize the lenders to\nrestructure the medallion loans. Based on the plan, the City's guarantees of the loans\nshould not exceed $75 million. This would be the equivalent of 600 loans with a\n$125,000 balance. There is no further information from the NY TWA or other reports\nin support of calculating the City's exposure.\n· Medallion Loan Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. Rep. Gregory Meeks introduced H.R.\n2077 on March 19, 2021 (this bill was H.R. 5167 in the last Congress). This legislation\nwould provide some financial relief for taxi medallion owners by not considering debt\nforgiveness they receive as income. This bill excludes from gross income, forincome\ntax purposes, the income of a taxpayer, other than a C corporation, attributable to the\ndischarge of qualified taxi medallion indebtedness. When this legislation was first\nannounced in January 2020, then-Congressman Peter King and Signature Bank\nNYC congressional delegation and has bipartisan support. Given the change of\nleadership in the U.S. Senate in 2021, this legislation may move forward in the months\nahead in the 117th Congress, and there is no reason to believe President Biden would\nnot sign the legislation.\n· Foreclosed Medallions: The NYTWA has asked lenders to include foreclosed\nmedallions in this plan. In other words, the medallion owner would be able to refinance\nfor the same terms with a $125,000 medallion loan cap and “take back' the medallions.\nd) The Medallion Asset Relief Program (*\"MARP\"): This is a proposal initially made by then-\nS           \nPresident Obama's Home Affordable Refinance Program (\"HARP\"), which was released in\nMarch 2009, to allow homeowners with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80% to refinance\nwithout also paying for mortgage insurance.

In September 2020, Torres clarified MA RP would only cover the medallions\nowned by the 6,250 medallion owner-drivers, and the fleets that own 20 or fewer\nmedallions.

Since the City would guarantee the loans (see below),\nTorres expects lenders would reduce their interest rates as well.\n· Mandates: The program contemplates a mandate for the medallion valuation.

Today, only 25% of\nits 472 subway stations are ADA accessible.28 Some of these stations are accessible only in one\ndirection.

Early proposals\nfor congestion pricing put recommended prices of $12 to $14 for cars and $25 for trucks, and a\nJune 2020 study from Cornell University found that $20 toll for entering Manhattan below 60th\nStreet could reduce air pollution by 40% in New Y ork City. Congestion tolls were estimated to\ngenerate $1 billion in annual revenue to help fund MTA construction work. For every $1 billion\nexpected in toll revenue per year, the MTA can obtain $5 billion in bonding over the next three\nyears.\nBecause the roads that would be tolled receive federal funding, the Federal Highway\nAdministration (*\"FHWA\") required an environmental review before New York State could\nimplement congestion pricing. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of guidance from\nfederal regulators on the type of environmental review that was required (full environmental\nimpact statement or abbreviated assessment) caused the project to be stalled. In March 2021, the\nBiden administration informed the MTA that it could submit an environmental assessment instead\nof an environmental impact statement - a welcome development for proponents of congestion\npricing.\nHowever, politically difficult decisions will have to be made before the tolling infrastructure can\nbe installed. The 2019 law stipulated that the board of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel A uthority\n(TBTA) would determine the charges and exemptions, credits, or discounts for any group of\ndrivers, including taxis and ride-hailing vehicles.
