Located just north of the\nBow River and Downtown, these communities are collectively known as the North Hill Communities\n(Figure 2: Plan Context). The Plan takes a multi-community approach that recognizes and builds upon\n the shared assets and features that connect these inner-city and established communities including \ninfrastructure, recreational amenities, public parks and open spaces, Main Streets, corridors, transit \nstation areas and Activity Centres. The nine communities and Greenview Industrial have their own\nunique history and evolution which is detailed in Section 1.3.\nRealizing the Plan's vision will depend on several factors such as population growth, economic\nconsiderations and development trends. The Plan is meant to be updated periodically as development\nand change occur.\nFigure 2:Plan Context\nNORTH HILL\nCOMMUNITIES\nLOCAL AREAPLAN\n6\n1 Visualizing Growth\nNorthHill CommunitiesLocalAreaPlan",

Noise exposure forecast (NEF)\ncontours of the AVPA generally impact the eastern portion of the plan area, specifically Greenview Industrial. Properties\nwithin these areas are subject to certain development restrictions and/or conditions as identified in the regulation.\nFreight Rail Corridor\nA Canadian Pacific (CP) rail corridor runs through the eastern part of the plan area. Any development adjacent to\nfreight rail corridors must comply with the requirements of the Development Next to Freight Rail Corridors Policy, in\naddition to any other applicable policies.\nLandfill Setback\nThere is a non-operating landfill located to the south of the plan area in Bridgeland-Riverside.
