Throughout Earth's his-\n, e e  b s   s  \nhouse\" state to the current \"icehouse\" state [Frakes et al. 1992]. If we trust in\nfuture climate projections, we have to understand the underlying driving mech-\nobservations and geological climate reconstructions is essential.\nSimulating the climate of the past considerably depends on the choice of\nboundary conditions. For example, incorporating time scales of Earth-orbital\nchanges, natural variations in atmospheric CO2, or tectonic activity that are of\norder 104 to 107 years is beyond feasibility for general circulation models whose\nscales, therefore, needs to be prescribed as boundary condition for the time slice\nof interest [e.g., Saltzman 2002].\nThe long-term cooling trend throughout the Cenozoic era, that is the last 65\nmillion years (Ma), is driven by tectonic events and a large decline in atmo-\nspheric CO2 [Zachos et al. 2001]. However, the long-term cooling trend was\ninterrupted by periods of gradual warming, for example during the Early Eocene\nat ~50 Ma, the Late Oligocene at ~25 Ma, and the Middle Miocene at ~15 Ma.\n1",
    "Page_14": "1.Introduction\nDuring the Middle Miocene, midlatitude temperatures were 6-7 K warmer than\ntoday [Flower and Kennett 1994, Mosbrugger et al. 2005], the climate was more\nhumid [B ohme et al. 2011], and the equator-to-pole temperature gradient was re-\nduced both overland and ocean [Nikolaev 2006, Bruch et al. 2007]. At the same\n[Pearson and Palmer 2o0o]. Because of the warm climate under relatively low\nCO2, the Middle Miocene has been described as a period in which CO2 and tem-\nperature were decoupled [KÃ¼rschner et al. 2008]. However, estimates of atmo-\nspheric CO2 are highly uncertain for the Middle Miocene and range from lower\nthan pre-industrial values [Pagani et al. 1999] to up to twice the pre-industrial\nvalues [K urschner et al. 2008].\nDuring the last two years, the Middle Miocene warm climate achieved more\nattention in the palaeoclimate modelling community either due to uncertainties\nin atmospheric CO2 [Tong et al. 2009, You et al. 2009], ocean gateway config-\nurations, continental elevation, or vegetation [Henrot et al. 2010]. Until now,\n gradient, and the lack of a dynamic ocean model led researchers to conclude that\noceanic control has to be important in regulating the redistribution of heat from\nlow to high latitudes [e.g., Pagani et al. 1999, Henrot et al. 2010]. This leads us\nnaturally to the first research question of the thesis:\n(1) Can a dynamic ocean contribute to a warm Middle Miocene\nclimate and reduce the equator-to-pole temperature gradient?\nFor the first time, we shed light on the role of the ocean for the Middle\nMiocene climate in a set of experiments with the coupled atmosphere-ocean-\nbiosphere model MPI-ESM (Max Planck Institute Earth System Model). In our\nbasic experimental setup, we apply a realistic Middle Miocene topography that\naccounts for several ocean gateways that were open during the Middle Miocene,\nfor example, Panama Seaway and Tethys Ocean [Herold et al. 2008]. As is\ntraditional, we simulate the climate mean state, but we also want to constrain\nuncertainties of atmospheric CO2 reconstructions, which leads us to our second\nresearch question:\n2",
    "Page_15": "(2) Can we model the warm Middle Miocene climate under mod-\nern atmospheric CO2 and what is the effect of higher CO2?\nIt is not necessarily true that the spatial and temporal structure of cou-\npled ocean-atmosphere modes is independent of the climatological mean state\n[Roberts and Battisti 2011], and few studies exist that thoroughly describe the\nnatural variability of the ocean-atmosphere system for palaeoclimates. Because\n           \nnamely also about climate variability, we investigate the most prominent mode\nof climate variability, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon\nin a case study for the Middle Miocene. Our next research question, therefore,\nis:\n(3) What is the effect of Middle Miocene boundary conditions\non the El Nino-Southem Oscillation, in particular open ocean\ngateways and higher CO2 levels?\nPalaeoclimate modelling for deep times requires appropriate tectonic bound-\nary conditions due to the long time scales of tectonic events (106-107 years),\nwhich cannot be resolved by current coupled climate models. To overcome un-\ncertainties of underlying topographic boundary conditions, sensitivity experi-\nments test the effect on the climate system [e.g., Ruddiman and Kutzbach 1989].\nThe Middle Miocene, as the time slice of interest, involves two geological fea-\ntures whose appearance may alter the ocean circulation in the Atlantic: (1)\nthe Greenland-Scotland Ridge that separates the Nordic Seas from the Atlantic\ntion under different climate conditions has been widely disputed [e.g., Broecker\net al. 1985], leading us to our final research question:\n(4) What is the effect of ocean gateways and ridges on deep water\nWith our last study, we address the sensitivity of Atlantic Ocean circulation to\ntopographic boundary conditions with a reintegration of the Greenland-Scotland\n3",

The climate in Europe was warmer and more humid\n[Bohme et al. 2011, Bruch et al. 2010]. Even in the Sahara region, conditions\nwere humid, and desert regions were far less extended than today [Senut et al\n2009]. The continents were densely wooded; evergreen forests expanded to at\nleast 45Â° N, and boreal forest expanded northward as far as the Arctic circle\n[Wolfe 1985, Williams et al. 2008].\nReconstructions for atmospheric CO2 levels estimate values between\n180 ppm and 550 ppm [Pagani et al. 1999, Royer et al. 2001, Kurschner et al.\n2008]. Translated into radiative forcing, the uncertainty accounts for about\n2.6W m-2 for the direct effect of CO2 only [Myhre et al. 1998]. In a re-\ncent model study, the possible range of atmospheric CO2 levels for the Middle\nMiocene was suggested to be between 460 and 580 ppm [You et al. 2009].\nPrevious modelling studies for the Middle Miocene used atmosphere gen-\neral circulation models (GCMs) with either prescribed sea surface temperatures\n(SSTs) or a mixed-layer 0cean [You et al. 2009, Tong et al. 2009, Herold et al.\n2010].

What these studies have in common is that they lack the dy-\nchanges such as mountain uplift, but they cannot account for oceanic gateway re-\nconfigurations and associated changes in circulation, heat, and freshwater trans-\nport.

We test if the results with the full ocean\ndynamics are consistent with previous modelling studies, and if we can improve\nthe meridional temperature gradient mismatch. Therefore, we do a series of\na warm Middle Miocene climate, and how higher than present-day CO2 levels\ncontribute to a warm Middle Miocene climate.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2.2 describes the setup of our\nclimates appear in Section 2.3. The dynamics behind the ocean and atmospheric\nheat transports are discussed in Section 2.4, and changes of the large-scale ocean\ncirculation are the matter of interest in Section 2.5. In Section 2.6, we compare\nour results to marine and terrestrial temperature reconstructions. Section 2.7\ngives a summary and a discussion on our main findings. We conclude in Sec-\ntion 2.8.\n2.2 Model setup and experimental design\nWe use the atmosphere-ocean-biosphere general circulation model MPI-ESM.\nIt is a comprehensive Earth-System Model that has been developed at the Max-\nPlanck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. The dynamical core of the atmo-\nsphere model ECHAM5 is formulated in spherical harmonics [Roeckner et al\n7",
    "Page_20": "2. The modelled Middle Miocene climate\n2003]. We use ECHAM5 in a T42 truncation, which corresponds to a hori-\nzontal grid spacing of 2.8Â°. ECHAM5 has 19 levels in the vertical, the upper\nmost being at 10 hPa. ECHA M5 incorporates the land surface model JSBACH\nthat includes a dynamic vegetation module [Raddatz et al. 2007, Brovkin et al\n2009]. In JSBACH, each grid cell is divided into tiles, which are covered with\n          \netation dynamics in JSBACH are based on the assumption that different PFTs\ncompete in terms of their annual net primary production, their natural, and their\ndisturbance-driven mortality [for details, see B rovkin et al. 2009]. JSBACH can,\ntherefore, account for temporal and spatial changes of the land-surface albedo\n2003] uses a tripolar curvilinear grid with a quasi-homogeneous horizontal grid\nspacing of about 1Â°.

MPI-OM incorporates\na dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice model that follows the descriptions of Hibler\n   a a     \nmomentum flux, heat flux, and freshwater flux, as well as sea surface temper\natures, sea-ice thickness, sea-ice area fraction, and snow cover on sea ice once\nper day via OA SIS [Valcke 2006].\nThe palaeotopography is based on a global plate rotation model, and the palaeo.\nwith overlaid sediment thicknesses [Herold et al. 2008]. Uncertainties for this\nreconstructed topography are largest in the mountain regions of the Andes, the\nRocky Mountains, and the Tibetan Plateau. Furthermore, the seafloor is rela-\ntively smooth compared to present day due to the lack of geological data [for\ndetails, see Herold et al. 2008]. In contrast to present day, several ocean gate-\nways connect the major ocean basins, for example, the open Panama Seaway,\nthe Tethys, and a wider Indonesian Through-flow. The atmospheric circulation\nis also affected by the topography because large mountain regions like the An-\ndes, the Himalayas, the Rocky Mountains, and the Alps are lower compared to\n8",

The overall decrease over the Southern Hemisphere is mainly due to\na reduction in convective precipitation (Figure 2.2b). In MIOC480, precipita-\nitation decreases 0ver the tropics in both MI0C480 and MI0C720 due to less\ncloud cover (Figure 2.2c), whereupon an overall reduction is in line with a future\nglobal warming [Trenberth and Fasullo 2009].\nLand cover changes\nThe important factors that determine the vegetation cover are radiation, precip-\nitation, and atmospheric CO2. Changes in these climate parameters lead to re-\nsponses of the vegetation cover that affect the climate system in terms of surface\nalbedo, roughness length, moisture and heat fluxes, or runoff. In our experi-\nmental setups, we intentionally change the topography and prescribe higher than\npresent atmospheric CO2 levels. While the topography changes the local radi-\nation balance and shifts precipitation patterns, an enhanced hydrological cycle\nand a stronger greenhouse effect can be attributed to higher CO2.\nVegetation starts to occupy regions where the land ice has been removed,\nfor example over Greenland (Figure 2.5). High-latitude warming and higher\nCO2 levels support a northward expansion of boreal forests. In MI0C480 and\nMIOC720, global forest coveris largest (Table 2.2, Figure 2.5c and d). The large\nforest cover and the northward extension of forest is in line with vegetation re-\nconstructions [Wolfe 1985]. Unfortunately, the vegetation module in JSBACH\ncannot account for changes in soil properties, like field capacity or background\nalbedo. They have to be prescribed with present-day values.

    "Page_52": "3. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation in the Middle Miocene climate\n3.1Introduction\nThe El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest and most prominent\ninterannual climate mode. ENSO is a complex interaction between ocean and\nback between trade winds and the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient,\nwhich is known as Bjerknes feedback [Bjerknes 1969]. Westward blowing trade\nwinds pile up warm surface water toward the west, tilting the thermocline down-\nward from east to west. The deep thermocline at the west is known as westerm\nPacific \"warm pool.\" Coastal upwelling and equatorial upwelling due to Ekman\ndrift produce the \"cold tongue\" at the eastern Pacific. The circulation that is\ndriven by the zonal temperature gradient between the warm pool and the cold\ntongue is called Walker circulation. Warm and moist air rises over the western\nPacific warm pool and leads to low surface pressure. The rising air reaches the\ntropopause and returns eastward, where it subsides. The eastern Pacific high\n pressure reinforces the trade winds and completes the Walker circulation.\nAlthough the term ENSO includes the word oscillator, the phenomenon\nneeds not necessarily be understood as oscillating between positive and nega-\ntive phases. Analysis of real climate ENSO showed that ENSO behaves more\nlike a series of single events rather than a cycle [Kessler 2002].\nThere is evidence for persisting ENSO variability during past warm climates.\n3-5 million years old corals from the tropical Pacific resemble interannual vari-\nability on ENSO time scales [Watanabe et al. 2011]. This proxy record seems to\nend the long-lasting debate about the \"permanent El Nino\" during the Pliocene\n[e.g., Molnar and Cane 2002, Fedorov et al. 2006]. Forthe Late Miocene (~5.6\n     s    (  \nsemble the modern spectrum of ENSO [Galeotti et al. 2010]. Located in the\nMediterranean, the authors assigned the variability to the tropical Pacific be\ncause of ENSO teleconnections, which might have been stronger during the Late\nMiocene due to a reduced meridional temperature gradient. A Late Miocene\nrecord from giant clams, 10-13 million years ago, also shows ENSO-like inter\nannual variability [B atenburg et al. 2011]. Another recent study for the Eocene\n\"hothouse\" climate shows that shells from long-living bivalves as well as drift-\nwood from A ntarctica reflect interannual variability on ENSO time scales [Ivany\n40",

    "Page_94": "4. Northern Component Water formation and its effect on the A MOC\nConcerning the role of the GSR and associated overflows in controlling the\nsubpolar gyre, we propose the following: The direct effect of wind stress on\noverflows is less important than thermohaline forcing [e.g., Hansen and Oster-\nhus 2000]. Assuming that wind stress anomalies refer to short-time variations\nand thermohaline forcing to longer oceanic time scales, we hypothesise that\noverflows introduce more low frequency variability in the sense of Hasselmann\n[1976] due to their integral response to small-scale fluctuations. A box-model\napproach for Denmark Strait overflows by KÃ¤se [2006] also showed that the\noverflow response to stochastic forcing is red noise.\nA recent study with a coarse-resolution model showed that the subpolar gyre\nis sensitive to overflows through baroclinic adjustments [Born et al. 2009].

Although topography can alter the strength of the\nAMOC, we do not find a severe slow-down of the AMOC as has been shown\nfor the Pliocene period, where the Panama Seaway was still open [Lunt et al.\n2007]. We propose the following: If we assume that the Antarctic Circumpo-\nlar Current (ACC) and the associated wind-driven upwelling is the first-order\ndriving mechanism for the global thermohaline circulation and the northward\ntransport of Atlantic water is a nearly passive consequence [Wunsch 2002], a\nstable Middle Miocene A MOC is simply an implication of the ACC, which is as\nstrong as today in the Middle Miocene experiments (not shown). A recent proxy\nstudy also provides evidence that the moderm ocean structure is a consequence of\nACC development during early Oligocene [Katz et al. 2011]. This supports our\nfindings that NCW formation resembles present-day conditions and that the dis-\ntribution of NCW is similarto the modern distribution of NA DW.

We show that the topography of the Nordic Seas has implications for heat\ntransport at high latitudes. A nomalous heat transport, especially at high\nlatitudes, may alter conditions for sea-ice growth on intraseasonal and in-\nterannual time scales. An open question is how Nordic Seas topography\ninfluences the susceptibility of seasonal or perennial sea-ice cover to vari-\nations in poleward heat transport anomalies.
