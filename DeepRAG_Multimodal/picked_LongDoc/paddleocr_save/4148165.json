HISTORY OF THE IN-SERVICE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR\nThe current policy toward in-service conscientious objectors is the latest\nwho, because of their religious beliefs, conscientiously oppose military service. The\nhistory of the in-service conscientious objector, as contrasted with the conscientious\nobjector to compelled or conscripted service, is relatively short. Nevertheless, even\nthough the in-service conscientious objector program is recent, it shares the heritage of\ncompulsory military service. Reviewing the history of this tradition serves two purposes\nin this paper. This history demonstrates the development of the nation's policy of\naccommodating conscientious objection to compelled military service. This history also\ndemonstrates the limitations Congress consistently sought to impose on any exemption\n  s  e  s  s d  s\nconscientious objector.

The Court describes its task in a statutory\ninterpretation case much as Justice Harlan described it in his concurrence in Welsh. The\nCourt has noted, \"Our task is to give effect to the will of Congress, and where that will\nhas been expressed in reasonably plain terms, that language must ordinarily be regarded\nas conclusive.\"151 Justice Black paid scant attention to the will of Congress, preferring\ninstead to rely on his own understanding of religion.\nThe concept of \"religious training and belief\" is not foreign to the American\nexperience. The common-sense understanding of the term indicates that religion means\nmore than a personal moral code or a standard of ethical conduct. By drawing on this\nunderstanding and linking the statutory term with the specific language Congress\nincluded in the statute to advise what was not included in the term, one can find a\ncomprehensible standard.152 This definitional chore is even clearer given the record of\ncongressional disapproval of the Seeger standard.\nOn the other hand, because both Seeger and Welsh involved interpretations of the\n1948 Act, the Supreme Court was not necessarily required to interpret the amended\nlanguage of the 1967 Act to resolve either case.

Consequences of an Overinclusive Standard\nThe overinclusive standard for \"religious training and belief' developed in Seeger\nand Welsh resulted in four sets of adverse consequences. First, the Seeger-Welsh\nstandard gives the irrational result that a standard which requires religious beliefs may\nnot distinguish between secular and religious beliefs. Second, the Seeger-Welsh standard\nin several ways fosters unfairness or the perception of injustice in the administration of\nthe in-service conscientious objector program.

Finally, what amounts to a standardless standard poses several practical\ndifficulties to the military as it administers the in-service conscientious objector program\na. The Irrational Outcome Consequence\nThe Court in Seeger and Welsh took a statutory standard that required religious\nbetween religious and secular beliefs in the area of ethics, philosophy, and personal\nmoral codes. One commentator concluded, \"Now the conscientious objector exemption\nmight be forbidden only to the lukewarm and opportune. All others, regardless of their\n153 See Sullivan, supra note 85, at 757.\n49",

This language would have excluded beliefs that were not linked by reference to\na Supreme Being, as well as beliefs that were \"essentially political, sociological or\nphilosophical\" or that constituted a \"personal moral code.\"iss The Seeger-Welsh standard,\nhowever, would define these beliefs as \"religion\" as long as the claimant held them\ndeeply and sincerely.\nThe Court itself implicitly recognized the counterintuitive outcome of its newly\ndeclared standard. Justice Black stated that a claimant's own characterization of his\nbeliefs as \"nonreligious\" was a \"highly unreliable guide\" to the factfinder.156 Under\nnormal circumstances, one would consider the claimant to be the most competent to\nidentify his belief system as religious or not. These are, however, far from normal\ncircumstances. Justice Black apparently concluded that the world of conscientious\nobjection lies far beyond the ken of the ordinary claimant of conscientious objector\nstatus.

The advent of a volunteer\nforce and the restructuring of the United States armed forces and national security\nstrategy following the end of the Cold War require a reassessment of the Seeger-Welsh\nstandard not only for the fairness issue discussed above, but also for the potential\nmilitary readiness impacts of an overbroad standard.\nThe impact of personnel losses because of an in-service conscientious objector\nobjector exemption only from conscripted military service.

Addressing the Fairness Issue of the \"Benefiting Conscientious\nObjector\" - Alternative Service\nThe remaining issue deserving careful consideration is the fairness problem posed\nby the conscientious objector who seeks a discharge after receiving the benefit of\ngraduate-level or other significant education or professional training at the military's\nexpense. A soldier receiving such training incurs a military service obligation of a\nperiod of years.2?7 The current in-service conscientious objector policy grants this\nFunded Legal Education Program); id. & 2005 (outlining the service obligation arising\nfrom the advanced educational assistance program); id. $ 2114 (outlining the service\nobligation arising from attendance at the Uniformed Services University of Health\nSciences); id. $ 2123 (outlining the service obligation arising from participation in the\narising from participation in the Reserve Component Health Care Professional Financial\nAssistance program).\n93",

The current policy\nwas shaped, in part, by external forces and national interests that no longer exist.

The in-\nservice conscientious objector program must be restructured to meet the needs of the\nnation and its military as they exist today.\nA. Necessity for an In-service Conscientious Objector Program\nAn in-service conscientious objector program serves three enduring purposes,\neven in an all-volunteer military. Recognizing and excusing religious conscientious\nobjectors from military service continues a long national tradition rising from a national\ncommitment to religious freedom, individual liberty, and democratic pluralism.\nProviding an in-service conscientious objector program also recognizes the reality that\ncoercing military service from a person whose deeply held religious beliefs forbid such\nservice will seldom make a good soldier. Finally, an in-service conscientious objector\nprogram acknowledges the reality that people grow and change throughout their lives.\nThese changes can include changes in a soldier's fundamental belief systems that can, in\nturn, lead to conflict with that soldier's continued military service. For these reasons,\nthe Department of Defense ought to continue a program to accommodate the needs of\nthe in-service conscientious objector.\nB. Necessity for Change in the Current Program\nThe current in-service conscientious objector program serves a need, but also\ncarries within it several fundamental flaws. The program is burdened with standards\n98",
