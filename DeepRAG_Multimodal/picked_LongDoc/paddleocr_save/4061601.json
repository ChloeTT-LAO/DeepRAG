Amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nBasis ofPresentation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TCPL and its subsidiaries. The Company consolidates its interest in\nentities over which it is able to exercise control. To the extent there are interests owned by other parties, these interests are\nproportionate share of undivided interests in certain assets. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to\ncurrent year presentation.\nUse of Estimates and Judgments\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, TCPL is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the\non future events. The Company uses the most current information available and exercises careful judgment in making these\nestimates and assumptions. Significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements\ninclude, but are not limited to:\nfair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination (Note 5)\nfair value and depreciation rates of plant, property and equipment (Note 8)\n carrying value of regulatory assets and liabilities (Note 10)\nfair value of goodwill (Note 11)\nfair value of intangible assets (Note 12)\ncarrying value of asset retirement obligations (Note 15)\nprovisions for income taxes (Note 16)\n fair value of financial instruments (Note 24) and\n·\n provision for commitments, contingencies, guarantees (Note 27) and restructuring (Note 28)\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\nRegulation\nIn Canada, regulated natural gas pipelines and liquids pipelines are subject to the authority of the National Energy Board (NEB). In\nthe U.S., natural gas pipelines, liquids pipelines and regulated natural gas storage assets are subject to the authority of the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In Mexico, natural gas pipelines are subject to the authority of the Energy Regulatory\nconstruction, operations and the determination of tolls. Rate-regulated accounting (RRA) standards may impact the timing of the\nrecognition of certain revenues and expenses in TCPL's rate-regulated businesses which may differ from that otherwise expected in\nnon-rate-regulated businesses to appropriately reflect the economic impact of the regulators' decisions regarding revenues and\ntolls. TCPL's businesses that apply RRA currently include Canadian, U.S. and Mexican natural gas pipelines, regulated U.S. natural\n decisions regarding operations and tolls on that system generally do not have an impact on timing of recognition of revenues\nand expenses.\nRevenue Recognition\nNatural Gas Pipelines and Liquids Pipelines\nTransportation\nRevenues from the Company's natural gas and liquids pipelines, with the exception of Canadian natural gas pipelines which are\nof the amount of natural gas or crude oil that is transported.

A VIE is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional\nthe entity's operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a variable interest and for which it is considered to\nbe the primary beneficiary. VIEs in which the Company has a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for\n as equity investments.\nConsolidated VIEs\nThe Company's consolidated VIEs consist of legal entities where the Company is the primary beneficiary. As the primary\nbeneficiary, the Company has the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact economic performance including purchasing or selling significant assets; maintenance and operations of assets; incurring \nto absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the consolidated ViE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nA significant portion of the Company's assets are held through ViEs in which the Company holds a 100 per cent voting interest,\nthe VIE meets the definition of a business and the VIE's assets can be used for general corporate purposes.
