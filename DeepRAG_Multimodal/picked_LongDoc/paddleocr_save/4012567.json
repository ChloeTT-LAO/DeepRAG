J ohnson in 1968. The Federal Fair\nHousing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on a person's race, color, religion,\ngender, disability, familial status, or national origin. Persons protected from\ndiscrimination by fair housing laws are referred to as “members of the protected classes\".\nP rotected class members under the Federal Fair Housing Act are protected “on the basis\nof race/ethnicity, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, and national origin\". In\naddition, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a Final\nRule on February 3, 2012 that prohibits entitlement communities, public housing\nauthorities, and other recipients of federal housing resources from discriminating on the\nbasis of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.\nThis Analysis of Impediments (Al) is a review of demographic data, metrics of\ndiscrimination and disparity, local regulations and administrative policies, procedures,\nalso assesses the conditions where housing is located, both public and private, along\nwith public policies and regulations that affect fair housing choice.\nA city-wide analysis and discussion on the trends and issues relating to housing\n4",

Therefore, impediments to fair housing choice may be linked to acts\nthat violate a law or acts or conditions that do not violate a law but preclude people with\nvarying incomes from having equal access to decent, safe, and affordable housing.\nThe first part of this section, Section 3.1, will address existing statutory and case law that\nresulted in removal of impediments and served to promote fair housing choice. Statutory\nand case law pertaining to interpretation and enforcement of the F ederal Fair Housing\nAct can be effective in mitigating barriers to fair housing choice, depending upon\nenforcement efforts, judicial and administrative court rulings. Relevant landmark judicial\ncourt case decisions pertaining to fair housing were reviewed and are incorporated in the\nanalysis.

To make this determination, the City of Mesquite\nstatues were compared to the F ederal Fair Housing Act to determine whether they offered\nsimilar rights, remedies, and enforcement to the federal law and based on that evaluation,\nwhether the Mesquite Ordinance has enacted local legislation that can be construed as\nenacted substantially equivalent Fair Housing Law to the Federal Fair Housing Act.\nPertinent related laws, such as the Community Reinvestment Act and Home Mortgage\nDisclosure Act, were reviewed with respect to how they facilitate fair lending.

Loan\napplications and originations were even when compared to their percentage in\norigination rates from minorities and the disproportionate loan denials rates\nbetween Whites andsome minority populations.One possible explanation for\nlower loan originations among minorities could be a lack of credit history, poor\ncredit history, or higher debt-to-income ratio. During 2019, the majority of loan\ndenials for all applicants were related to the applicants' credit history.\nWhile our analysis does not provide conclusive evidence of redlining, the data tend\nto suggest that some characteristics of redlining may exist and therefore impacting\nlending decisions and higher denial rates in some of the very low-income census\ntracts in Mesquite.
