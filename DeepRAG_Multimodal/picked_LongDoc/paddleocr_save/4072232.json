We began with the set of priorities that were previously listed on the Laurel WiD website2 (water\nquality and water rights).\n2. We reviewed all Laurel WiD board meeting minutes back to January 2015? to collect relevant\nstatements and decisions made by the WlD board and grouped those statements or decisions into\nrepresentation; water quality; w ater quantity; water rights).\n 3. We added priorities identified in the February 2016 work session and described in the Laurel WID\nAgriculture-Watershed Characterization and M apping Report4 (habitats and species; water flow\nprocesses; agricultural land protection).\n 4. The list of priorities and potential priority actions was revised after the WiD Work Session held in\nLynden on M arch 20th, 2017.\n 5. We built a master spreadsheet listing the main priorities that had been identified and discussed by\nthe WID in all of the various processes mentioned above. Where the WID board had also discussed\nor decided on near-term actions associated with a priority, we included those in the spreadsheet. The\nmaster spreadsheet is available as an electronic document and provides the raw material for the\nsuggested priorities described in this section.\nnear-term actions using draft wording drawn from previous WiD documents, statements and\ndecisions (see Table 2 below). The material in these tables serves as a starting point around which\nthe WID board could build their M anagement Plan and associated actions.\n 7. We also compared the list of WiD priorities to relevant policy statements and goals in two related\nplanning documents, namely the Whatcom County Comprehensive Plan (2016 update)5 and the\nWRlA1 Watershed M anagement Project's statement of goals (2008).Â° The goal statements in these\ntwo planning documents offer additional context for the Laurel wiD's own priorities, and are shown\nalongside the suggested W ID priorities in Appendix D.\n8. We attended the Tenmile Watershed Forum held at the W hatcom Conservation District on 1 M arch\n2018, and added information from that event to the tables of suggested priorities, and to the section\n 2.2  Suggested priorities and desired outcomes for the Laurel WID\nEach agreed strategic priority should ideally have one or more desired outcomes attached to it, which\nwould then be used to:\nÂ· establish measurable goals against which progress can be measured and reported regularly, and\nÂ· identify actions, an implementation schedule, scope of work and resources needed for\nimplementation (see Table 2).\n2 See https:// www.laurelwid.com/projects\n3 See https://www.laurelwid.com/minutes\n(ewuns annaxa todai buddew aim) suawnoop sun yo  xuadda aas t \n5 Whatcom County Comprehensive Plan, adopted August 2016. htp://wa-whatcomcounty.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/21056\n6 WRIA1 Watershed M anagement Project (2008).

Her account describes the M yers family raising dairy cows, growing grass for pasture and hay;\nand potatoes. M arion Myers, her grandfather, became one of the first chicken farmers in Whatcom\nplanted nearly ten acres of fruit trees.62 The author's account of her maternal grandparents' farm in the\nTenmile area, which they purchased in 1903, includes horses, cows, a pig, chickens, geese, and Belgian\nto store \"potatoes, apples, carrots, onions, or other garden produce.\"63 In the 1890s, there were 30 to 40\n orchards within a four-mile radius of Ferndale, and the cannery and condensery industries grew.64\nJeffcott (1949) provides some insight into the rapid expansion of agriculture in the nearby Ferndale area\nwith his brief account of David R. Henderson who arrived in Whatcom County in 1873.
