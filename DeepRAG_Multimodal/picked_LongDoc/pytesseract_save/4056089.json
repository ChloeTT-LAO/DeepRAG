The Condominium Home Owners\nAssociation recommends, and most Strata Corporations in B.C. have such a By-Law, as it\nwould not be fair for those who have not contributed towards operating expenses, to have\na vote as to how the Strata's funds may or may not be expended.\n\ne There was counter argument from several of the Owners that there were extenuating\ncircumstances, as it appeared that the square footages having been measured as \"habitable\narea\" for the purposes of the Strata Plan filed at the Land Titles Office may not agree\nwith the actual as built amounts.\n\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING MINUTES - STRATA PLAN VIS 4810 - MARCH 3, 2004 3\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 5",
