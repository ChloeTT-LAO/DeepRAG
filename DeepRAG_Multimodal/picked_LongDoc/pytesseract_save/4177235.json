In spite of its importance, the mass\nbalance (the net volumetric gain or loss) of the Antarctic ice sheet is poorly known; it is not known\nexactly whether the ice sheet is growing or shrinking. Changes in the area and volume of the polar\nice sheets are strictly linked to global changes and could result in sea-level variation that would\nseverely affect the densely populated coastal regions on the Earth.\n\nVelocity of ice-streams is a critical parameter, which, together with ice thickness, allows the\ndetermination of ice discharge rates; this information is however in large part not available, or only\npartially available for the last years, and can be mainly provided by using remote sensing\ntechnologies and techniques.\n\nAntarctica is the only continent which has still to be fully explored [144]. Because of its\ngeographical position and physical characteristics, together with the distance from sources of\npollution and the almost total absence of anthropic disturbance, Antarctica provides us with a\nunique opportunity to obtain data for a global knowledge of the planet [144]. Antarctica is perhaps\nthe continent in which the nations respond more freely to the need for common research\nprogrammes. A Treaty was signed in Washington on December Ist 1959 by the 12 countries\nparticipating in the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958); the Treaty covers the area south of\n60°S latitude. Its objectives are simple yet unique in international relations, being:\n\n- to demilitarize Antarctica, to establish it as a zone free of nuclear tests and the disposal of\nradioactive waste, and to ensure that it is used for peaceful purposes only;\n\n- to promote international scientific cooperation in Antarctica;\n- to set aside disputes over territorial sovereignty.\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty remains in force indefinitely. The success of the Treaty has been the growth in\nmembership. Forty six countries, comprising around 80% of the world’s population, have acceded\nto it. Consultative (voting) status is open to all countries who have demonstrated their commitment\nto the Antarctic by conducting significant research.\n\nIn the context of the research in Antarctica, Italian contribution is developed by the Italian National\nAntarctic Research Programme (Programma Nazionale di Ricerca in Antartide, PNRA), active\nsince 1985 with an expedition every year. The research Programme includes many disciplines:\nEarth Sciences, Atmosphere Physics, Cosmology, Biology and Medicine, Oceanography,\nEnvironmental Sciences, Technology. During its development, the Programme increasingly\naddressed the study of global phenomena inside the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the geosphere.\n\nPNRA has its main base at Mario Zucchelli Station in Terra Nova Bay, lying between Cape\nWashington and the Drygalski Ice Tongue along the coast of Victoria Land. Logistic and research\nfacilities allow there the execution of activities in the main research fields and in the framework of\nmajor international projects. Other important research activities are carried out at the Concordia\nStation, recently completed in collaboration with France, built 3233 m above sea level at a location\ncalled Dome C on the Antarctic Plateau; Concordia Station is located 1200 kilometres inland from\nMario Zucchelli Station. This site was chosen by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica\n(EPICA) for deep ice core drilling, with the aim to obtain the longest undisturbed chronicle of\nenvironmental change, in order to characterise climate variability over several glacial cycles.\nDrilling was completed in December 2004, reaching a drilling depth of 3270.2 m; the core goes\nback 740000 years and reveals 8 previous glacial cycles.\n\ni",
    "Page_9": "2007-2008 has been appointed as the International Polar Year. Since the first International Polar\nYear in 1882-83 there have been a number of major international science initiatives in Polar\nRegions and all have had a major influence in providing a better understanding of global processes\nin these areas. These initiatives have involved an intense period of interdisciplinary research,\ncollecting a broad range of measurements that provide a snapshot in time of the state of the polar\nregions. As mentioned, a fundamental moment was the International Geophysical Year 1957-58,\ninvolving 80000 scientists from 67 countries: it produced new explorations and discoveries in many\nfields of research and changed in a fundamental manner how science was conducted in the polar\nregions. Fifty years on, technological developments such as growing availability of earth\nobservation satellites, autonomous vehicles and molecular biology techniques offer enormous\nopportunities for a further step in our understanding of polar systems.\n\nThe International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008, actually running from March 2007 to March 2009,\nis then an international programme of coordinated, interdisciplinary scientific research and\nobservations in the Earth's polar regions with the aim to:\n\n- explore new scientific frontiers;\n- deepen our understanding of polar processes and their global linkages;\n\n- increase our ability to detect changes, to attract and develop the next generation of polar scientists,\nengineers and logistics experts;\n\n- capture the interest of schoolchildren, the public and decision-makers.\nFocus areas of IPY campaigns are Atmosphere, Ice, Land, Oceans, People, Space.\n\nOne might ask what are or what will be the advantages of the research activities performed in\nAntarctica, considering the financial effort they require. The answer is essentially \"knowledge\".\nResearch activity does not necessarily engender immediate tangible results. The product is the\noutcome of slow maturation and derives from the combination of results obtained by the various\ncountries in the various sectors of research.\n\n \n\nThe introduction of the Thesis focus on the Global Change problem and the linkage with ice flows\nbehaviour in polar regions. Chapter 2 describes remote sensing observation of ice sheets and\nglaciers and their characterization. Third chapter describes the most utilized approaches to the\ndetermination of ice motion. Chapter 4 and 5 are related to the study of an ice flow (David glacier)\ncarried out by a multitemporal analysis developed using imagery coming from different sensors\n(MSS, TM, ETM+, ASTER, HRVIR) on board of different satellites (Landsat, Terra and Spot). The\nimages were acquired from 1973 to 2006 and the scenes cover about 200 km of the coastal zone in\nVictoria Land (Terra Nova Bay); the major glaciers of Victoria Land flow into this bay. Mario\nZucchelli Station, formerly known as Terra Nova Bay Station, is located along the coast of the\nnorthern foothills between the Campbell and Drygalski glacier tongues.\n\nThe study, mainly concentrated on the monitoring of David glacier, seeks to develop a methodology\naiming to reach the following objectives:\n\n- multisensor satellite data integration using image cross-correlation techniques, in order to measure\nice displacements;\n\n- enhancement of measurement precision by image processing techniques and filtering\nmethodologies, also applying GIS techniques;\n\n- accuracy assessment and comparison with the results obtained using different methods and\nsurveying techniques.",

    "Page_13": "Chapter 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough the Earth system is constantly changing, ozone depletion, increases in atmospheric\ngreenhouse gases, large-scale pollution and changing patterns of natural resource use demonstrate\nthat human activities are altering the Earth system at an accelerated pace. Awareness of this has led\nto an evolving international consensus on the importance of both increasing our scientific\nunderstanding of global change and linking scientific findings to policy decisions [139].\n\nClimate change is one of the most critical global challenges of our time. Recent events have\nemphatically demonstrated our growing vulnerability to climate change. Climate change impacts\nwill range from affecting agriculture, further endangering food security, sea-level rise and the\naccelerated erosion of coastal zones, increasing intensity of natural disasters, species extinction and\nthe spread of vector-borne diseases [145]. In recent usage, especially in the context of\nenvironmental policy, the term \"climate change\" often refers to changes in modern climate,\nconsequences of global warming phenomenon, that represents the increase in the average\ntemperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans in recent decades (Figure 1./) and its\nprojected continuation (Figure 1.5) [129]. In common usage, the term refers to recent warming and\nimplies a human influence [50]. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC) uses the term \"climate change\" for human-caused change, and \"climate variability\" for\nother changes [111]. The term \"anthropogenic global warming\" is sometimes used when focusing\non human-induced changes.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific body tasked to evaluate the\nrisk of climate change caused by human activity [129]. The panel was established in 1988 by the\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP), two organizations of the United Nations. IPCC concludes \"most of the observed increase\nin globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed\nincrease in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations\"[47] via the greenhouse effect (Figure\n1.2). The greenhouse effect is the process in which the emission of infrared radiation by the\natmosphere warms a planet's surface. The name comes from an incorrect analogy with the warming\nof air inside a greenhouse compared to the air outside the greenhouse [129]. The Earth's average\nsurface temperature of 15 °C is about 33 °C warmer than it would be without the greenhouse effect\n[48]. Understanding global warming requires understanding the changes in climate forcings that\nhave occurred since the industrial revolution. These include positive forcing from increased\ngreenhouse gases, negative forcing from increased sulphate aerosols and poorly constrained\nforcings from indirect aerosol feedbacks as well as minor contributions from solar variability and\nother factors. The poorly constrained aerosol effects results from both limited physical\nunderstanding of how aerosols interact with the atmosphere and limited knowledge of aerosol\nconcentrations during the pre-industrial period. Contrary to the impression given by Figure 1.3, it is\nnot possible to simply sum the radiative forcing contributions from all sources and obtain a total\nforcing. This is because different forcing terms can interact to either amplify or interfere with each\nother. For example, in the case of greenhouse gases, two different gases may share the same\nabsorption bands thus partially limiting their effectiveness when taken in combination. This is a",

    "Page_15": "Figure 1.4 shows the variations in concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere during\nthe last 400 thousand years. Throughout most of the record, the largest changes can be related to\nglacial/interglacial cycles within the current ice age. Although the glacial cycles are most directly\ncaused by changes in the Earth's orbit (i.e. Milankovitch cycles), these changes also influence the\ncarbon cycle, which in turn feeds back into the glacial system. Since the Industrial Revolution, circa\n1800, the burning of fossil fuels has caused a dramatic increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, reaching\nlevels unprecedented in the last 400 thousand years. This increase has been implicated as a primary\ncause of global warming.\n\nNatural phenomena such as solar variation combined with volcanoes probably had a small warming\neffect from pre-industrial times to 1950 and a small cooling effect from 1950 onward [44][1]. These\nbasic conclusions have been endorsed by at least 30 scientific societies and academies of science\n[106], including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries\n[99][97][89]. While individual scientists have voiced disagreement with some findings of the IPCC\n[81], the overwhelming majority of scientists working on climate change agree with the IPCC's\nmain conclusions [98][107].\n\n \n\n \n\nThe global average air temperature near the Earth's surface rose 0.74 + 0.18°C (1.33 + 0.32°F)\nduring the 100 years ending in 2005 [47]. Climate model projections summarized by the IPCC\nindicate that average global surface temperature will likely rise a further 1.1 to 6.4°C (2.0 to 11.5°F)\nduring the 21st century [47]. The range of values results from the use of differing scenarios of\nfuture greenhouse gas emissions as well as models with differing climate sensitivity.\n\nAlthough most studies focus on the period up to 2100, warming and sea level rise are expected to\ncontinue for more than a thousand years even if greenhouse gas levels are stabilized. The delay in\nreaching equilibrium is a result of the large heat capacity of the oceans [85]. Figure 1.5 shows a\nprojection of the geographic distribution of surface warming during the 21st century from Hadley\nCentre HadCM3 climate model [143]. As can be expected from their lower specific heat, continents\nwarm more rapidly than the oceans in the model with an average of 4.2°C to 2.5°C respectively.\nThe lowest predicted warming is 0.55°C south of South America, and the highest is 9.2°C in the\nArctic Ocean (points exceeding 8°C are plotted as black). This model is fairly homogeneous except\nfor strong warming around the Arctic Ocean related to melting sea ice and strong warming in South\nAmerica related predicted changes in the El Nifio cycle, that is part of a interannual cycle called\nENSO (EI Nino, Southern Oscillation) which occurs in the tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean (El\nNino is the warm part of this cycle. It occurs once every 3 to 7 years).\n\nIncreasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation, which leads to more precipitation [47].\nAs average global temperatures have risen, average global precipitation has also increased.\nAccording to the IPCC, the following precipitation trends have been observed:\n\ne Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900-2005, but has\nmostly declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically\nsignificant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have widely by\nregion and over time.\n\nelt has become significantly wetter in eastern parts of North and South America, northern\nEurope, and northern and central Asia, but drier in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern\nAfrica and parts of southern Asia.\n\ne Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by freshening of\nmid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in\nlow-latitude waters (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation).\n\ne There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas\n\nduring the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts\nespecially in the tropics and subtropics.",

    "Page_17": "In the Northern Hemisphere's mid- and high latitudes, the precipitation trends are consistent with\nclimate model simulations that predict an increase in precipitation due to human-induced warming\n[141]. By contrast, the degree to which human influences have been responsible for any variations\nin tropical precipitation patterns is not well understood or agreed upon, as climate models often\ndiffer in their regional projections [47].\n\nIncreasing dramatic weather catastrophes are due to an increase in the number of severe events\n(Figure 1.6) and an increase in population densities, which increase the number of people affected\nand damage caused by an event of given severity. The World Meteorological Organization [16] and\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection.\n\nAgency [110] have linked increasing extreme weather events to global warming, as have Hoyos et\nal. (2006), writing that the increasing number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes is directly linked to\nincreasing temperatures [45]. Similarly, Kerry Emmanuel in Nature writes that hurricane power\ndissipation is highly correlated with temperature, reflecting global warming. Hurricane modeling\nhas produced similar results, finding that hurricanes, simulated under warmer, high CO2 conditions,\nare more intense than under present-day conditions.\n\nThomas Knutson and Robert E.Tuleya of the NOAA stated in 2004 that warming induced by\ngreenhouse gas may lead to increasing occurrence of highly destructive category-5 storms [108].\nVecchi and Soden find that wind shear, the increase of which acts to inhibit tropical cyclones, also\nchanges in model-projections of global warming. There are projected increases of wind shear in the\ntropical Atlantic and East Pacific associated with the deceleration of the Walker circulation, as well\nas decreases of wind shear in the western and central Pacific[114]. The study does not make claims\nabout the net effect on Atlantic and East Pacific hurricanes of the warming and moistening\natmospheres, and the model-projected increases in Atlantic wind shear [114].\n\nIncreasing global temperature will cause sea level to rise. Sea-level has risen about 130 metres (400\nft) since the peak of the last ice age about 18,000 years ago. Most of the rise occurred before 6,000\nyears ago. From 3,000 years ago to the start of the 19th century sea level was almost constant, rising\nat 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr.[50] Since 1900 the level has risen at 1 to 2 mm/yr; since 1993 satellite\naltimetry from TOPEX/Poseidon indicates a rate of rise of 3.1 + 0.7 mm yr-1 [15]. Church and\nWhite (2006) found a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th\ncentury rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 +0.3 mm per yr and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of\n0.013 + 0.006 mm per year per yr. If this acceleration remains constant, then the 1990 to 2100 rise\nwould range from 280 to 340 mm,[15].\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7 shows the change in annually averaged sea level at 23 geologically stable tide gauge\nsites with long-term records as selected by Douglas (1997) [19]. The thick dark line is a three-year\nmoving average of the instrumental records. This data indicates a sea level rise of ~18.5 cm from\n1900-2000. Because of the limited geographic coverage of these records, it is not obvious whether\nthe apparent decadal fluctuations represent true variations in global sea level or merely variations\nacross regions that are not resolved. For comparison, the recent annually averaged satellite altimetry\ndata [19] from TOPEX/Poseidon are shown in red.\n\nThese data indicate a somewhat higher rate of increase than tide gauge data, however the source of\nthis discrepancy is not obvious.\n\nChanges in global climate and sea level are intricately linked to changes in the area and volume of\npolar ice sheets [72].\n\nDuring the most recent glacial maximum, about 18,000 years ago, the total volume of ice was about\n2.5 times, and the total area about three times, their present values [28] with the consequence that\nsea level was about 125m below its present level [23].

    "Page_19": "120,000 years ago, sea level was about 6m higher than today, and it is possible that the Greenland\nice sheet largely disappeared [63]. The Little Ice Age was a period from about 1550 to 1850 when\nthe world experienced relatively cooler temperatures compared to the present. Until about 1940,\nglaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed. Glacial retreat slowed and even reversed,\nin many cases, between 1950 and 1980 as a slight global cooling occurred. However, since 1980 a\nsignificant global warming has led to glacier retreat becoming increasingly rapid and ubiquitous, so\nmuch so that some glaciers have disappeared altogether, and the existence of a great number of the\nremaining glaciers of the world is threatened. In locations such as the Andes of South America and\nHimalayas in Asia, the demise of glaciers in these regions will have potential impact on water\nsupplies. The retreat of mountain glaciers, notably in western North America, Asia, the Alps,\nIndonesia and Africa, and tropical and subtropical regions of South America, has been used to\nprovide qualitative evidence for the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century [51][82].\n\nThe recent substantial retreat and an acceleration of the rate of retreat since 1995 of a number of\nkey outlet glaciers of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, may foreshadow a rise in sea\nlevel, having a potentially dramatic effect on coastal regions worldwide [129]. Other large-scale\nphenomena that may be associated with global climate change include the possible destabilization\nand disintegration of the Antarctic ice shelves unstable [86]. Dramatic calving events (breaking\naway of ice) have been monitored [91]. In particular, it has been suggested that the West Antarctic\nice sheet may be using satellite data. The Larsen ice shelf has been retreating since the 1940s,\nincreasingly rapidly since about 1975 (Figure 1.8). Major calvings have occurred since 1986 [96],\nassociated with acceleration of the glaciers that formerly fed the ice shelf, and the retreat is\nprobably now irreversible [18] [102].\n\nThe respective communities have begun to communicate, linking their datasets to provide an\nimportant basis to assess ongoing climate and glacier change, and to develop realistic scenarios for\nfuture conditions and challenges in glacierised mountain regions [104]. Fluctuations of glaciers and\nice caps have been systematically observed and measured for more than a century in various parts\nof the world [38]. They are considered to be highly reliable indications of worldwide warming\ntrends [49]. Mountain glaciers and ice caps are, therefore, key variables to monitor for early\ndetection strategies of global climate-related observations [104].\n\nSince the beginning of the internationally-coordinated collection of information on glacier changes\nwas initiated in 1894 [33], various aspects have evolved in striking ways [104]:\n\n¢ Accelerating glacier shrinkage at the century time scale is now clearly non-cyclic, therefore\nthere is little question that the originally envisaged “variations périodiques des glaciers”\ndoes not apply to ongoing developments [104];\n\ne« As a consequence of the growing influence of human impact on the climate system\n(enhanced greenhouse effect), dramatic scenarios of projected changes including complete\ndeglaciation of entire mountain ranges must be taken into consideration [39]; [84]; [123];\n\ne Such future scenarios may be beyond the range of historical/Holocene variability and most\nlikely introduce dramatic consequences (i.e., extent and rate of glacier melt and\ndisequilibrium of glacier/ climate relationships) [104].\n\ne« The comparison of modern glacier retreat with the Holocene glacier variations provides\nimportant background information for our understanding of natural trends of, and human\nimpacts on, climate change [104].\n\ne« A broad portion of the global community today recognizes glacier changes as a key\nindication of regional and global climate, and environment change [104];",
    "Page_20": "« Observational strategies established by expert groups within international monitoring\nprogrammes build on advances in understanding processes and now include extreme\nperspectives [104];\n\ne These strategies make use of the rapid development of new technologies and relate them to\ntraditional approaches in order to apply integrated, multilevel concepts (in situ\nmeasurements to remote sensing, local-process oriented to regional and global coverage),\nwithin which individual observational\n\n* components (length, area, volume/ mass change) fit together enabling a more holistic view\nof the cryosphere [10].\n\nThe link between historical and past glacier variations and climate can be made through numerical\nmodels. Such models can provide deeper insights concerning past climate and glacier dynamics\n[40][83][67] and several studies have made use of modelling approaches to derive information\nrelated to climate change over different timescales from glacier variations [124][104][62].\n\nAs well as their role as indicators of climate they can represent hazards through a variety of\nmechanisms [118] including advance, retreat and surges, release of ice-dammed lakes, iceberg\ndischarge, and rapid disintegration [91].\n\nThere is thus a need to measure and monitor a range of properties of ice sheets and glaciers,\nincluding the ice volume and extent, distribution of surface features related to the temperature and\nwind regime [14][32], dynamics, and mass balance. As with snow cover, measurement of the\nsurface albedo is also important, since it gives the possibility of modelling the energy balance of a\nglacier. Space-born techniques offer major advantages over in situ measurements in all of these\ncases [91]. Satellite remote sensing has revolutionized ice sheet research [9]. A variety of\ninstruments sensitive to different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum take what the human eye\ndetects as a flat, white desert and provide data sets rich in scientific information [9].\n\nRemote sensing of terrestrial ice masses (glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets) is generally a well-\ndeveloped field. Remotely sensed data are regularly used to compile inventories and surveys of\nglaciers in Europe and the United States. Since 1999, the international GLIMS_ (Global Land Ice\nMeasurements from Space) project has been carrying out routine monitoring of glaciers worldwide,\nusing data from the ASTER and ETM+ sensors [60].\n\nMelting of the ice sheets may severely impact the densely populated coastal regions on Earth [72].\nMelting of the West Antarctic ice sheet alone could raise sea level by approximately 5 m [72]. In\nspite of their importance, the current mass balances (the net gains or losses) of the Antarctic ice\nsheets are not known. Because of difficult logistic problems in Antarctica, field research has\nfocused on only a few major ice streams and outlet glaciers [72]. Yet, to understand the ice sheet\ndynamics fully, we must carefully document all of the coastal changes associated with advance and\nretreat of ice shelves, outlet glaciers, and ice streams [72]. A critical parameter of ice sheets is their\nvelocity field, which, together with ice thickness, allows the determination of discharge rates [72].\nRemote sensing, using moderate- to high- resolution satellite images, permits glacier movement to\nbe measured on sequential images covering the same area; the velocities can be measured quickly\nand relatively inexpensively by tracking crevasses or other patterns that move with the ice [72].\nEspecially important are velocities where the ice crosses the glaciers grounding lines (locations\nalong the coast where the ice is no longer ground supported and begins to float) [72].\n\nRemote sensing has served as an efficient method of gathering data about glaciers since its\nemergence. The recent advent of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning\nSystems (GPS) has created an effective means by which the acquired data are analysed for the\neffective monitoring and mapping of temporal dynamics of glaciers. A large number of researchers\nhave taken advantage of remote sensing, GIS and GPS in their studies of glaciers. These\napplications are comprehensively reviewed in this paper.

As\nwell as its importance in indicating the total amount of ice, surface topography provides important\nclues about the internal structure and can reveal flow features and grounding lines [65]. The\nsensitivity of glaciers to climate, discussed in chapter 1, has meant that a major focus of research\nhas been the assessment of mass balance. Various approaches have been adopted, including direct\nmeasurement, indirect approaches, for example based on estimating the altitude of the equilibrium\nline, and modeling. Modeling based on energy balance calculations requires accurate measurements\nof the surface albedo [112].\n\nVisible-near-infrared (VIR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery both play major roles in\nthe remote sensing of terrestrial ice masses. Other remote sensing techniques are also important in\nstudies of ice sheet and glaciers. Radio echo-sounding and closely related methods such as ground-\npenetrating radar can reveal depth and internal structure, and SAR interferometry reveals surface\ntopography and velocity. Recently, laser profiling has demonstrated the ability to study topography\nin great detail, fine enough to resolve subtle surface features [91].\n\nRemote sensing of terrestrial ice masses (glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets) is generally a well-\ndeveloped field. Remotely sensed data are regularly used to compile inventories and surveys of\nglaciers in Europe and the United States. The highest information density and most complete\nhistorical record for mountain glaciers are in the European mountain ranges, especially the Alps\n[59]. The situation in South America is much less complete [116]. The entire coastal zone of\nAntarctica from the 1970s onward is being mapped ((26]; [117]. Since 1999, the international\nGLIMS-(Global Land Ice Measurements from Space) project has been carrying out routine\nmonitoring of glaciers worldwide, using data from the ASTER and ETM+ sensors [60].\n\n2.2 REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES\n\nIn general terms, remote sensing can be interpreted as the gathering of information about an object\nwithout physical contact. In the more useful but more restricted sense in which the term is normally\nemployed, it refers to airborne or spaceborne observations using electromagnetic radiation. This\nradiation is either naturally occurring, in which case the system is said to employ passive remote\n\n11",
    "Page_24": "sensing, or is generated by the remote sensing instrument itself (active remote sensing) [91].\n\nNaturally occurring radiation includes reflected solar radiation, which is largely confined to the\nvisible and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (wavelengths between roughly 0.35\nand 2.5 ym) and thermally emitted radiation. The range of wavelengths generated by a thermally\nemitting body depends on the temperature. The dominant wavelength is approximately A/T, where\nT is the absolute temperature of the body and A is a constant with a value of about 0.003 Km, so for\na body at a temperature of 273K (0°C) the dominant wavelength is around 11 um. The distribution\nof energy over wavelengths falls very sharply for shorter wavelengths, but at longer wavelengths\nthe decrease is much more gradual. For this reason, thermally emitted radiation can be detected both\nin the thermal infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum (wavelengths typically 8 to 14 um) and\nalso in the microwave region (wavelengths typically lcm to 1m). The wavelength region between\n14 um and Icm is largely blocked by the atmosphere. Figure 2.] summarizes the useful regions of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum for remote sensing and the transparency of the atmosphere [91].\n\nPassive remote sensing systems that detect reflected solar radiation are designed to measure the\nradiance, i.e., the amount of radiation reaching the sensor in a particular waveband. If the amount of\nradiation that is incident on the Earth’s surface is known, the reflectance of the surface can be\ncalculated (this requires that the effects of the atmosphere should be corrected). This can be said to\nbe the primary variable that is measured by such systems [91].\n\nprofilers, while radio-frequency radiation is used by radar altimeters, impulse radar, and similar\nsystems [91]. The second type of active system is, similarly to the passive reflective systems,\nprimarily designed to measure the surface reflectance. However, instead of relying on incident solar\nradiation, the instrument illuminates the Earth’s surface and analyzes the signal returned to it [91].\n\nThis gives the possibility of much greater flexibility in the characteristics of the radiation its\ndirection, wavelength, polarization, and time-structure (for example, it can be pulsed) can all be\ncontrolled [91]. Systems that employ this approach can generally be classed as imaging radars,\nsince they operate in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The primary variable\nmeasured in this case is the backscattering coefficient, a unitless quantity related to the concept of\nreflectance and usually specified in decibels (dB) rather than as a simple ratio or percentage. Its\ndependence on the imaging geometry is often important [91].\n\n: All } |\n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 2. 1: Typical atmospheric transparency and principal regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

    "Page_26": "2.3 ICE SHEET AND GLACIERS\n\nPermanent snow cover eventually forms a glacier, defined as an accumulation of ice and snow that\nmoves under its own weight. A glacier is defined as an accumulation of ice and snow that moves\nunder its own weight [91]. Glaciers occur in a huge range of sizes, with a ratio of approximately 10\nbetween the areas of the largest and the smallest [91]. The smallest glaciers are of the order of 10 ha\n(10° m) in area, while the largest ice masses on Earth are the ice sheets of Antarctica and\nGreenland, representing between them about 99% of the mass and 97%of the area of land ice. Table\n2.1 summarizes the global distribution of land ice [91]. The total of 3.30x10'°m? represents about\n77% of the Earth’s fresh water, the remaining 23% being groundwater (22%) and lakes, rivers,\nsnow, soil moisture, and water vapour (1%) [109]. The total discharge rate from the Earth’s land ice\nhas been estimated as 3 10'? m? per year [64] giving a mean residence time (the time for which a\nmolecule of water remains as part of the glacier) of the order of 10° years [41]. This figure can be\ncontrasted with the residence times of weeks or months for temporary and seasonal snow cover.\n\nThe goal of subsequent analysis of the remotely sensed data is to interpret the value of this\nreflectance and its spatial and temporal variations. In the case of remote sensing systems that detect\nthermal radiation, the sensor again measures the radiance reaching the instrument in a particular\nwaveband. This radiance is normally expressed as a brightness temperature, which is the\ntemperature of a perfect emitter (a so-called black body) that would produce the same amount of\nradiation [91]. The primary variable to be determined is the brightness temperature of the radiation\nleaving the Earth’s surface (again, the effects of the atmosphere must be taken into account to relate\nthe brightness temperature measured at the sensor to the brightness temperature leaving the surface)\n[91]. The brightness temperature is related to the physical temperature of the surface and its\nemissivity, a unitless quantity that defines the ratio of the actual radiance to the radiance that would\nbe emitted by a black body at the same temperature [91]. It follows that the emissivity must\ntherefore take a value between zero and unity, and that it is unity for a black body [91]. Clearly, if\nthe emissivity of a material is known and its brightness temperature can be measured, its actual\nphysical temperature can be calculated. Active remote sensing systems can be divided into two\nmain types. Firstly, there are ranging instruments, whose primary purpose is to measure the distance\nfrom the sensor to the Earth’s surface by measuring the time for short pulses of radiation to travel\ndown to the surface and back again [91]. From this information, the Earth’s surface topography can\nbe investigated. The radiation is visible light or (more usually) near-infrared in the case of laser\n\nAs indicated by Table 2.1, the two ice sheets are enormously thick — on average over |km, and\nreaching a maximum thickness of 4500 m in the case of Antarctica, about 3000min Greenland. In\nfact, the Antarctic ice sheet is really two ice sheets, the East Antarctic and West Antarctic ice sheets,\nseparated by the Transantarctic Mountains. The East Antarctic ice sheet is larger, thicker, and older\nthan the West Antarctic ice sheet; the former is almost entirely above sea level, while the latter is\nalmost entirely below it. Like all glaciers, ice sheets flow in response to gravitational forces. Faster\nmoving regions of ice are called ice streams, essentially rivers of ice flowing across the slower-\nmoving ice sheet. Ice also flows from the ice sheets in the form of outlet glaciers (Figure 2.1).\nWhen these reach the coast the ice continues to flow over the sea, forming an ice shelf that is\nanchored to the coast, as displayed in Figure 2.2, where Reeves and Priestley Glaciers flow together\nand form the Nansen Ice Sheet (the name given by first explorer, although it is really an ice shelf).\nIce shelves are primarily an Antarctic phenomenon. Virtually all of the land area of Antarctica is\ncovered by the ice sheet, while only about 80% of the area of Greenland is ice-covered. About 50%\nof the Antarctic coastline has ice shelves attached to it, the largest being the Ross ice shelf, between\n200 and 1000m thick and roughly the area of France. About 11% of the area and 2.5% of the\nvolume of the Antarctic ice mass is represented by the ice shelves [20]. Ice shelves undergo flexure\nas a result of ocean tides, and the seaward parts are eventually broken off to form tabular icebergs,\nwhich float away and ultimately melt. This process is normally in equilibrium with the addition of\nmass to the ice sheet in the form of precipitation, although there is now considerable evidence that\n\n14",
    "Page_27": "the process is out of equilibrium in a number of cases, with ice shelves undergoing large-scale\ncollapse [91].\n\nSomewhat smaller than the ice sheets are the ice caps (Formally, an ice cap is up to 500,000 km? (5\n10\"! m) in area. Beyond this size it would be classed as an ice sheet), dome-shaped glaciers\ncovering high-latitude islands or highland areas, and typically a few thousand square kilometers in\nextent (Figure 2.3). The major ice caps occur on Iceland, in the Canadian Archipelago, Svalbard,\nand the islands of the Russian Arctic. The remaining classes of glacier are the valley glaciers, which\nform in mountain valleys, and piedmont glaciers which form when the ice from a glacier spreads\nout over flatter ground (Figures 2.4). Glaciers occur on all continents except Australia. The\nprincipal glaciated areas are Alaska, Iceland, Svalbard, Norway, the Russian Arctic islands, the\nAlps, southern Andes, Karakoram, and Himalaya mountains [105]. Of the Earth’s glaciated area,\nexcluding the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, only a few percent occurs in the southern\nhemisphere, predominantly in Chile [95].\n\n2.4 PHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION\n\nRemote sensing, as we have already discussed and in the terms in which we have defined it,\ninvolves making inferences about the nature of the Earth’s surface from the characteristics of the\nelectromagnetic radiation received at the sensor. This process of inference requires that we should\nestablish the relationship between the characteristics of the radiation and the relevant physical\nproperties of the material [91].\n\nA glacier is a large (usually larger than 10 hectares) mass of ice having its origin on land, and\nnormally displaying some movement. It is usually in a state of approximate dynamic equilibrium,\nwith a net input of material in its upper accumulation area and a net loss of material in its lower\nablation area. These two areas are separated by the equilibrium line. Figure 2.5 illustrates\nschematically the relationship between these areas and the flow of ice within the glacier. The input\nto a glacier is in the form of snowfall, and the output is principally in the form of melt-water and, in\nthe case of a glacier whose lower terminus is in water, icebergs that calve off and float away. The\nsnow is transformed to ice through a number of mechanisms [91].\n\nThe surface of a glacier can be divided into a number of zones or facies, an idea developed by\nBenson (1961, [4]) and Muller (1962, [79]). These are illustrated in Figure 2.6, which is adapted\nfrom [88], as is the following description. Uppermost is the dry-snow zone in which no melting\ntakes place. This zone is only found inland in Greenland and over most of the Antarctic ice sheet,\nand on the highest mountain glaciers, where the annual average temperature is lower than some\nthreshold value that was originally proposed as -25°C [4] but is now believed to be around -11°C\n(Peel 1992). Next is the percolation zone, in which some surface melting occurs during the summer.\nThe meltwater percolates downward and refreezes to form inclusions of ice in the form of layers,\nlenses, and pipes. The dry-snow and percolation zones are separated by the dry-snow line. Below\nthe percolation zone, and separated from it by the wet-snow line, is the wet-snow zone in which all\nthe current year’s snowfall melts. Below this, and separated from it by the snow line (sometimes\ncalled the firn line) is the superimposed ice zone. In this zone, surface melting is so extensive that\nthe meltwater refreezes into a continuous mass of ice. The lower boundary of this zone is the\nequilibrium line [91].\n\nNot all of these zones are present in all glaciers. As has already been stated, only the coldest\nglaciers possess dry-snow zones. Temperate glaciers, in which the temperature of all but the upper\nfew meters is at the freezing point, exhibit only wet-snow and ablation zones (the superimposed ice\nzone is generally negligible so the snow line and equilibrium line coincide) [91]. Ice shelves, which\nare parts of glaciers or ice sheets that extend over water, do not have ablation zones but instead lose\nmeltwater, and refreezing of sublimated ice to form depth hoar. The density of the material in a\n\n15",
    "Page_28": "glacier increases with depth [91]. Once the transformation process has begun, the material is\nreferred to as firn rather than as snow, and firn (also called névé) generally has a density greater\nthan 0.55 Mgm”. Firn is porous, since it contains interconnected air channels. However, once the\ndensity increases above about 0.83 Mgm® these channels are closed off, resulting in ice in which\nclosed air bubbles are trapped. Grain sizes in glaciers generally increase with depth, from typically\n0.5 to 1 mm near the surface to a few millimeters at greater depths. The grains in depth hoar can be\nup to 5mm in size[91].\n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE_2. 3: Landsat satellite image mosaic of Devon Island ice cap, Canada.

    "Page_30": "2.5 ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF GLACIERS IN THE\nOPTICAL AND NEAR-INFRARED REGIONS\n\nIn the winter, a glacier surface is usually covered by snow. In the summer, however, other surfaces\ncan be exposed. Figure 2.7 summarizes some experimental data on the spectral reflectance\nproperties of glacier surfaces [91]. The spectra a, c, e, and f, for fresh snow, firn, clean glacier ice,\nand dirty glacier ice, respectively, are adapted from Qunzhu, Meishing, and Xuezhi (1984) [90],\nwhile the spectra b and d, for the accumulation and ablation areas of Forbindels Glacier in\nGreenland, are adapted from Hall et al. (1990) [42]. We note from Figure 2.7 a general tendency for\nthe visible-wavelength reflectance of a glacier surface in summer to increase with altitude, moving\nupwards from the ablation area. This is illustrated in Figure 2.8, which shows the broad-band albedo\nof the glacier Midre Love’ nbreen in Svalbard, measured in situ in summer [91].\n\nAt wavelengths longer than about 600 nm the same general trend is observed, although there is\ngreater observed scatter in the results, presumably as a consequence of the greater sensitivity to\nstructural details such as grain size [120] and the quantity and size of air bubbles in ice [91].\n\n2.6 MASS BALANCE\n\nThe most obvious way of determining the mass balance of a glacier is to make repeated\nmeasurements of its surface topography, using airborne stereo-photography [2] or laser profiling\n[24] for small glaciers. The spatial distribution of the mass balance can be mapped by combining\ntime-difference DEMs with the surface velocity field [46]. For the central regions of Antarctica and\nGreenland radar altimetry or airborne laser profiling can be used, though with difficulty [119][27].\nRepeated airborne laser profiling surveys have shown that the Greenland ice sheet is stable in the\ncenter, though thinning at up to | m/yr toward the coast [65]. This technique has also been used in\nAntarctica, Alaska, and the Swiss Alps [27].\n\nFor glaciers on the peripheries of ice sheets the situation is more difficult [93]. Rignot in 2002 [93]\nadopted the following approach. The output ice flux is estimated from the product of ice shelf\nvelocity (from ERS InSAR) and the cross-sectional area, the thickness being derived from a suitable\nDEM [3] and the assumption that the shelf is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The input ice flux is\ncalculated by integrating the accumulation rate [33][113] over the delineated drainage basin. A\ncorrection is applied for basal melting. This work showed that the position of the grounding line of\n\nseveral major glaciers had previously been substantially misestimated [91]. Most of the glaciers are\nin fact more or less in balance. A similar approach was successfully adopted by Rignot et al. (2000)\n[94] on Greenland. Mass balance can also be estimated indirectly from changes in the distribution\nof the surface zones, e.g., expansion of the ablation area is indicative of negative mass balance. This\ncan be done using VIR imagery [66] or SAR. Mass balance can be inferred indirectly from the\nequilibrium line elevation (ELA), provided that the relationship between the two variables has been\ncalibrated [91].The equilibrium line often coincides more or less with the late summer snow line.\n\nThe European remote sensing satellites ERS-1 and -2 used radar altimetry to measure the altitude of\nice in the Antarctic ice sheets (Figure 3.. The first study is comprised of data from 1992-2002 which\nshows a mass loss and a mass gain which contributed to an overall negative mass balance [125].\nThe ice sheet in West Antarctica (WA) is losing mass (-47 +/- 4Gt per year) and the ice sheet in\nEast Antarctica (EA) shows a small mass gain (+16 +/- 11 Gt per year) for a combined net change\nof —31+/- 12 Gt per year (+0.08 mm at SLE) [125].\n\n18",

Observations of terminus positions and of the gradual deformation of a straight line\nmarked by painted rocks placed on the glacier surface have been replaced by more precise surveying\nmethods [76]. When viewed from space, however, natural surface features supply adequate markers\nwhen their size is small enough to avoid affecting the flow rate. The future certainly portends a\nreversal of roles for field and remote-sensing glaciologists, wherein a few carefully placed field\nmeasurements will be collected to provide control for the dense velocity data fields extracted from\nsatellite imagery [7] or from aerial datasets: as an example, the velocity-field of creeping mountain\npermafrost in Val Muragl, Swiss Alps, with speeds of up to 0.5 m per year, was determined with\nhigh resolution from aerial stereo imagery providing new insights in the spatial coherence of\npermafrost creep [58].\n\nKnowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of flow on fast-flowing Arctic [58] and Antarctic\nglaciers is still limited, but the flow mechanisms are crucial factors in determining mass balance and\nthus in controlling the reaction of these glaciers to climate changes, in particular when these glaciers\nare calving [58]. Therefore ice velocity is a critical parameter control, which, together with ice\nthickness, allows the determination of discharge rates.\n\nThis chapter describes the most utilized approaches to the determination of ice motion by satellite\nand for each technique advantages and disadvantages are specified.\n\nRemotely sensed data approaches can be direct and indirect. Indirectly, motion can be estimated\nfrom a detailed surface topography and assumptions about ice flow. In this chapter only direct\napproaches are shown, that are more used than indirect ones. The most direct approach is through\nthe identification of surface features such as foliation, crevasses and moraines, and tracking their\nmotion in a time-series of images [43]. We examine the principal types of remote sensing systems,\npresenting theoretical outline and giving examples of important real cases.\n\nA not image-based approach is by Global Positioning System (GPS) ground survey [29], that with\nInSAR is the most accurate method, but it presents some severe limitations for the monitoring of\nmountain glaciers, i.e. all glaciers except large ice caps, ice fields, and the Greenland and Antarctic\nice sheets [6] ( see paragraph 3.2.3 ).\n\n21",
    "Page_34": "3.3 REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES\n\nDirect approaches shown in this section based on the identification of surface features on ice. The\nfeatures themselves can be identified manually [74][68][25][31] or by using a cross-correlation\ntechnique [100][101].\n\nMotion ice surface can also be determined using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR),\nboth aerial and terrestrial.\n\n32.1 Visual-based photogrammetric method\n\nInitial use of optical imagery to determine ice motion followed directly from their treatment as the\nmore familiar aerial photography. Images were coregistered using common fixed points, such as\nmountain peaks and rock outcrops, and ice motion was determined by manually picking the position\nof persistent features on the moving ice.\n\nClearly, good image-to-image registration is necessary for this technique. If enough stable ice-free\nfeatures (e.g., nunataks (Figure 3.1) or exposed rock surrounding a glacier) are visible in the images,\nthese can be used as control points. This approach is usually satisfactory for glaciers and the\nperipheries of ice sheets but not for the interiors of ice sheets, where such features are not usually\npresent [91].\n\nExpansion of the regions of interest into the interior of the ice sheet, where sharply defined fixed\npoints were absent, forced the development of new coregistration techniques. In parallel, faster\ncomputers have been employed to tirelessly match thousands of surface features, increasing\ndramatically the rate at which velocity data can be generated [7].\n\nAerial-photogrammetric methods are highly accurate, but the required images are only partially\navailable for remote regions; often they cover only small sections. On the other hand, satellite\nimagery is able to cover large areas, however with a lower resolution [58].\n\n3.2.2 Image Cross-Correlation\n\nCross-correlation techniques based on the pattern of pixel brightness values lie at the heart of each\nadvance. In the algorithm, for each small image chip selected from a reference image, a matching\nchip is searched for in a larger search area within a second image. The reference chip is compared to\na chip of a search area at every center-pixel location in the search area for which the reference chip\nwill fit entirely within the search area. The brightness values, or data numbers (DN), for pixels\nwithin chips are compared on a pixel-by-pixel basis [101]. The similarity of the reference chip and\nthe search area chips is quantified by the expression\n\nDXi - 1, XSu) - Hs)\nCl, 5) ==—_. >\n[ Vy 7\n| (rs) - HI > (5... ~ uy)\n\nLs\n\nwhere: CZs) is the correlation index between the two chips at the search-area chip center-pixel\nlocation L,S; x%,,) is the DN for chip pixel at location 1s; 4, is the average DN for the reference\n\n22",

    "Page_36": "From this correlation map, a variety of correlation statistics are computed to evaluate the match\n(see Paragraph 4.6 and 5.3). Defined by the position of the cross-correlation maximum (peak in\nFigure 3.3), chip displacements can generally be found to a precision of 0.2 pixels, or\napproximately 6 m for Landsat TM image data [101], applying preventively particular image-\nenhancing procedures (Paragraph 5.2.4).\n\nTo maximize the similarity of the surface features in sequential satellite imagery, sun angle and\nazimuth should be nearly the same in both images. This is best accomplished by acquiring scenes\nwith the same scene center location taken at the same time of the year. If there isn’t a digital\nelevation model (DEM) of scene, images can’t be orthorectified. In this case the viewpoints for the\ntwo images should be minimized by acquiring scenes with the same scene-center location.\n\nThe images are preprocessed prior to extracting displacement measurements in order to remove\nnoise (Paragraphs 5.2.1 and 5.2.2), to apply geometric correction (Paragraph 5.2.3) and to enhance\nthe similarity of ice surface features (Paragraph 5.2.4).\n\nPrecision of the derived velocity measurement increases with a greater time interval; however, an\nincreased time interval raises the chance that the surface features have changed in appearance.\nVelocity precision depends on the time separation and is a combination of the systematic error of\nimage-to-image coregistration and chip correlation. Because this measurement is made in the\nground plane of the image, the velocity is strictly the component in this plane. Generally, this\ncomponent is dominant, and only minor differences are expected between velocities measured by\nthis technique and the total speed.\n\nThese methods can succeed only where there are features unique enough to produce correlation\nmaxima. Crevasses and crevasse scars (bridged crevasses) traveling downstream from a source\nregion upstream are the most common source of these features. Fortunately, the most dynamic areas\nof the ice sheets, outlet glacier and ice streams, are well populated with crevasses, and their patterns\nhave proven to be surprisingly unique [7].\n\nIn 1992 a very complete mapping using this technique has been accomplished over ice streams D\nand E in West Antarctica [8]. Even with more rapid and accurate Global Positioning System (GPS)\nsurveying techniques, the production of a similar data set (over 75,000 measurements) would have\nrequired years of field work, thousands of aircraft hours, and great risk to surveyors’ safety\nincrevassed areas. The image-derived velocity field has proven accurate enough to provide an\naccurate determination of surface-horizontal strain rates (velocity gradients) [7].\n\nKaab [58], in 2002, computed horizontal movements from multi-temporal aerial photography and\nAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) orthoimages using a\ndouble cross-correlation technique. The velocity-field of creeping mountain permafrost in Val\nMuragl, Swiss Alps was determined with high resolution from aerial stereo imagery and provided\nnew insights in the spatial coherence of permafrost creep [58]. He estimates the achieved accuracy\nfor horizontal displacements to approximate the size of one image pixel, i.e. 15 m for ASTER and\n0.2 — 0.3 m for the here-used aerial photography.\n\nAlthough automatic feature tracking by using image cross-correlation is primarily applied to VIR\nimagery, it can also be carried out using SAR imagery [22][73][80]. Speckle tracking, in which the\nfeatures are the speckle pattern of the radar image, is also possible [77] [35].\n\n3.2.3. SAR Interferometry\n\nSAR imagery has been used in a cross-correlation manner similar to that described above to\ndetermine ice velocity [34][22][73]. However, interferometric SAR provides a methodology that\ngreatly extends the accuracy and the types of surfaces for which ice velocity data can be obtained\n[7]. The displacement measured by interferometric SAR combines surface topography and ice\n\n24",
    "Page_37": "within the fringe pattern, provide one means to adjust the relative field to an absolute datum, but\nthese are not available in all cases. In the absence of fixed points, measured velocities are necessary\nto control the velocity field. As in the topographic case, phase noise limits the precision and\ncomplicates unwrapping. A typical noise value of 10 at C band (6.3-cm wavelength) corresponds to\na precision of better than 1 mm, which, in the case of a 3-day image separation, corresponds to a\nvelocity accuracy of 0.1 m/yr [7]. The comparatively small incidence angle of SAR (23 is typical)\ncauses vertical motions to be amplified by at least a factor of two relative to horizontal motions [57].\nApparent horizontal motions are further reduced to the component along the line of sight.\n\nThese effects strongly influence the initial appearance of the calculated ice motion fringe pattern.\nCalculation of the desired velocity field requires an assumption of flow direction. Surface-parallel\nflow in the direction of maximum surface slope is generally assumed because the velocity\nperpendicular to the surface is generally less than 1 m/yr [7]. An interferometrically derived DEM\ncan, once again, be employed to define the direction of maximum slope. If a second interferogram\nof an area is available from a different look direction, as is the case when data from ascending and\ndescending orbits are used, the two velocity components can be combined with the assumption of\nsurface-parallel flow to produce the full velocity field [56].\n\nIf the surface topography is known independently, it can be applied to individual interferograms\nextracting independent velocity fields and monitoring for changes in velocity. This concept was\nused to discover a surge of the Ryder glacier in northern Greenland [57]. In this case, sufficient data\nexisted to measure topography and ice motion with one image triplet, and subsequent temporal\nchanges in velocities were measured by repeated use of this topography. Given the all-weather, all-\nseason capability of SAR, this type of monitoring is feasible and holds the promise of revealing\nunsuspected dynamic manifestations of ice sheets. The negative prospect of decorrelation and the\nextraordinary precision of SAR interferometry present new challenges for its practitioners.\n\nRapid metamorphism within the snowpack has hampered interferometric applications in warmer,\nhigher-accumulation glaciated areas. Rapid decorrelation encourages short revisit times. Yet at the\nscale of millimeters, vertical motions become significant, requiring accurate and detailed DEMs,\nwhich can be obtained only with relatively large baselines. Thus there are constraints that define an\noptimal revisit time and baseline length: if either are too long, correlation is lost; yet if either are too\nsmall, either the velocity or topographic signal will be too small. The quantitative optimum depends\non the scale of the topography and the direction of flow relative to the orbit ground track. No single\nset of parameters is ideal for all ice sheet locations.\n\nLike all InSAR measurements, velocity determination depends on phase coherence between the\nimages. If the time interval is long for repeat-pass interferometry, this can be a problem [91]. The\nRadarsat Antarctic Mapping Mission AMM-1 [54] had a repeat period of 24 days, which is very\nlong by InSAR standards. Coherence was generally maintained only for areas with low\naccumulation rates, less than about 15 cm/yr, and in areas not strongly affected by katabatic winds\nor dynamic atmospheric conditions in general [55][121]. For the Radarsat repeat period and imaging\ngeometry, the accuracy in velocity determination is good for low speeds (less than about 100 m/yr),\nbut higher speeds cause difficulty in unwrapping the phase [55] (velocities on an ice shelf can reach\n1000 m/yr or more [122]). Joughin (2002) has developed a technique that combines both InSAR and\nspeckle tracking to cope with higher flow speeds. InSAR has also been used to monitor the flexure\nof ice shelves (of the order of a meter) and demonstrate that it is consistent with physical theory,\nyielding estimates of the position of the grounding line and the elastic modulus of the ice shelf\n[103][36]. Laser ranging will also have the potential to provide such information [87].\n\nUsing RADARSAT SAR imagery obtained during the 2000 Antarctic Mapping Mission, ice\nvelocity vectors were obtained over the Lambert Glacier [128] (Figure 3.4). Only a handful of in\nsitu velocity measurements have been previously reported of this huge glacier system. While the in\nsitu and radar-derived measurements appear to be qualitatively similar, the extent and accuracy of\n\n25",

The areas of no motion (yellow) are either exposed\nland or stationary ice. The smaller confluent glaciers have generally low velocities (green, 100-300 meters per\nyear) which gradually increase as they flow down the rapidly changing continental slope into the upper reaches\nof the faster flowing Lambert Glacier (click on ant-flyover-animation). Most of the Lambert itself has velocities\nbetween 400-800 meters per year, with a slight slowing in the middle section. As the glacier extends across the\nAmery Ice Shelf, velocities increase up to 1000-1200 meters per year as the ice sheet spreads out and thins.\n\n3.3 GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM\n\nThis methodology has been thoroughly investigated over the past years during Italian geodetic\nactivities in Antarctica. A reference GPS stations is located in a stable position (rock outcrops or\nmanmade) while the array of \"rover\" receivers operate over selected areas of the glacier; lastly,\nvertical movements are plotted from the time series of 3D-positions, and local glacier velocities are\ndetermined by comparing initial and final GPS positions within the period [12].\n\nGPS surveys have proven to be very useful for measurement of glacier movement [29].

In static mode, point\npositions are determined by processing entire measurement sessions ranging from a few tens of\nminutes (fast-static mode) to many hours or days, depending on the survey purpose, to produce a\nsingle set of coordinates corresponding to the best estimation of the position for that interval. In\nkinematic mode point positions are determined for each individual observation, e.g. every 1-15\nseconds depending on sampling rate. GPS tecniques, both in static and in kinematic mode, have\nbeen used to monitor David Glacier-Drygalski Ice Tongue and Reeves and Priestley Glaciers. The\nstatic mode guarantees the best possible precision, but monitored points could experience consistent\nhorizontal move (up to 2 m d') and undergo considerable vertical motion on floating parts of the\nglacier, with oscillations related to tidal motion. In order to investigate the effect of the movement,\nkinematic processing was performed on the data of same points as for the static survey [29].\n\nThe recent advent of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has created an effective means by\nwhich all the acquired data can be analyzed for the effective monitoring and mapping of temporal\ndynamics of glaciers [52], and a growing number of researchers can now take advantage of the\nintegration of Remote Sensing, GIS and GPS techniques in their studies on glaciers.\n\n27",

Visual examination of images has represented an important approach in\nthe past and still has a role to play, but quantitative information is now usually extracted by\nprocessing digital images in a computer. Digital image processing and image understanding is a\nhuge field of research in its own right [91].\n\nIn this chapter we briefly describe history and technical specification of remote sensing instruments\nutilized to determinate the ice velocity field in our study area using an image cross-correlation\nmethod.\n\n4.2 PHYSICAL BASIS OF REMOTE SENSING\n\nEnergy is a group of particles traveling through a certain media [140]. Electromagnetic energy is a\ngroup of particles with different frequencies traveling at the same velocity subject to magnetic and\nelectric fields. These particles have a dual-mode nature: they are particles but they travel in a wave\nform. Electromagnetic waves obey the following rule:\n\ny= c\na\nwith\nce: the speed of electromagnetic wave\nA: wavelength\nvi frequency.\n\nThis equation explains that the shorter wavelength has higher spectral frequency. Electromagnetic\nenergy is a mixture of waves with different frequencies (Figure 4./).\n\nWhere the wave represents a group of particles with the same frequency. All together they have\ndifferent frequencies and magnitudes (see Figure 4.1). The Amplitude A reflects the level of the\nelectromagnetic energy. It may also be considered as intensity or spectral irradiance. If we plot A\nagainst the wavelength | we then get an electromagnetic curve, or spectrum (Figure 4.2).\n\nAny matter with a body temperature greater than 0 K emits electromagnetic energy. Therefore, it\nhas a spectrum. The light which our eyes can detect is related to the very small portion of the\noverall electromagnetic spectrum called “visible”. (see Figure 4.3).\n\n29",

Different elements are combined to form compounds, and each compound has a\nunique spectrum due to its unique molecular structure. The atmosphere has different effects on the\nEM transfer at different wavelengths and can have a profound effect on intensity and spectral\ncomposition of the radiation that reaches a remote sensing system. These effects are caused\nprimarily by the atmospheric scattering and absorption [142].\n\nScattering is the redirection of EM energy by the suspended particles in the air. Different particle\nsizes will have different effects on the EM energy propagation. The atmosphere can be divided into\na number of well marked horizontal layers on the basis of temperature. Moreover it is a mixture of\ngases with constant proportions up to 80 km or more from ground. Scattering causes degradation of\nimage quality for earth observation. At higher altitudes, images acquired in shorter wavelengths\n(ultraviolet, blue) contain a large amount of scattered noise which reduces the contrast of an image.\nAtmosphere selectively absorbs energy in different wavelengths with different intensity.

Among various factors that affect the quality and information content of remotely\nsensed data, two concepts are extremely important for remote sensing characterization:\n\n- Resolution: the minimum separating or discriminating power of a measurement. It can be divided\ninto four types: spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal.\n\n- Sampling frequency: determines how frequent are data collected. There are three types of\nsampling important to remote sensing: spectral, spatial and temporal.\n\nCombinations of resolutions and sampling frequencies have made it possible for us to have different\ntypes of remote sensing data.\n\nA description list of resolution types follows:\n\nSpatial Resolution - Spatial resolution refers to the area on the ground that an imaging system,\nsuch as a satellite sensor, can distinguish. Passive sensors have two major spatial characteristics:\n\n- Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV, Figure 4.4): is defined as the angle (radians or\ndegrees) over which the single detector is sensitive to radiation.\n\n- Swath width (refer to Figure 4.4): This is defined as the linear ground distance covered\nin the across-track direction.\n\nSpectral Resolution - The term spectral resolution refers to the width of spectral bands that a\nsatellite imaging system can detect. It is linked with IFOV depending of the wavelength. Multi-\nspectral systems can detect in several discrete bands, it is the width of these bands that spectral\nresolution refers too. The narrower the bands, the greater the spectral resolution.\n\n31",
    "Page_44": "Radiometric Resolution - Radiometric resolution, or radiometric sensitivity, refers to the number\nof digital levels used to express the data collected by the sensor. In general, the greater the\nnumber of levels, the greater the detail of information. The number of levels is normally\nexpressed as the number of binary digits needed to store the value of the maximum level, for\nexample a radiometric resolution of 1 bit would be 2 levels, 2 bit would be 4 levels and 8 bit\nwould be 256 levels.\n\nTemporal Resolution — The temporal resolution refers to amount of time it takes for a\nplatform/sensor to return to a previously recorded location.\n\nSampling determines the various ways we use to record a spectral curve. If data storage is not an\nissue, we may choose to sample the entire spectral curve with many narrow spectral bands.\nSometimes, we choose to make a discrete sampling over a spectral curve. The difference between\nimaging spectrometers and earlier generation sensors is in the difference of the spectral sampling\nfrequency. Sensors of earlier generations use selective spectral sampling. As spatial resolution\nbecomes finer, more details about objects in a scene become available. In general it is true that with\nfiner spatial resolutions objects can be better discriminated with human eyes. With computers,\nhowever, it may be harder to recognize objects imaged with finer spatial resolutions. This is because\nfiner spatial resolutions increase the image size for a computer to handle. More importantly, for\nmany computer analysis algorithms, they cause the effect of \"seeing the tree but not the forest\".\nComputer techniques are far poorer than human brain in generalization from fine details.\n\nTemporal sampling can be regarded similar to spectral sampling. For example, temporal sampling\nmeans how frequently we are imaging an area of interest.\n\nTable 4.1 reports the technical specifications and resolution information for the satellite systems\nused in this study.\n\n4.4 ELECTRO-OPTICAL SYSTEMS IN THE VISIBLE AND NEAR-\nINFRARED REGION\n\nElectro-optical systems operating in the visible and near-infrared (VIR) region possess many\nsimilarities to aerial photography [91]. The spectral range is similar, and the instruments are again\npassive imaging instruments. Indeed, with the rapidly increasing popularity of digital photography,\nthis approach can be thought of as a form of aerial digital photography. The principal difference\nbetween the electro-optical systems and their photographic counterparts is the detection mechanism.\nIn the former case, electromagnetic radiation is detected electronically, instead of photochemically\nas with photography. The electronic detection can take a number of forms, including the use of\nphotomultipliers, vidicons, semiconductor photodiodes, and one- or two-dimensional arrays of\nphotodiodes constituting charge coupled devices (CCDs), now familiar from their role in digital\ncameras and video cameras [91].\n\nElectronic detection offers several advantages over traditional photography. The detectors can be\ncalibrated, so that there is a known quantitative relationship between the recorded signal and the\nintensity of the electromagnetic radiation. The output can be digitized and used to modulate a radio\nsignal so that the data can be transmitted to a remotely located receiver, which is a major advantage\nin the case where the instrument is carried on an unmanned spacecraft. The digital output data can\nconveniently be imported into and processed in a computer.\n\nAlthough VIR imagers are used both from aircraft and from space, the spaceborne applications tend\nto dominate [91].\n\n32",

The forward movement of the satellite or aircraft produces\nsubsequent lines of data (Figure 4.4).\n\n      \n\n \n  \n  \n\n  \n \n\n=\n\n    \n\nFIGURE_4. 3: Sketch of the\nLandsat | satellite FIGURE_4. 4: MSS Scanning system [130]\n\nThe MSS instrument was flown as the secondary and highly experimental instrument. \"But once we\nlooked at the data, the roles switched,\" relates Stan Freden, Landsat 1 Project Scientist.\n\nThe MSS recorded data in four spectral bands: green, red and two infrared bands.\n\nTo help understand the data and to explore the potential applications of this new technology, NASA\noversaw 300 private research investigators. Nearly one third of these were international scientists.\n\nThese researchers came from a wide array of Earth science disciplines. They evaluated the\nusefulness of Landsat data to their respective fields.\n\nIn the foreword of the U.S. Geological Survey's \"ERTS-1 A New Window on Our Planet\"\npublished in 1976, the director of the USGS, Dr. V. E. McKelvey, wrote: \"The ERTS spacecraft\nrepresent the first step in merging space and remote-sensing technologies into a system for\ninventorying and managing the Earth's resources.\"\n\n34",

The quality and impact of the resulting information exceeded all expectations.\n\n4.5.2 Landsat 4 - Thematic Mapper (TM)\n\nLandsat 4 (Figure 4.5)was launched on July 16, 1982. The Landsat 4 spacecraft was significantly\ndifferent in respect to the previous Landsats and Landsat 4 did not carry the RBV instrument.\n\nIn addition to the Multispectral Scanner (MSS) instrument, Landsat 4 (and Landsat 5) carried a\nsensor with improved spectral and spatial resolution, i.e., the new satellites could see a wider (and\nmore scientifically-tailored) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and could see the ground in\ngreater detail. This new instrument was known as the Thematic Mapper (TM) .\n\nThe Landsat 4 TM instrument had seven spectral bands. Data was collected from the blue, green,\nred, near-infrared, mid-infrared (2 bands) and thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic\nspectrum.\n\nWithin a year of launch, Landsat 4 lost the use of two of its solar panels and both of its direct\ndownlink transmitters. So, the downlink of data was not possible until the Tracking and Data Relay\nSatellite System (TDRSS) became operational: Landsat 4 could then transmit data to TDRSS using\nits Ku-band transmitter and TDRSS could then relay that information to its ground stations.\n\nIn 1987, after the Landsat 5 Ku-transmitter failed and Landsat 5 was no longer able to downlink\ninternational data to the U.S. via TDRSS relay, Landsat 4 used its functional Ku-transmitter to\ndownlink acquired international data via the TDRSS. This continued until 1993, when this last\nremaining science data downlink capability failed on Landsat 4.\n\n \n\nA scanline corrector is put in front\nof the focal plane to compensate the\n\n= satellite movement in order to\nobtain continous data coverage\n\n[1 6 detectors\n\nji\n\nFor each mirror sweep, 16 detectors are used to\ncollect the data for B1 - B5 +B?\n4 detectors are used to collect the thermal data.\n\nFIGURE_4. 5: Thematic Mapper acquisition geometry [150]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE_4. 6: Model of Landsat 4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n35",

Landsat 4 operations were contracted out to the Earth Observation Satellite Company\n(EOSAT) corporation in 1984.\n\nBy 1998, the management of the Landsat 4 (and Landsat 5) operations contract was transferred\nfrom NOAA to the USGS; operations were continued by the private sector until mid-2001 when\nSpace Imaging (formerly EOSAT) returned the operations contract to the U.S. Government.\n\nDespite the numerous transfers of satellite operation, the USGS has remained responsible for long-\nterm preservation of Landsat data in its National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive\n(NSLRSDA) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n\nMSS data are collected on only one scanning direction, TM data are collected on both scanning\ndirections (Figure 4.6).\n\n4.5.3.

The Earth observing instrument on Landsat 7, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus\n(ETM+), replicates the capabilities of the highly successful Thematic Mapper instruments on\nLandsats 4 and 5.\n\nThe ETM+ also includes additional features that make it a more versatile and efficient instrument\nfor global change studies, land cover monitoring and assessment, and large area mapping than its\ndesign forebears.\n\nThese features are:\n* apanchromatic band with 15 m spatial resolution\n¢ on-board, full aperture, 5% absolute radiometric calibration\ne athermal IR channel with 60 m spatial resolution\n« an on-board data recorder\n\nConsidered a calibration-triumph, the Landsat 7 mission went\nflawlessly until May 2003 when a hardware component failure\nleft wedge-shaped spaces of missing data on either side of\nLandsat 7’s images.\n\nSix weeks after suffering the loss of its scan line corrector\n(SLC), the ETM+ resumed its global land survey mission\nresulting in only a short suspension of its imagery acquisitions\nfor the U.S. archive. However, the malfunction has impacted\nthe imagery of Landsat 7.\n\nSpecifically, the ETM+ optics contain the Scan Mirror and\nScan Line Corrector assembly among other components\n(Figure 4.8). The Scan Mirror provides the across-track\nmotion for the imaging, while the forward velocity of the\nspacecraft provides the along-track motion. The Scan Line\nCorrector (SLC) assembly is used to remove the \"zigzag\"\nmotion of the imaging field of view produced by the combination of the along- and across-track\n\n   \n\n6\n\nFIGURE 4. 7: Landsat 7 satellite\nin the clean-room prior to launch.\n\n36",

The principal feature was the modification of the HRV, becoming a high-resolution visible\nand infrared (HRVIR) instrument. It has an additional band at mid-infrared wavelengths (1.58-1.75\nmicrometre), intended to provide capabilities for geological reconnaissance, vegetation surveys, and\nsurvey of snow cover, with a resolution of 20 meters. The two HRVIR imaging instruments are\nprogrammable for independent image coverage, increasing the number of imaging opportunities.

INTRODUCTION\n\nA critical parameter for ice sheets is their velocity, which, together with ice thickness, allows the\ndetermination of discharge rates. Remote sensing, using moderate to high-resolution satellite\nimages, permits glacier movement to be measured on sequential images covering the same area; the\nvelocities can be measured quickly and relatively inexpensively by tracking crevasses or other\npatterns that move with ice. Bindschalder and Scambos (1991) have developed and demonstrated a\nmethod of numerical cross-correlation for measuring velocities of crevasses and related features on\nrepeat satellite imagery. The technique has great value in the systematic mapping of the motion of\nglacier, and so, extensive use of it may be expected in the future This thesis expands the discussion\nof this method, applying it to imagery related to Victoria Land, Antarctica.\n\nThe major outlet glaciers of Victoria Land flow into Terra Nova Bay [29](Figure 5.1): Reeves and\nPriestley Glaciers which flow together and form the Nansen Ice Sheet (the name is given by the first\nexplorers, although really it is an ice shelf), and David Glaciers whose seaward extension is the\nDrygalski Ice Tongue [29]. These outlet glaciers drain an area of approximately 250.000 km’,\nwhich includes part of Dome C and Talos Dome [19].\n\nLucchitta and others in 1993 measured the velocity at 73 points of Drygalsky Ice Tongue using\nLandsat MSS (1973) and Landsat TM (1990) images, and found velocity ranging from 171.5 + 1.5\nto 197 + 1.5 cmd” [20]. He also obtained measurements at 137 additional points using Landsat TM\nfrom 1988 and 1990, with results ranging between 37.5 + 8 and 249.8 +8 cm d'. Frezzotti 1993\n[30] calculated the average velocity of Nansen Ice Sheet at 40 points, with values ranging between\n98.5 + 1.5 cmd” and 98.6 + 1.4 cm d™ using Landsat MSS (1972) and Spot XS (1988) with an\naveraging interval of 16 years. The flow rates from GPS measurements are in good agreement with\nthose obtained from analysis of the satellite images [29].\n\nThe methodology for ice velocity calculation based on the correlation of multitemporal satellite\nimages is simple to apply and can yield a large amount of data in a short time.\n\nAlthough automated procedures for selection of reliable data have yielded encouraging results, they\nare still under development. Image coregistration techniques must be improved, while pre-\nprocessing results are satisfactory\n\nThe technique can be used to monitor very wide areas with limited costs, and allows the use of\nmixed data from different sensors.\n\n43",

This multi-\nsensor integration could:\n\n1. improve glaciers monitoring continuity\n2. increase the derived velocity database\n3. allow to evaluate results obtained using data coming from different sensors.\n\nThe premise of our method is that aerially-extensive, subresolution spatial differences in ground\npatterns between images acquired at differing times can be accurately measured to high-precision\nand can be distinguished from systematic image differences, such as those due to sensing-system\nattitude variations [17].\n\nThe chapter explains as the application of particular image processing procedures can improve the\n\nprecision of displacement measurements.

For our purpose I have chosen this sequence: 1) radiometric correction, 2) band\ntransformation, 3) geometric correction and 4) image enhancement. The aim of preprocessing is an\nimprovement of the image data that suppresses unwanted distortions and enhances some image\nfeatures [132] (crevasses or other patterns that move with ice) important for further processing. This\ntask is normally carried out by the agency operating the instrument, which provides the relevant\ncalibration data to the user. The user may need to go further than this and correct these ‘‘at-\nsatellite’? values for the effects of propagation through the atmosphere, in order to determine the\ncorresponding ‘‘at-surface’’ values. All the satellite systems adopted in this application are sun-\nsynchronous and fly across equator at about the same hour (10:00-10:30 A.M., north to south\ndirection, see Chapter 4). Moreover the images are acquired in the same period of year (winter\nseason). In this condition, the atmospheric correction can be evaluate similar in all the images, so\nduring the displacements calculation (differences of coordinates) this error can be considered not\ndeterminant.

It is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the\ndata to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by any projection of the data comes\nto lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on\nthe second coordinate, and so on [129]. PCA is theoretically the optimum transform for a given data\nin least square terms. PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction in a data set by retaining those\ncharacteristics of the data set that contribute most to its variance, by keeping lower-order principal\ncomponents and ignoring higher-order ones. Such low-order components often contain the \"most\nimportant\" aspects of the data. However, depending on the application this may not always be the\ncase. For older multispectral data, such as Landsat TM and MSS, it is useful to produce principal\ncomponent images: the first principal component (PC1) can be used for subsequent cross-\ncorrelations in order to enhance the surface features of glaciers and to ulteriorly reduce image noise\n[100].\n\n5.2.2 Radiometric Correction\n\nAll images (ETM+ images apart) are at basic correction level. The preliminary processes discussed\nin this section are: 1) Calibration, 2) Destripe and 3) Noise Reduction\n\n- Calibration: it is the process of converting the raw digital numbers (DNs) measured by\nsensor into physical quantities (e.g., radiances or brightness temperatures) that they represent.\nIn the case of space-borne imagery this task is normally carried out by the agency operating the\ninstrument, which provides the relevant calibration data to the user. Satellite images to be\ncompared were recorded under different conditions, and pre-processing may be required to\nminimize the dissimilarity of feature shapes due to e.g. different solar illumination, season,\nsensor effects, etc. An user can correct these ‘‘at-satellite’’ values for the effects of propagation\nthrough the atmosphere, in order to determine the corresponding ‘‘at-surface’’ values. For our\npurposes, standard calibration procedures implemented in used software in preprocessing step\nof the adopted software (ERDAS Imagine Pro and ENVI) have to be considered adequate.\n\n- Destripe: striping or banding is systematic noise in an image that results from variation in\nthe response of the individual detectors used for a particular band. This usually happens when a\ndetector goes out of adjustment and produces readings that are consistently much higher or\nlower than the other detectors for the same band. In the case of MSS data, there are 6 detectors\nper band which scan in a side to side motion. If one of the detectors is miscalibrated, then\nhorizontal banding occurs on each 6th line. Similarly, in the case of TM data with 16 detectors\nper band, each 16th line in the image will be affected. The procedure that corrects the values in\nthe bad scan lines is called destriping. It involves the calculation of the mean (or median) and\nstandard deviation for the entire image and then for each detector separately. Landsat TM and\nMSS imagery, that shown clearly many bad lines, are processed using Destripe TM function in\nERDAS Imagine 9.2.\n\nNoise reduction: it’s the process of removing noise from a signal. Noise reduction techniques\nare conceptually very similar regardless of the signal being processed, however a priori\nknowledge of the characteristics of an expected signal can mean the implementations of these\ntechniques vary greatly depending on the type of signal. Landsat ETM+ apart (systematically\ncorrected), all image are processed using this operation in ERDAS Imagine 9.2. This module\nuse an adaptive filter, i.e. a filter that self-adjusts its transfer function according to an\noptimizing algorithm [78].\n\n47",
    "Page_60": "5.2.3 Geometric Correction\n\nRemotely sensed data usually contain both systematic and non systematic geometric errors. In this\nstudy geometric correction is made according to the following steps: a) Ground Control Points\nSelection (georeferencing), b) Orthorectification and c) Resampling.\n\na) Ground Control Points Selection\n\nGeocoding and georeferncing are the process of establishing the relationship between image\ncoordinates (row and column numbers of the pixels) and the corresponding coordinates on the\nEarth’s surface [91].\n\nA common approach to this problem is through the use of ground control points (GCPs),\nwhich are features that are clearly distinguishable in the image and whose ground coordinates\nare also known, for example because they have been surveyed. The pairs of coordinates are\nthen used to determine the parameters of a model relating image to ground coordinates [91].\n\nAnother procedure of GCPs selection consist to register one image to another one previously\ngeoreferenced and orthorectified. In this case, the coordinate system to which the second\nimage is to be referred is that provided by the image coordinates of the first image. I take this\nsecond way, using Automatic Image Registration module of ENVI 4.4., that concur to reach\nthis goal automatically using an area-based image matching that compares the greyscale\nvalues of patches of two or more images and tries to find conjugate image locations based on\nsimilarity in those greyscales value patterns [61]. This kind of algorithm is classified as\nstatistical correlator. Landsat Image Mosaic Antarctica (LIMA) was chosen as reference\nimage. It is the first true-color, high-spatial-resolution image of the seventh continent,\nconstructed from more than 1000 individually selected Landsat-7 ETM+ scenes. Each image\nwas orthorectified and adjusted for geometric, sensor and illumination variations to a\nstandardized surface reflectance product that removed nearly all seams between scenes.\nMosaicing removed nearly all clouds producing a high quality benchmark data set of\nAntarctica in the period 1999-2001 for the International Polar Year. LIMA is viewable and\nindividual scenes or user defined portions of the mosaic are downloadable at\nhttp://lima.usgs.gov. Two scenes that cover the entire study area (E085 and E086) have been\ndownloaded for this application.\n\nThe images are false-color pan-sharpened (band ETM+ 4, 3 and 2). After mosaicing, a PC1\ntransformation of bands was applied to obtain the reference image used for Landsat images\ngeoreferentiation (MSS (PC1), TM (PC1) and ETM+ (PAN)). The layer stack of band 3 (red)\nof LIMA images returns the reference image used for SPOT 4 (Monochromatic) and ASTER\n(band 2) images georeferentiation.\n\nLandsat-7 ETM+ scenes were the preferred source of all LIMA data for three principal\nreasons: the geo-location of the data has been characterized to have a one-sigma accuracy of +\n54 meters [11]; the data were collected during a relatively brief period starting soon after the\nApril 1999 launch of Landsat-7; and the existence of a 15-m panchromatic band provided the\nhighest spatial resolution available with any Landsat sensor.\n\nThe results of area-based matching largely depend upon the quality of the approximate\nrelationship between the base image and the warp image. Statistical correlator maximizes the\nabsolute value of the correlation coefficient and is coarser but more robust than frequential\none (IMCORR, see Paragraph 5.3). Its use is recommended to correlate noisy optical images\nthat provided bad results with the frequential correlator, that is more sensitive to noise, or to\n\n48",

I use a direct orthorectification model (see Appendix 2),\nbased on collinearity equation. This approach contains an important drawback: It projects the\nregular pixel grid from the instrument focal plane to an irregular grid on the round [69]. On a\nlarge scale, irregularities result from the global rotation between the raw and orthorectified\nimages due to the satellite orbit inclination. On a more local scale, irregularities are due to\nchanging in the satellite attitudes and to the topography roughness [69].\n\nThe elevation information is referred to Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project Digital Elevation\nModel version 2 (RAMP DEM v2). The RAMP combines topographic data from a variety of\nsources to provide consistent coverage of all of Antarctica.\n\nThe DEM incorporates topographic data from satellite radar altimetry, airborne radar surveys,\nthe recently updated Antarctic Digital Database (version 2), and large-scale topographic maps\nfrom the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Australian Antarctic Division. Data were\ncollected between the 1940s and present, with most collected during the 1980s and 1990s.\nVersion 2 improves upon the original version by incorporating new topographic data, error\ncorrections, extended coverage, and other modifications [70].\n\nThe 1 km, 400 m, and 200 m DEM data are provided in ARC/INFO and binary grid formats,\nand the 1 km and 400 m DEMs are also available in ASCII format. For our purposes I have\nchosen a 200 m binary grid format.\n\nElevations for points in this data set are measured in meters [m] above the WGS84 ellipsoid,\nthat is based on an approximation of the Earth's shape using only an equatorial radius and a\npolar radius (or a radius and an eccentricity).

    "Page_63": "and Ellipsoid Height (WGS84) measured on GPS vertex TNB1 is 57m, so RAMP DEM was\nlocally corrected summing this value.\n\nThe real horizontal resolution of the DEM varies from place to place according to the density\nand scale of the original source data. The developers of the data set estimate that the\nhorizontal resolution of the DEM is about 200 m in the Transantarctic Mountains and\nAntarctic Peninsula, and about 400 m in the sloped coastal regions. For ice shelves and the\ninland ice sheet covered by satellite radar altimeter data, the horizontal resolution is about 5\nkm, but where the airborne radar sounding data were used, the horizontal resolution is about 1\nkm. For the plateau inside 81.5 degrees south latitude, horizontal resolution is estimated at\nabout 10 km [71]. The accuracy of geolocation (i.e., the accuracy of the position of a given\nfeature on the DEM) is governed by the accuracy of topographic data sources, and is\ngenerally better than the horizontal resolution of the DEM. Vertical accuracy of the RAMP\nAntarctic DEM is + 100 m over rugged mountainous areas, + 15 m for steeply sloped coastal\nregions, + 1 m on the ice shelves, + 7.5 m for the gently sloping interior ice sheet, and + 17.5\nm for the relatively rough and steeply sloped portions of the ice sheet perimeter. For latitudes\nsouth of 81.5 degrees south, within the interior East Antarctic ice sheet and away from the\nmountain ranges, vertical accuracy is estimated to be + 50 m [71]. In our study area ( steeply\nsloped coastal regions) we can assume a + 15 m vertical accuracy.\n\nIn order to coregister correctly RAMP DEM to LIMA a Hillshaded-DEM was computed\nusing Arcview GIS 3.2 (Spatial Analyst). Hillshading provides a rendering of topographic\nsurfaces by assigning brightness to surface elements based on the orientation of these\nelements and a selected direction of illumination [61]. Input parameters (Sun azimuth and\naltitude) can be selected from an image header file of study area.\n\nHillshaded RAMP DEM was coregistered to LIMA (resampled at 200 m) using the\nAutomatic Image Registration module of ENVI 4.4 (Figure 5.5). RAMP DEM was than\nwarped using 6 GCPs in a first order polynomial model, with a RMS of 137 m, an acceptable\nvalue considering the characteristics of DEM.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe GCPs obtained using the methodology explained in the previous paragraph were\nimported into the ortho-model. Another GCP’s selection was applied, minimizing X residuals\n(flow direction, see Assessment Accuracy, Paragraph 5.4.3), spreading the points as much as\npossible in the image, attempting to select them away from the area where ground\ndisplacement is expected. The model needs at least five points to compute the solution (10\ncollinearity equation). Table 5.2 shows the geometric accuracy of the orthoimages used\nduring David Glacier monitoring (Paragraph 5.6).\n\nc) Resampling\n\nAfter establishing the relationship between image coordinates and ground coordinates, it's\nnecessary to reproject the image so that the new image coordinates correspond in a simple\nway to the ground coordinates [91]. In general this is a resampling procedure: in general it\ninvolves interpolation to estimate pixel values for coordinates not represented in the original\nimage. The simplest form of interpolation, which is not really interpolation at all, is called\nnearest neighbour resampling (Figure 5.6).\n\n51",

This method works well with continuous\nsurfaces that are relatively smooth [53]. Cubic convolution assigns the output image pixel a\nweighted average of the input pixels within a rectangular window centred on the output pixel.\nThis has the effect of smoothing the output image and removing unwanted noise [53]. For\nmeasurement of ice displacements at sub-pixel scale, resampling of the images needs\nparticular attention to preserve sub-pixel information from the raw images, so a cubic\nconvolution interpolator was applied to images during reproject operations.\n\nInput images of cross-correlation processing must be at the same spatial resolution.

The test shown in\nFigure 5.7 was performed using PC1 Landsat TM 1992 and SPOT-M 1994 images.

    "Page_67": "5.2.4 Radiometric Enhancement\n\nIn 1992 Scambos et al., in order to enhance small ice surface features in images prior to extracting\ndisplacement measures, suggested the application of high-pass filtering spatial filtering (see\nAppendix 4). This filtering remove brightness variation associated with large-scale topographic\nfeatures, or undulation [101]. Long-wavelength topographic undulation at the ice surface are due to\nresponse of ice flowing over long-wavelength features in the underlying bedrock [174]. Theses\nfeatures remain fixed while the small-scale surface features move with the ice [101]. The scale of\nthe filter should be roughly equal to the thickness of the ice flows over an undulation [175]. For ice-\nstreams flowing in the internal regions of Antarctica, one kilometer (about one ice thickness) has\nproven to be an effective choice for the cut-off wavelength.\n\nIn absence of fixed points and beginning with two images of an area acquired at different times,\ndigital high-pass and low-pass (see Appendix 4) filters are applied to separate each image into its\nshort-scale and long-scale components, respectively [7]. The low-pass images contain surface\ntopographic components created by the underlying basal topography that are assumed fixed in space\n[7]. Thus the images can be coregistered by adjusting their relative positions until the cross\ncorrelation of these images is a maximum. An accuracy of 1-2 pixels is typical [7]. The same\ncoregistration adjustment is then applied to the two high-pass images.\n\nOur aim consisted to avoid the separation of each image into its short-scale and long-scale\ncomponents. We would an unique image that highlights both fine details (moving features) and\nundulations (underlying bedrock),\n\nIn this study, in order to increase the consistency of coregistration, we tried to use both fixed points,\nsuch as mountain peaks and rock outcrops, and underlying basal topography are. This goal was\nreached by a sequential application of low-pass and high-pass filters with boost (see Appendix 4) on\neach image.\n\nPrevious evaluations in the study area (costal region) established a cut-off wavelength of about 500\nm to intercept glacier features [11]. These tests were conducted changing the kernel size of an high-\npass filter applied to a couple of coregistered test images (Landsaat TM 1990-1992) showing a fast\nice-flow on David glacier tongue (Drygalski).\n\nLastly, histogram of the filtered images was than equalized to 8-bit brightness levels (se Appendix\n5). This transformation made it possible to see minor variations within regions that appeared nearly\nuniform in the original image.\n\nIn order to evaluate the results of our procedures, tests was conducted on tsub-images of PC1\nLandsat TM 1992 and of SPOT M. 1994, chosen for the same reason written in the previous\nparagraph.\n\nTable 5.3 shows the statistics of cross-correlation (IMCORR) results using no-enhanced images\n(test 1), high-pass filtered images (test 2, Figure 5.9) and low/high-pass filtered images (test 3,\n\nFigure 5.10).

    "Page_69": "5.3. CROSS-CORRELATION PROCESSING\n\nThe approach is based on matching of reference and search images through correlation analysis of\nsmall sub scenes (chips). As described in Paragraph 4.6, IMCORR algorithm is used both to\naccurately locate tie-point pairs in two images and to find the displacements of moving features,\nprovided that the features show little change in their appearance, and that the motion is strictly\ntranslational [134]. The used input images are subsets that show the ice-flow of interesting.\n\nReference image will have the smaller (‘reference chip') subimages derived from it, at regular grid\nspacing, and these chips will be compared to larger 'search chip' subimages derived from the search\nimage (Figure 3.2). The images must be the same size, and a single (sample, line) coordinate\nsystem will be used for both of them. In the following discussion, it is assumed that the images are\ncoregistered, i.e., that a feature that does not move would be found at the same (sample, line)\ncoordinates in both images [134].\n\nThis IMCORR version takes either 5, 10, or 14 input parameters. The list of input parameters is\nshows in Table 5.4.\n\nThe output file is in ASCII format, and consists of a series of lines with nine entries each. A line is\ngenerated for every grid-point, whether a successful match was found or not, and no matter what the\nquality of the match was [134]. The list of output parameters is shows in Table 5.5. The result flag\nparameter (5) is an integer returned by IMCORR indicating if a good match was found, or if not,\nwhat went wrong. Flag values mean:\n\n1: successfully correlated\n2: failed to correlate; Correlation peak too near edge of search chip\n3: failed to correlate; Subsidiary peak comparable in strength to main peak\n\n4: failed to correlate; Strength of peak below minimum specified by user (we have set minimum to\nzero, so this one will not appear)\n\n5: failed to correlate; Diagonal displacement from nominal location exceeds maximum specified\nby the user\n\nCase 2 is indicated if the match was found within 2 pixels of the limit of where the reference chip\ncan fit within the search chip - such proximity to the edge does not allow for good statistical\ndetermination of whether the match is valid. If case 2, 3, or 4 occurs, zero values are output for peak\nstrength, displacements, and errors [134].\n\nIn order to perform cross-correlation processing, a number of tests were conducted using different\nreference and research chip sizes (the images are the same used in previous paragraph, without\nenhancing).

Residual\nerrors from the co-registration process is to sub-pixel level. Since the front of Drygalski Ice Tongue\nextends some 90 km out to sea from the coast, fixed features are not available as tie-points in this\narea, hence co-registration errors can increase to east along Drygalski Ice Tongue [135]. The\ndisplacement of surface features (crevasses, ice fronts, snow drifts, drift plumes, etc.) in sequential\nimages was determined using a semi-automatic procedure.

Comparison of the results from GPS data and semi-automatic feature tracking in\nareas close to image tie-points (David Glacier) have shown that errors in measured from the feature\ntracking may be as little as +15 m/yr in average velocity and 8-10 degrees in azimuth.

A large number of measures (more than 12.000) were obtained with precisions\nranging from 0.3 to 2.0 em d'(Table 5.8). The average displacement error ranges from 5 to 25 m,\ndecreasing with the augment of image resolutions.\n\nIt must be pointed out that for MSS1973-TM1990 study only 196 matching points were accepted,\ncause of the long time period between image acquisition (about 17 years). In fact, considering an\naverage speed of 150 cm d” a matched point should describe a path of about 9.3 Km; remembering\nthat IMCORR computes only translational displacements, all the results along non rectilinear\ntrajectories were rejected. Another problem for this study is due to high difference in spatial\nresolution of sensors (79 m for Landsat MSS and 28.5 m for Landsat TM). Finally, in order to reach\nsome good results, for displacements computation were used high-pass filtered images (different\nlow-passed images were used for fine coregistration).\n\nThe ice velocity field of principal flow (1) of glacier is mapped In Figure 5.18. This map was\nobtained using two Landsat ETM+ (2001-2002). Ice flow shows two important accelerations, in\ncorrespondence of the caldron on the west side and of the confluence of north-west flow (2) on the\neast side (ice tongue).\n\nThe graph of ice velocity variability along the transversal profile P1 (Figure 5.18) is presented in\nFigure 5.19-a. The peak of velocities is in proximity of central flow axis (c.a. in Figure 5.19-a).\nThe distance of peak with central axe represents probably the different contribute of north-west\nflow (Flow 2 in Figure 5.18): if the peak is on the left of axis it means that during the correspondent\ntime period there was a faster flow coming from this direction.\n\nFigure 5.19-b reveals that the longitudinal ice velocity profile P2 (see Figure 5.18) have an\nascending trade and a near sinusoid shape with variable amplitude and period.

    "Page_84": "Conclusions\n\nThe proposed methodology for ice velocity calculation, based on the cross-correlation of\nmultitemporal satellite images, is simple to apply and yields a large amount of data in a short time.\nThe technique can be used to monitor very wide areas with limited costs, and allows the use of\nmixed data from different sensors.\n\nA first phase in the workflow is image preprocessing. In this first step spectral noises are removed\nand radiometric values are calibrated. The images are geometrically corrected and a subpixel\nprecision is achieved. Free downloadable data has been used as reference (Landsat Image Mosaic of\nAntarctica for planimetric information and Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project DEM vers. 2 for\naltimetry) and can be considered suitable for this purpose.\n\nSequential applications of low-pass filtering, high-pass filtering and histogram equalization enhance\nthe images for cross-correlation processing, both for coregistration and displacement\nmeasurements. The use of boost spatial filters is advised.\n\nImage coregistration techniques have been improved using a fine-coregistration procedure. It’s\nbased on automatic extraction of a large number of tie points using image cross-correlation and on\nminimization of polynomial residuals along ice flow direction.\n\nThe automatic selection of reliable ice velocities was enhanced, using statistical thresholds of\ncontrol parameters and applying a coherence filter appropriately developed, based on statistic\ncomputation of velocity module and azimuth around each measurement.\n\nThe methodology has been applied for the monitoring of David glacier, the most important glacier\nof Scott Coast (Victoria Land, Antarctica) in terms of mass balance. About 12000 measures of\nsuperficial ice velocity were computed for the period January 1973 - February 2006, with an\naverage precision ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 cm d\"'. The results are coherent with those obtained by a\nprevious study for the period 1990-1992 based on the same Landsat TM images, but comparison\nwith GPS data reveals that previously adopted method (semi-automatic features tracking) results\nless accurate than cross-correlation.\n\nThe average ice velocities don’t show relevant changes during monitoring period. The superficial\nvelocities of principal flow present some cyclical irregularities along transversal profiles: the\nglaciological significance of this phenomenon must be investigated.\n\nThe hypothesis of translational movement is very restrictive, limiting the reliability of the results\nonly to the case of ice flowing along a rectilinear segment during time interval between correlated\nimages. In future studies it’s favorable to estimate this approximation error and eventually to correct\nthe results in post-processing by computing the curvilinear abscissa of displacement along ice-flow\ntrajectory. The compute of three-dimensional velocity vectors will be also possible by using DEM\ninformation.\n\nAnother goal to reach in post-processing phase could be the geometric correction of velocity data,\navoiding the computationally heavy geometric correction of images (orthorectification and\nresampling processes).\n\nThe monitoring of large ice flows, looking at the new employment of remote sensing techniques, is\na powerful control instrument of global change. The procedures listen above demonstrate the great\nflexibility of image cross-correlation method in integration of data coming from the new available\nsatellites too.\n\nThe study of the correlations among the most evident global change phenomena (ice sheet melting,\nglacier acceleration, sea level rising, global warming, increasing of natural disasters, etc.) represents\n\n72",

    "Page_100": "Appendix 7: Propagation of Uncertainty\n\n[129] In statistics, propagation of uncertainty (or propagation of error) is the effect of variables’\nuncertainties (or errors) on the uncertainty of a function based on them. When the variables are the\nvalues of experimental measurements they have uncertainties due to measurement limitations (e.g.\ninstrument precision) which propagate to the combination of variables in the function.\n\nThe uncertainty is usually defined by the absolute error. Uncertainties can also be defined by the\nrelative error Ax/x, which is usually written as a percentage.\n\nMost commonly the error on a quantity, Av, is given as the standard deviation, o, . Standard\ndeviation is the positive square root of variance, o°. The value of a quantity and its error are often\nexpressed as . If the statistical probability distribution of the variable is known or can be\nassumed, it is possible to derive confidence limits to describe the region within which the true value\nof the variable may be found. For example, the 68% confidence limits for a variable belonging to a\nnormal distribution are + one standard deviation from the value, that is, there is a 68% probability\nthat the true value lies in the region x + a.\n\n \n\nIf the variables are correlated, then covariance must be taken into account.\nLinear combinations\n\nLet fi(%1,X2,...,Xn) be a set of m functions which are linear combinations of n variables x1,x2,...,.%n\nwith combination coefficients A1;,42,....4ni(k = 1 — m).\n\nfe = >_> Aig; : f = ATX\n\n(A7.1)\n: . . x\nand let the variance-covariance matrix on x be denoted by M .\naf COV», COV;\nMe COVin 03 ~— COVa3\n~ | COViz COVe; 03\n” (A7.2)\nThen, the variance-covariance matrix M! of fis given by\nn n\nMi = S230 AxMj.Ay : Mf = ATM*A\nkool (A7.3)\n\nThis is the most general expression for the propagation of error from one set of variables onto\nanother.
