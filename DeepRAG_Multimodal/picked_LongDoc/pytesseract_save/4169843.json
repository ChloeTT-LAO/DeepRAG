Copies of the NDR application documents can be found at www.resilientshelby.com Also, as described in the NDR Phase 2\napplication, both Memphis and Shelby County are committed to carrying out Fair Housing activities. Shelby County’s Department of Housing,\na partner team member in the NDR application, is the County agency operating HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD)\nentitlement grants and oversees housing programs which directly impact LMI residents which include infrastructure development, housing\nrehabilitation/construction, down payment assistance, lead-based paint hazard reduction, CDBG Disaster Recovery activities, and fair housing\ncounseling. Likewise, the City of Memphis, a partner in the NDR application operates similar activities through its Division of Housing and\nCommunity Development. Both agencies are currently working to promote Fair Housing and Fair Housing Initiatives under their Fair Housing\nAssessments. Additionally, as part of the GREENPRINT, the Memphis Shelby County Office of Sustainability completed a Fair Housing\nEquity Assessment (FHEA) in partnership SCDH, HCD, community and business leaders and other housing partners and addressed fair\nhousing impediments under the Greenprint and recommended various solutions to improve fair housing education and compliance. Under\nthe NDR grant, Shelby County will continue to promote and further Fair Housing utilizing the Shelby County Department of Housing, Memphis\nHCD, and the Greenprint’s FHEA to further assess Fair Housing impediments and incorporate F air Housing initiatives into the NDR Resiliency\nPlan and the NDR projects in North (Big Creek), Central (Wolf River Greenway), and South (Cypress Creek) Shelby County. Currently, efforts\nare underway by Memphis and Shelby County to develop a new AFH Plan under new Fair Housing guidelines by 2018 to more effectively\ncarryout F air Housing initiatives on a joint/countywide basis in order to more efficiently address fair housing issue. The NDR administrative\nstaff will work directly with SCDH, HCD, the Office of Sustainability to insure that Fair Housing is a key component of the NDR Resiliency Plan,\nlong term resiliency efforts, and the long range Greenprint 2040 (which was the base platform for the NDR application in Phase 1 and Phase\n2). The NDR team understands that long term resiliency, social, economic, and environmental issues are a part of any long term Fair Housing\nInitiatives. Through the activities of the NDR grant; and both Memphis and Shelby County's HUD funded grants (CDBG, HOME, Lead Hazard\nControl, etc.) Shelby County will insure that fair housing is a central part of long term resilience efforts resulting from NDR efforts and\n\nprojects. NDR activities will focus on three geographical areas (one in each of the local watersheds) and the development of a Regional\nResilience Plan to create a framework for resilience to provide detailed guidance for future rallow Shelby County to focusncreating a\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\nresilient community both locally and regionally. All four of the NDR funded actions utilize 4 guiding values to guide each activity. Specifically,\nthese values are: (1) People (Health & Well Being) - protect lives, improve quality of life and promote social cohesion, accomplished through\ncreation of wetlands and other flood storage to protect communities and create green assets; (2) Organization (Economy & Society) - reduce\ncommunity burden of vacancy and vulnerable housing by removing resid\n\nMID-URN Areas:\n\nAfter a complete evaluation of Unmet Recovery Needs (URNs) in Phase 1, Shelby County developed a set of four (4) activities designed to\nprotect Shelby County's communities from natural hazards while increasing environmental, economic and social opportunity for all residents of\nthe region, especially vulnerable communities. In Phase 2, the County identified three target areas that were hardest hit by the 2011 disasters:\nalong Big Creek (Northern Shelby County), the Wolf River (Central Shelby County),\n\n2\n\n \n\n“daly Community Development S ystems\ntl: Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)",
    "Page_3": "and South Cypress Creek (Southern Shelby County). Activities within these areas will create additional greenway trails and enhanced\nrecreation areas as well as areas for local food production. A fourth activity will create a Regional Resilience Plan (which includes a hydraulic\nstudy of the of the three main tributaries in the county) over a three-year period to provide a means to tie these and other similar efforts to the\nGREENPRINT, which was developed with the support of a HUD Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant. Each of these activities\nwill lead to replicable interventions that will be transferrable to other areas throughout the region. Furthermore, the goal of each activity was to\nensure that the designs are not only cost effective; but provide the highest resilience value (i.e. social, economic, environmental, etc.) and\nensure that the proposed resilience solutions within the activities are both scalable and replicable throughout the region. Activity 1: Big Creek\nWetland and Recreation Area. Located in North Shelby County within the City of Millington, this area is home to a high percentage of LMI\nhouseholds as well as the Naval Support Activity Mid-S outh, a key military asset and employer for the area. This activity spans an area within\nthe City of Millington running along Big Creek between the Naval Support Activity (NSA) on the East, along Paul Barret Parkway and Big\nCreek, and culminating at Hwy 51 North on the West. The overall service area is composed of the following Census Tracts: 0201.02 Block\nGroup 1 0201.02 Block Group 20202.10 Block Group 1 0202.10 Block Group 2 0202.10 Block Group 30202.10 Block Group 4 0202.21 Block\nGroup 1 0202.21 Block Group 20202.22 Block Group 1 0203.00 Block Group 1 0203.00 Block Group 20203.00 Block Group 3 0204.00 Block\nGroup 1 The 2011 storms caused at least $5 million in damages and displaced community members within the City of Millington. Using a flood\ncontrol practice common to the Corps of Engineers, the primary activity will create a new floodplain by lowering an area along the creek to\nallow flood waters to flow into the floodplain while lowering water surface elevations. Lower water surface elevations will prevent future\nflooding in adjacent communities. If the floodplain had been constructed prior to the 2011 storms, the majority of flooding in the Millington area\nwould not have occurred preventing more than $4.5 million in losses. If this activity had been complete prior to the May 2010 floods, $79\nmillion of property damages would have been prevented. This activity will also create sustainable natural wildlife areas, with native vegetation,\nwetlands, and other natural features. Other amenities will include development of walking trails, small-scale agriculture, ball fields, lakes, and\ncamping areas to provide increased recreational and entrepreneial oportunities. While creating the new floodplain will require the removal of\ntrees to improve water conveyan\n\nMID-URN Areas:\n\nce, a tree canopy plan will be implemented to offset tree removal by four-to-one. Shelby County, the City of Millington, and other jurisdictions\nwill work together to set aside approximately 500 acres for tree mitigation. Some of these areas will be utilized to provide an educational\nexperience for school children from LMI areas. Tree mitigation areas will also provide a cooling effect by expanding the tree canopy to counter\nthe increasing heat-island effect. Construction of this activity will incre\n\nKey Agencies, Partners, Positions, Personnel:\n\nnt within the South Cypress Creek community to create a stronger and healthier neighborhood.\n\n10. A resource to Shelby County since Phase 1, and a partner in the development of Phase 2, the University of Memphis Center for Applied\nEarth Science and Engineering Research (CAESER) will continue its role in assisting Shelby County in it resilience efforts through the\nHydraulic study portion of the Resilience Plan. CAESAR will continue to provide assistance to Shelby County through its applied research,\neducation, and leadership in sustaining community ground water resources, analysis and creation of GIS databases, and tools designed to\nanticipate and provide solutions to reduce the effect of risk when a flooding occurs.\n\n11. Chickasaw Basin Authority (CBA), also a partner in Phase 3, was created as a State of Tennessee Agency as the Regional Development\nAuthority for the Chickasaw Basin in Tennessee. The CBA develops flood control projects in the Loosahatchie and Wolf Rivers and\nNonconnah Creek watersheds. The CBA is authorized by the State of Tennessee by TCA 64-1-201. Its role under Phase 3 will be to assist\nShelby County and other partners in securing support and approval for wetland restoration activities under the Big Creek Wetland and\nRestoration Activity; an area within Shelby County where the CBA has been very active in developing flood control methodology and projects.\n12. The University of Tennessee Agricultural Extension, a partner in Phase 3; provides a gateway to the University of Tennessee as the\noutreach unit of the Institute of Agriculture. UT Extension delivers educational programs and research-based information to citizens throughout\nthe state. Additionally, in cooperation with Tennessee State University, UT Extension works with farmers, families, youth and communities to\nimprove lives by addressing problems and issues at the local, state and national levels. As a partner to Shelby County in implementing the\nNDR award, UT Extension’s role will be to serve as a resource in the development of community programs (especially in Big Creek and South\nCypress Creek) which will educate the community about food and gardening and the creation of community gardens as alternative food\nsources within the community.\n\n13. Memphis Center for Food and Faith (MCFF) and Grow Memphis (which recently merged to become Memphis Tilth) are local nonprofit\norganizations identified in Phase 2 who will work with Shelby County during Phase 3 implementation to engage in urban agriculture and\ncommunity gardening activities designed to bring fresh and healthy food alternatives to citizens residing in the Big Creek and South Cypress\nCreek communities. As partners, they will work to establish community gardens and healthy food options for these areas to enhance greater\naccess to fresh food.\n\n14. The Hyde Family Foundations (a local philanthropy) and the Greater Memphis Chamber gifted $157,000 and $57,000 respectively to\nsupport a coordinator position to transition the GREENPRINT from plan to implementation. Their roles in the NDR through support of this\nposition provide additional support for the Regional Resilience Plan funded under the NDR award.\n\nKey Agencies, Partners, Positions, Personnel:\n\nThe following outlines the partners who will work directly with or provide support to Shelby County in its efforts to carry out NDR projects and\nactivities as well as their roles in the implementation of “Making Room for the River” concepts.\n\n1. Shelby County's role, through the Divisions of Planning and Development and Public Works (and their associated Departments), is as that\nof the lead on the NDR award. Shelby County will actively administer the NDR grant, oversee activity design and development, and implement\nthe 4 activities funded under the NDR award (Big Creek, Wolf River, South Cypress, and the Regional Resilience Plan). The County will work\nclosely with each identified partner to insure that activities move forward, are fiscally feasible, and that NDR funds are properly utilized and\naccounted for throughout the grant award which ends September 2022.\n\nAdditionally, Shelby County in its role as the lead on Phase 1, Phase 2, and subsequently the NDR award implementation lead is responsible\nfor insuring that the following supporting leverage commitments are met:\n\na) Projects integral to the development of the GREENPRINT network involving the development of proposed trail corridors of the\n\n \n\n“i Community Development S ystems\nlil Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)",

City of Memphis, a partner since Phase 1 of the NDRC process, is the largest municipality in Shelby County with a population of nearly\n650,000. Two of the NDR activities (Wolf River and South Cypress Creek) are directly located within the Memphis city limits. Under Phase 3,\nMemphis will play a key role in assisting in the overall design and implementation of the both of these projects. As a partner in the NDR grant,\nMemphis is providing a total of $4,100,000 in direct leverage through its Public Works Division and Division of Housing and Community\nDevelopment (HCD). This leverage can be broken out as follows: $2,500,000 for the Wolf River Wetland and Restoration and $1,600,000 for\nthe South Cypress Creek Activity ($1,500,000 from Public Works and $100,000 from HCD). The City is also a partner in the Shelby County\nResilience Council (SCRC) a multi-disciplinary team appointed by Shelby County Mayor Mark H. Luttrell, J r. to formalize development and\nimplementation of the Greenprint for Resilience P roject. Also, the City of Memphis is filling a developmental role in support of the NDR\napplication and activities by providing $34,423,302 for construction and completion of the Main-to-Main Multimodal Connector Project\nmanaged by the City of Memphis, connecting Memphis to the City of West Memphis, Arkansa, including the Harahan Bridge connection\nacross the Mississippi River; which furthers regional interconnectedness of the Greenprint.\n\n3.

Their role\nwill be to provide direct grants management technical assistance to Shelby County to insure compliance, public access to information, and\neffective administration of resources.\n\n4. Another partner, the Community Development Council of Greater Memphis (CD Council) is a coalition of community and housing\ndevelopment organizations, non-profits, and individuals who support the development and redevelopment of vibrant and economically\nsustainable neighborhoods. Livable Memphis, a program within CD Council, promotes the same priorities with a special focus on growth and\ndevelopment issues - including land use and transportation - and on increasing public participation in planning and development decisions.\nAs a partner under Phase 3, the CD Council (and Livable Memphis) will provide direct community outreach and awareness efforts to assist\nShelby County in its efforts to fully engage the community. Its close ties with CDCs, Neighborhoods, and other non-profits will provide Shelby\nCounty and the other NDR partners with direct links in the community to enhance input into the Resilience Plan as well as the other three NDR\nactivities approved under Phase 3.\n\n5. Pique PR is a full-service PR agency based in Memphis, Tennessee who has been involved with Shelby County’s NDR application from the\nbeginning of Phase 1. Pique will continue its partnership through P hase 3 of the grant and will continue to provide Shelby County with support\nfor public events associated with public outreach, community engagement, and marketing efforts under the NDR award.\n\n6. Kimley-Horn; Barge Waggoner Sumner and Cannon; and Sasaki and Associates are the team of consultants who have been involved in the\nNDR grant since the Phase 1 application and prior to the Phase 3 award. These partners have combined expertise in architecture, urban\ndesign, landscape architecture, civil engineering, environmental reviews, permitting, water resources, and other services to support the\nproposed resilience project. Furthermore, these partners have specialized experience in stormwater modeling, GIS-based applications,\ncreation and permitting of wetlands at both the state and federal levels, and design and implementation of green infrastructure in Memphis and\nShelby County as well as nationwide.\n\na) Kimley-Horn will continue their partnership with Shelby County to carry out environmental reviews and architectural/engineering designs\nassociated with the Wolf River Wetland Restoration and Greenway activity, which includes the components of Kennedy Park, Rodney Baber\nPark, and Orchi Road Improvements. All of these activities comprise the activity along the Wolf River Conservancy’s Wolf River restoration\narea in Central Shelby County and the greenway trail system tying these activities together.\n\nb) Barge Waggoner Sumner and Cannon will continue their partnership role in carrying out environmental reviews and\narchitectural/engineering designs associated with the Big CreeWtnR strtoP oet.

During the quarter three Public Hearings to solicit input from the community were held. These meetings were\nadvertised on the Resilient Shelby website, on the NDR Facebook page at www.facebook.com/ShelbyNDR/, and notices ran in\nthe following local newspapers: The Memphis Flyer (1/11/2018), The Desoto Times (1/11/2018), The Daily News (1/12/2018)\nand in La Prensa Latina (1/14/2018). The meetings were held in three separate locations in the region and were designed to\nset the tone for the overall planning process, create interest in the Resilience Plan, and to solicit input from those in attendance.\nThe meetings were held from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM at the following locations: Memphis Leadership Foundation (1/30/2018),\nBaker Community Center (1/31/2018) and the Southaven Public Library (2/1/2018).

A total of 26 responses were received. A copy of the summary is attached.\n\nAlso, direct planning conversations took place between Office of Resilience (NDR Grant) staff with the following 11\ncities/municipalities to insure input into the Regional Resilience Plan based on their community's disaster recovery and\nresilience activities: Bartlett, TN; Lakeland, TN; Gallaway, TN; Oakland, TN; Germantown, TN; Rossville, TN; Olive Branch,\nMS; Southaven, MS; Horn Lake, MS; Hernando, MS; and Desoto County, MS.\n\nWork also took place on an area study map related to the 2011 flood. The study map is a base map that will ultimately illustrate\nthe 2011 flood extent, and parcel impacts. Once the three projects are complete, there will be additional information added to\nthe map that will illustrate the mitigation effects of the three projects. In addition, the map will be used as a reference for water\nresources and future resilience planning. For example, road closures and flooding hot spots. The map can also potentially be\nused as a working model for the progress that is occurring at all three sites (current draft is attached).\n\nThe status of overall planning activity as of March 31, 2018, is as follows:\n\n1. Phase 1 of the Plan which includes 3 Public Meetings, Data Collection, Plans Review, Historical Research, Threat Definition,\nVulnerability Analysis is 100% complete.\n\n2.
