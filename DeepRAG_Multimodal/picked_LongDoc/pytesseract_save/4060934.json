The Plan\ncontains a vision for the villages along with a set of aims, planning policies and proposals and\ncommunity actions to achieve the vision. The planning policies within the Plan seek to protect the\ncharacter of the villages, with policies guiding new development, notably for housing, business, and\ngreenspace.\n\nFollowing this consultation, the Plan will be amended and then submitted to Leeds City Council, as\nrequired, for a further “Regulation 16” consultation and independent examination. The Plan, if\nsuccessful at examination, will then proceed to a local referendum. If the Plan receives a majority\nvote, the Plan will then be ‘made’ and become part of the statutory development plan — the Local\nPlan - for Leeds. Any planning applications submitted within the boundary will be determined in\naccordance with this plan.\n\nAim of this consultation\n\nThis consultation seeks your views on the content of the proposed Oulton and Woodlesford\nNeighbourhood Development Plan.\n\nAvailability of Documents\n\nThe proposed Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan can be viewed on the\nForum’s website at www.oawnf.org\n\nHard copies of the proposed Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan are also\navailable for inspection at the following locations: our local post offices, the Rothwell One-Stop Centre,\nthe Rothwell Sports Centre, the Oulton with Woodlesford Parish Hall, the Methodist Chapel,\nWoodlesford, Oulton Institute, Leeds Mobile Library, the Temple Lawn Community Centre.\n\nHow to Comment\n\nThe Forum welcomes your comments. Comments should be submitted, preferably using the Survey\nMonkey questionnaire link on our website (www.oawnf.org) or by completing the attached paper\nquestionnaire and leaving at The Oulton Institute, Quarry Hill, Oulton. Written representations may be\ndelivered to the same address or sent by way of the Forum’s website.\n\nThe deadline for comments is April 12\" 2018. The Forum cannot accept any late comments.",
    "Page_32": "Further Information\n\nShould you have any further queries about the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood\nDevelopment Plan please contact us via the Forum’s website or send a letter the Oulton and\nWoodlesford Neighbourhood Forum, Oulton Institute, Quarry Hill, Oulton, Leeds LS26 8SX\n\nThe Forum’s Objectives\n\nThe Forum’s Constitution recognises the objectives of the Neighbourhood Forum as:\n* to agree a long term vision for the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Area.\n* to promote and improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of the Oulton and\n\nWoodlesford Neighbourhood Area.\n\n* to represent the people who live, work or carry out business in the Oulton and Woodlesford\nNeighbourhood Area.\n\n* to produce a Neighbourhood Plan for the Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Area in\nconformity with the local development plan and the national planning policy framework.\n\nThe Plan’s vision for 2033\n\nOur vision is for Oulton and Woodlesford to be a pair of conjoined villages that share a wide range of\nservices and facilities and offer a high quality of life through great educational, recreational and working\nopportunities for all. The villages have a wide range and diversity of high quality housing stock and are\nsurrounded by high quality and accessible countryside and the well maintained and highly prized\nparklands. A significant feature that epitomises our twin urban and rural character is the canal corridor\nwhich now provides a wide range of excellent recreational opportunities.\n\nListed below is a list of the Policies contained in the Plan, - the Plan itself contains the supporting\nevidence for these policies and a number of important appendices which are listed at the end of this\nNewsletter.\n\nHousing.\n\nH1a: Smaller homes\n\nNew housing developments, containing more than 10 units, should contain at least 50% smaller homes\n(i.e. homes having a maximum of two bedrooms).\n\nH1b: Affordable homes\n\nNew housing developments, containing more than 10 units, should:\n\na) Contain at least 20% affordable homes.\n\nb) Ensure that affordable homes are intermingled (“pepper-potted”) with the other homes.\nc) Be delivered either on the development site or elsewhere in the Neighbourhood Area.\n\nH2: Design of new housing developments\n\nNew housing development should have regard to the following:\n\na) Developments should reflect the scale and layout of adjoining neighbourhoods. New developments\nshould have individuality and avoid “Open Plan Anywhere Suburbia” and should include a mix of\nsingle storied housing, terraces, andyards.",
    "Page_33": "b) Developments should provide adequate off-road parking, designed so that vehicles do not dominate\nhouse frontages, either within the curtilage of new homes or through the provision of on street bays\nand other areas dedicated to car parking and that do not serve to clutter the street scene or act as an\nobstruction to the free flow of vehicles and that are located within the development site. Provision\nshould be as follows: 1 or 2 bedroom units — 2 spaces; 3 bedroom units — 3 spaces; 4 bedroom and\nlarger units — 4 spaces.\n\nc) Developments should be designed with the security of residents in mind.\nd) Developments should have high standards of insulation and should conform to the Passive House\n\nStandard of near carbon neutrality.\n\ne) House builders are encouraged to have pre-application consultation and engagement with both local\n\nresidents and with the Forum’s Steering Committee. This should normally lead to a pre-application\ndesign code. If the house builder then wishes to make proposals that are at variance with\nconsultation inputs, an opportunity to discus these with residents should be afforded.\n\nf\n\nNew housing developments should contain no more than 40 units in any phase of development, in\norder not to overwhelm surroundings and to encourage variety in the urban landscape.\n\ng) Each development proposal of 10 or more units should contain at least 20% of either single storied\n\nunits, or two storied units adapted for independentliving.\n\nH3: Design principles for identified site allocations\n\nDevelopment proposals for the following locations should have regard to the following design\nprinciples:\n\na) HG2-176. Windlesford Green Hostel, Holmsley Lane, Woodlesford: There are mature trees on the site\nthat should be protected. Preference for this sites to be developed as flats as this would allow a\nhigher density (possibly upto 40 units). Ground floor flats should be suitable for persons with limited\nmobility.\n\nHG2-177. Alma Villas (site of), Woodlesford LS26 8PW: There are mature trees in the site that should\n\nbe protected. The site slopes and is also an awkward shape. Vehicle access via Alma Street is poor. A\n\nb\n\nsmall part of the site is Green Belt which could be retained as green space. Development of this site\ncould contain a larger number of smaller units than the Leeds Site Allocation Plan proposes.\n\nc\n\nHG2-178. Aberford Road - site of Glenoit and Minerva Mills, Oulton: Small business premises would\nbe viable on this site together with flats. By building flats instead of houses, the capacity of the site\n\n \n\ncould be increased considerably. The canalside location would make it an ideal location for one or\nmore restaurant.\n\nMX2-14. Aberford Road (77/79), Oulton LS26 8HS: The site is classified for mixed development. About\n\nhalf the site currently houses a garage and car showrooms. The southern part of the site is likely to be\n\nd\n\navailable and should be developed to strengthen the Oulton village hub. The site would be ideal for\nextra care housing. It is well situated for this, being near to shops, post office and a café and on a bus\nroute. Such a development will increase the site’s capacity. The frontage on to Midland Street\n(approximately 30m) also has potential for development.\n\nHG2-179. Fleet Lane/Eshald Lane: The draft Site Allocations Plan identifies this site for housing, but\nthe Forum believes this site is ideal for allotments as there are only a few allotments in the Forum’s\narea and a waiting list for these.\n\ne\n\nThe following site is not favoured for development by the Forum but should it proceed then the\nfollowing design principles should apply:",
    "Page_34": "HG2-180. Fleet Lane/Methley Lane: In the event of this development being taken forward, we do not\nwish to see it developed piecemeal, but instead as a number of separate developments, each containing\nno more than forty units. Before planning applications are submitted, the Forum wishes to reach\nagreement with developers for an overall plan for the area including the position of the school and\ntraffic management. Landscaping and greenspaces which accompany any development should be\ncarefully designed in order to mitigate the impact on the Special Landscape Area, the adjacent\nConservation Area and the Green Belt. Serious consideration should also be given to the impact of HS2\nwhich runs adjacent to the site and particularly close in the NE corner and how the impact can be\nmitigated.\n\nThe design of the built environment.\n\nDBE1: Design of the built environment\n\n \n\nThe following principles should apply to all developments:\na) Development proposals should respect local architecture and valued heritage assets.\nb) Development proposals should preserve and enhance the Conservation Areas in line with the Oulton\n\nand Woodlesford Conservation Area Appraisal Management Plans.\n\nc) Loss of garden setting and infill development will be resisted from development particularly in the\nConservation Areas.\nd) Large, mature trees in gardens and on streets provide a soft backdrop for views within and into the\n\nvillage. These should be maintained or, where lost, be replaced on a like for like basis.\n\nFor each individual Character Area, all developments should demonstrate how proposals meet the\nstated “Aspirations for Neighbourhood Plan policies” as identified in Appendix 1.\n\nCharacter Areas are defined as:\n\n¢ Oulton village ¢ The Eastfields\n¢ Woodlesford village ¢ Derwent Avenue and Langdales\n¢ Pottery Lane ¢ The Parkways\n¢ Beechwood and the Northwoods The ¢ Holmsley Grange\nLynwoods ¢ South Oulton\n¢ The Maltings ¢ Oulton Hall and Park and St John the\n¢ All Saints Evangelist Church\n¢ North Oulton ¢ Water Haigh Country Park\n\nDBE2: Develop village centre shopping and leisure environments\n\n \n\nIn order to facilitate the cohesive and sustainable growth of the Neighbourhood Area, development\n\nproposals will be welcomed which support a more integrated, high street style village centre on\n\nAberford Road, Oulton from the Calverley Road/Aberford intersection through to Clown House (former\n\nRitz Cinema). Developments should have regard to:\n\na) Improved safety for pedestrians and vehicle users\n\nb) Enhanced the built environment of the street scene\n\nc) Encourage greening of the street scene\n\nd) Maintain a balance and mix between residential and commercial property\n\ne) Prioritise mixed development on any new development site in this area\n\nf) Promote commercial foot-fall through physical improvements to pedestrian access, street scene and\ncar-parking.\n\ng) Favour new commercial activity in use classes A1-A3.\n\nDevelopment proposals at the commercial centre on Church Street, Woodlesford, should be in line with\n\nexisting use classes in this location and support the ongoing sustainability of this smaller village centre.",

How are\nwe going to set ourselves up to tackle these issues in the near future? What is a pair of conjoined\nvillages? Joined up villages make towns. We either want to maintain a village or become a town to\nattract business opportunities and growth. If people want to live in a village then resist conjoining\nthe neighbourhoods together. insist that new housing estates have their own character and\ncommercial area. The wording of the vision implies that we wish to bury our heads in the sand and\nignore potential issues and keep the village feel. The villages have already been decimated. | grew\nup in villages and this is not a village - it is a commuter belt for one of the largest cities in the UK.\nWhere was this passion when a church steeple was demolished and replaced by 1 large luxury\nhouse? Why is there not more support for small business in terms of rents and rates to support\nmore like the butchers in Woodlesford if a village feel is sought after? A Lidl supermarket is not in\nline with this vision. The villages are just outside the Leeds City bus ticketing area meaning that\nmost households in this area find it cheaper to run a car.

The buses are\nexpensive due to the two companies which serve Leeds. The rail station is busy and trains are\novercrowded. The rail fares are expensive for the experience. A recent success has been the park\nand ride off the East Leeds link to M1. This could be explored further with a intermediate rail\nstation between Woodlesford and Castleford to take some of the strain off the local station. The\nraods are very poor North into Leeds along Pontefract Lane and this is made worse by busy traffic.\nThe plan shows that new housing estates typically are poor for off street parking. These house\nhave driveways. How about discouraging 2 car households by campaigning for better public\ntransport links?\n\nI'd add to this not just being run for and serving the community, but run by the community, taking\nownership of services through cooperatives or social enterprises. Possibly not possible within this\nplan but some of the work done in councils like Preston on promoting cooperative and community\nbusinesses has been very inspiring and boosted their area massively. With the potential HS2\ndisruption to come this could be a way to really promote the area.\n\nThe terms used are very vague, we need traffic lights at the end of Fleet Lane were it joins the\nmain Road has it is hard to turn right with the volume of traffic on the main road, despite two\npedestrian crossings in close proximity.\n\nThe new leisure centre is very welcome but we need youth centres where young people can meet,\ntalk to others and play games. | would also like to see better park facilities in Woodlesford. Better\nplay areas, a tennis court, football posts and less dog mess.\n\nThis depends on what is thought to be needed.\n\nHopefully this will stop teenagers drinking in the local park.\nAs above.\n\nGood facilities yes - what does this mean?\n\nThe local young people need somewhere safe to spend their time, it is unacceptable that older\nchildren ‘hang around’ in the local play area making adults and younger children feel unsafe due to\ntheir behaviour.

Affordable housing should not\nmean small, two bedrooms is small enough even for no child couples, or couples or single parent\nwith one child. The policy makes no sense without further justification\n\nThe houses that are being built should meet the expected demand in the area, not just tick boxes\nof having smaller home for the sake of it.\n\nSome flats for single people are definitely needed\n\nWhy are smaller homes acceptable now? | do not want a smaller home. | want a bigger one.\nThere need to be sustainable homes. Not flats or postage stamp rooms. The British dream is for a\nhome with a garden. Why do people not deserve this now because all the homes which were\npreviously built are now lived in. Yes why not pull up the drawbridge!!!\n\nIn principle yes but is unfair on existing residents to cram extra households in small areas.\n\nPrefer the focus was on the affordable homes.Not sure if this is a policy to move towards some of\nthe suggested flat devlopments further in the document. Even if its a point then 50% seems quite\nhigh. For a family i'd prefer more than 2 bedrooms. Not a very familt friendly policy.\n\nPlease see comments in section 7\nOnly if built on brownfield sites.\nDon't think the ratio should be as high as 50% but otherwise agree\n\n| do in principle but worry about too many single bedroom flats. Could this change the dynamic of\nlocal population?\n\nAll should be 2 story maximum\n\nThere is already a good mix of housing options locally. There should be more emphases on\nmaking homes affordable so families can afford 3 bedrooms and a garden, rather than a 2 bed\nterrace with a yard.\n\nPerhaps bungalows too as they re in short supply.\n\nThere are hardly any bungalows for people to downsize to in the area compared to the rest of the\nhousing stock. Building bungalows would allow people to downsize and stay in the area they like\nand also allow new residents into the area. | also think there should be more sheltered housing for\nthe retired and housing associated housing available to rent. Not everybody can afford to buy a\nhouse or want to.\n\nSee my other points ... why everywhere.

Parking is already a major issue along this\ncanal corridor. A development of restaurant, light industry and flats would be insensitive to the\nborderline countryside nature of this site, Traffic issues already abound in the area of the road\njunctions here, the canal and river bridges and the long sweeping straights that lead up to it.\nSpeeding and blind corners, as well as an increase in traffic here, would be a serious problem and\na danger to both traffic and pedestrians, especially cyclists and walkers/joggers. There are close\ncalls here all the time already.\n\nTrees should be maintained and renewed\nNo Development\n\n| think the strength of objection to HG2-180 is not clear. 'Not favouring’ it but then providing a\nlonger proposal than any other does not really help the cause. Considering HS2 is to cut right\nthrough the heart of the local vista/farmland and be within tens of metres of the Fleet Lane side of\nthis plan, the designation for housing should not be allowed. The recent Applegarth Manor\ndevelopment will be enveloped by the planned HG2-180 site, destroying the current use as\ncommon land for walkers, runners, dog walkers, also removing both light and view for houses\nalong Farrer Lane and Applegarth Manor. the current farmland will also act as buffer for the HS2.\nThe entire NE corner adjacent to the Applegarth Manor development should be removed from the\nproposal in it's entirety.\n\nAlma Villas - The draft development plan makes a recommendation to build more properties than\nhas previously been envisaged/planned. This is despite the traffic problems being noted within the\ndraft development plan. It is considered that, particularly given the access/exit issues which will\naffect all users of Pottery Lane, the proposal to increase the number of units to be developed\nshould be removed when the Development Plan is finalised. Former Glenoit Site - HG2-178 - The\ndraft envisages this site should be developed by building flats. It is agreed that the inclusion of\nsome flats on this site would be a sensible inclusion in a mixed development. However, the\nemphasis on flats does seem to contradict the comments within section 3.3.2 of the draft, where it\nis stated \"the locality is therefore unsuitable for developments displaying uniformity etc\". Similarly,\nany commercial developments within the site need to be sympathetic to the canal-side\nenvironment and adequate parking provision needs to built into any plans.\n\nHG2 176, 177 & 178 are ideally placed for flats or small housing units, not yet more \"executive\nstyle\" homes.\n\nYes they are sensible locations.\n\nHG2 - 177 Woodland and historical sites threatened with being built over. Whos opinion is it that\nsays the site could contain more houses than the 12 mentioned in the plan? The street is narrow,\nover a small bridge and has previously been threatened with 3 story flats, totally out of keeping\nwith the area, street and site.\n\nWoild be good to consider car parking within this if more business deviopment is proposed.\nParticularly through (d)\n\nWe agree with some but do we need so many flats. The allotment (hg2 179) seems fine.\n\n| broadly agree with this policy with the exception of further development on fleet lane/Methley\nlane which should not be allowed to go forward as it is eroding the green space down towards the\ncanal and also will be too close to the hs2 line for the new residents comfort\n\nOnly agree provides that any properties are limited to maximum 2 story height\nDevelopers should be encouraged to provide green space and play facilities for children.\nAbout time something was done re 2-178 .\n\n| don't know enough to comment\n\n32/57\n\n4/11/2018 12:00 PM\n\n4/10/2018 3:22 PM\n4/10/2018 10:06 AM\n4/9/2018 9:56 PM\n\n4/9/2018 1:34 PM\n\n4/6/2018 9:38 AM\n\n4/5/2018 9:53 PM\n4/2/2018 2:36 PM\n\n3/27/2018 9:07 PM\n\n3/26/2018 9:08 PM\n3/22/2018 5:49 PM\n\n3/20/2018 11:50 PM\n3/19/2018 12:59 PM\n3/18/2018 2:32 PM\n\n3/15/2018 12:47 PM",

Take the new\ndevelopment on Fleet Lane (Park Rd) these houses bear little resemblance to Fleet Lane homes\nand pedestrian access to the village (Oulton)is terrible it involves climbing over 2 stiles and a\nmuddy path or a a quarter mile trek down to the junction with Fleet Lane and then doubling back\nup to Aberford Road so most people take their cars\n\nAccess for HS2 development should be from Methley Lane are the south with a temporary road\nfrom Methley Lane to Fleet Lane keeping the majority of construction traffic out of the villages and\naway from the Oulton conservation area. Similarly, access to the north of the tunnel should be\nfrom First Ave again protecting the Woodlesford village centre and schools on Church Street\n\n-building of new homes especially flats would only add to the already congested roads -increased\ntraffic and through traffic =more pollution, danger and noise -the idea of Woodlesford and Oulton is\nthat they are ‘villages’ by building and developing as suggested you would destroy this -FLATS-\nNO, what a stupid idea!!

Obviously a lot of hard\nwork has gone into it. Thank you. Mr P\n\nAs more flood defences are carried out upstream from Woodlesford, i.e. Leeds City Centre,\nFlooding needs to be monitored as more water is pushed downstream. The only outlet is via\nSwillington Bridge. Aberford Road acts like a damn as it is raised above the flood plain. The new\nWoodlesford flood defences have been breached already.\n\n| welcome the improvements suggested. | am angry at the people who sup[port HS2; the billions of\npounds it is due to cost would pay for better hospitals, schools, road repairs, care homes. | know it\nwill create jobs bot so would the improvements on the list. signed W.Hinsliffe (resident for 55\nyears).\n\nLook after our villages and environment please. It's anice place to live, long may it be. Keep\nfighting, well done. Thankyou.\n\nEach new development will put additional pressures on local transport &station parking. A strategy\nfor dealing with these pressures should be formulated alongside development considerations.\n\n| hope right to (light & privacy & green space) is taken into consideration for those living behind\nWindlesford Green when plans are drawn up and not just the rights of the 'big houses’ on\nHolmsley Lane as was the case with the last development put up on the other side.\n\nThe priority must be trying too resolve the traffic congestion in the area. When there is a problem\non the motorways the A642 is an alternative route causing severe problems for local residents!!\nThis is a frequent problem on top of the underlying traffic issue!\n\nThere should be a limit to the supply of ‘flats' - Oulton & Woodlesford are conjoined villages and\nthe risks of over development are that the area then becomes an extension of the South Leeds\nsuburbs. Take care and plan carefully.\n\nParking should already be a major concern in the way it already affects the health and safety of\nthe Woodlesford environment and it is not. It is barely mentioned in this. A serious omission. Why?\nThe wording of this questionnaire is very poor. The fact that submissions close on April 12 should\nbe made clearer and stand higher in the body copy. To lead with the information that consultation\non this plan runs until April 19 infers that this is when comment closes. But this is not the case.\nTherefore the two dates should be stated together and alongside each other so the information is\nclear. For there will be people who want to make comment but will run out of time a week before\nthey think they do. And why is consultation being continued after the closing date for comment?\nThis is not logical nor democratic. Which makes people reluctant to engage another time. Of\ncourse it does.\n\n| think our 'vision' for the future should acknowledge our present problems. We are a parking area\nfor commuters to Leeds due to our rail, bus links No reference is made to reducing traffic levels of\npeople travelling through our area to and from the city centre. We should be encouraging initiatives\nthat improve these issues\n\nNo Comments needed form says it all\n\nAs retired residents we agree totally with the proposed Development Plan in what it seeks to\nachieve and we thank the Neighbourhood Forum for their efforts in seeking to obtain this on behalf\nof the Community.\n\nMy wife and myself fully agree with all the policies. We thank all those who have spent many hours\nworking on the policies. You have all done a great job in keeping Woodlesford & Oulton as a\nwonderful Village suitable for all. Rich and Poor.\n\nThank you for much hard work\n\nA good useful tool and hopefully will be adopted in a purposeful way. | feel it is key those places\nwhich are not on the survey ( Woodlesford School, park and village green and Rothwell Country\nPark) are added or it invalidates a lot of what Woodlesford is about rather than Oulton. As we are\nvery proud of both villages , all their merits need to be included\n\nWe agree with all the Objectives and Policies set out in the plan. We appreciate all the work that\nhas gone into this document! Thank you to all involved.\n\nOulton & Woodlesford should be left as they are. No Development of Housing or Flats should be\nallowed.

The area\nclearly does have it's attractions - as noted in canal-side comments within the plan - and careful\nthought does need to be given about how developments in the area are to be managed. With the\nexceptions of the observations made (above) regarding this, the draft Plan is fully supported\n\nHow can this plan possibly be delivered when there will soon be a high speed train line being built\nright through the middle of Oulton and Woodlesford as well as additional tracks on the outskirts?\n\nSeems a good document, that lots of effort has gone into, so that is appreciated. Hope any of the\ncomments are useful. Most points seem to strike a good balance of protecting the community and\nfamily life so that is good. Seems to be lots of untapped potential in the area. Would like to see\nLeeds look more at cooperative working models and more so within woodlesford and Oulton,\nparticulalrly at a time when families are moving out of the area with the threat of HS2 the area\nneeds more of a sense of community to protect itself.\n\nEXCELLENT PLAN COVERS MOST LOCAL PEOPLE\"S ASPIRATIONS FOR THE AREA. VERY\nCONCERNED THOUGH ABOUT IMPACT OF HS2\n\nGood to see that people are preparing a plan for the villages to improve life. With HS2 Line, HS2\nrail depot, incinerators, extra housing and congested roads, we need some protection and help.\n\nPlease don’t look at my answers and advise that we have agreed with all your questions!! We have\nmarked the ones which we definitely agree with.\n\nAll your plans and policies are good and well thought out. However, my worry is what the reality\nwill be! For example: | saw plans some years ago for the recently built development on Potter\nLane - looked good - so how come there is a 3 storey monstrosity amongst the other well\ndesigned houses!! In addition, a lot of people give time and energy to make the area look good,\nclean and attractive, but no-one has managed to make the owners of the horrible Clown House\nrenovate their frontage or move their bins. It must be the ugliest building in Leeds!\n\nReally worried about HSR1 we don't seem to have a voice that is listened to.\n\n| agree in principle with everything in the plan, but do feel that there is no need to actively\nencourage development. | moved to woodlesford because | liked the village feel and liked being\nsurrounded by countryside. If all of the proposed developments go ahead then woodlesford will\nlose its identity and I'm not sure that is a good thing.\n\nBest of luck !\n\nThe ideas all seem they will help the community grow and prosper but there isn't any information\nhow the proposal intends to tack the problems of traffic congestion. The roads are already\nextremely busy during 'rush hour’, especially, in the morning from 7-9. The queue on the dual\ncarriageway leading to the roundabout to go towards Sturton,M621 and the motorway and then\ngetting onto the M6271 are already bad. | have set off early for work to try to miss some of the\ntraffic.| need a car for my job as | travel to different workplaces, so don't have the option to use\npublic transport. To enable growth you need to have the infrastructure in place, which worries me\nthat this won't be completed properly. When the tunnel for HS2 is being built under Woodlesford\nthey could also think about building something for cars as well.\n\n57/57\n\n4/9/2018 1:34 PM\n\n4/7/2018 7:00 PM\n\n3/27/2018 9:07 PM\n\n3/27/2018 5:06 PM\n\n3/26/2018 10:17 PM\n\n3/26/2018 9:08 PM\n\n3/26/2018 4:16 PM\n\n3/26/2018 2:47 PM\n3/19/2018 12:59 PM\n\n3/18/2018 2:32 PM\n3/16/2018 11:24 PM",

The Plan contains a vision for\n2018 — 2033 along with a set of aims, planning policies and proposals, and community actions to achieve the\nvision. The planning policies within the Plan seek to protect the character of Oulton and Woodlesford, with\npolicies guiding new development, notably for housing, business, greenspace and the environment.\n\nFollowing this consultation, the Plan will be amended and then submitted to Leeds City Council, as required,\nfor a further “Regulation 16” consultation and independent examination. The Plan, if successful at\nexamination, will then proceed to a local referendum. If the Plan receives a majority vote, the Plan will then\nbe ‘made’ and become part of the statutory development plan — the Local Plan - for Leeds. Any planning\napplications submitted within the boundary will be determined in accordance with this Plan.\n\nAim of this consultation\n\nThis consultation seeks your views on the content of the proposed Oulton and Woodlesford\nNeighbourhood Development Plan, together with the supporting Strategic Environmental Assessment\n(SEA) and Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening Report.\n\nAvailability of Documents\n\nThe proposed Oulton and Woodlesford Neighbourhood Development Plan, supporting documents and\nevidence base can be viewed on the website at www.oawnf.org\n\nDeposit Locations\n\nHard copies of the consultation documents are also available for inspection at the following deposit\nlocations:\n\nOulton Post Office, Woodlesford Post Office, the Rothwell One-Stop Centre, the Rothwell Sports Centre,\nthe Oulton with Woodlesford Parish Hall, the Methodist Chapel, Woodlesford, the Oulton Institute,\nLeeds Mobile Library, the Temple Lawn Community Centre.",

We do however consider\nthat reference should be made in the introductory text and / or the\n‘delivering the plan’ text to the emerging Core Strategy Review and how the\nNeighbourhood Plan will be monitored and reviewed in line with the Leeds\nLocal Development Plan, in order to ensure alignment between the\nneighbourhood plan and the Leeds Local Development Plan.\n\nH1a: Smaller Homes\n\nThis policy requires at least 50% of new housing developments above 10\nunits to be one- and two-bedroom homes.\n\nWe object to such a prescriptive policy which is contrary to Core Strategy\nPolicy H4. Core Strategy Policy H4 is worded to offer flexibility, whereas\nPolicy H1a sets an unjustified 10 dwelling threshold and is inflexible and\nshould acknowledge that such a mix may not always be possible. The delivery\nof a mix of houses within a new development scheme is supported however\nthe mix is reflective of need and demand, and is different on a site by site\nbasis, based on the scale and location of the development. Whilst Policy H1a\naligns with Core Strategy Table H4 which provides a ‘target’ of 60% one and\ntwo bed properties, this is not borne out in such a prescriptive manner in\nCore Strategy H4. Further flexibility is required in the wording of Policy H1a\nH1b Affordable Homes\n\nWe recognise that whilst the threshold of 10 units is below that in the Core\nStrategy Policy H5 it aligns with the emerging Policy H5 in the Core Strategy\nReview which has been reduced from 15 dwellings to 10 dwellings (which\naligns with the emerging NPPF).\n\nWe object to the ‘least 20%’ affordable housing requirement in Policy H1b\nwhich goes above and beyond the policy requirement in the Core Strategy\nand emerging Core Strategy Review of 15% minimum target. The justification\nfor this increase “feedback from community members indicates that the\ntarget for the Forum’s area should be 20%” is not robust and appears to be\nbased on consultation responses and a 2015 public survey.

A difference of 5% over and above the\nDistrict requirement could render new development schemes unviable,\nleading to the non-delivery of schemes.\n\nThe policy requirement should be reduced to align with the Core Strategy\nand emerging Core Strategy Review requirement of 15%.\n\nPolicy H2 Design of new housing developments:\n\nWe have no objections to parts a, c, and d of this draft policy; however we\nobject and have concerns with parts b, e, f, and g, which are contrary to\nPolicy P10 of the Core Strategy, and collectively have the danger of rendering\nhousing allocations unviable and undeliverable.\n\nPart b) Car Parking. While we have no objection to the reference to\nproviding adequate off-road parking, we do object to the specific\nrequirement in the policy of the provision of:\n\n2 spaces for 1 or 2 bed dwellings\n\n3 spaces for 3 bed dwellings\n\n4 spaces for 4 bed+ dwellings\n\nThis provision is onerous and unjustified / unsupported by robust evidence.\nThe large number of spaces required is contrary to national government aims\nof reducing car usage, hence why new homes are located in sustainable\nareas, accessible by public transport and close proximity to local facilities.\nThe reference made in the supporting text to this policy on page 24, to the\nLeeds Street Design Guide parking requirements, and how the “observations\nof parking in new developments in the Forum’s area provides evidence that\nthis figure is now outdated...” is not justification to significantly increase the\nrequirements, in particular for 3 and 4+ bed dwellings. The Leeds Street\nDesign Guide provides two methods in relation to calculating the number of\nresidential car parking spaces, both of which have a maximum of 2 spaces\nper dwelling, with less spaces for 1 and 2 bed properties.\n\nThe provision of parking spaces over and above those set out in the Street\nDesign Guide will lead to a requirement for further land to meet the housing\nrequirement, as fewer dwellings will be deliverable on allocated sites due to\nthe curtilage increase to accommodate parking spaces.\n\nThe parking requirement lacks flexibility and makes no reference to visitor\nparking. We suggest this policy is re-worded to align with the Local Plan and\nevidence base in the Street Design Guide.\n\nPart e) Pre-application consultation\n\nApplicants are required to undertake community consultation for proposed\ndevelopment schemes, the detail of which is included in the Council’s\n\n \n\nEvidence — look at any new development and see\ncars already being parked on pavements.\n\nSee comments to Leeds input “The current level of\non-street parking | the Forum’s newest\ndevelopment, Applegarth Manor, Fleet Lane, is\nalready excessive. It is naive to think that this\npolicy will discourage car usage. Commuters using\npublic transport will leave their cars behind. To\nencourage better use of the rail links, better\nparking needs to be provided at Woodlesford\nstation. A car is necessary to make use of Leeds\nPark and Ride facilities.”\n\n \n\nWe have now included\nevidence and the reasoning\nbehind our choices.\n\n \n\n21",
    "Page_124": "Statement of Community Involvement. The scale of community engagement\nis generally proportionate with the scale of the proposed scheme. The first\npart of Part e is acknowledged; however it is unclear what a ‘pre-application\ndesign code’ is and we require further information on this aspect of the\npolicy, which appears to go beyond the policy requirement in the Core\nStrategy and emerging Site Allocations Plan (‘SAP’).\n\nPart f) New housing developments should contain no more than 40 units in\nany phase of development.\n\nWe object to this policy request. There is no explanation or justification for a\n40-unit threshold, nor is there any evidence that a scheme of more than 40\ndwellings will ‘overwhelm surroundings’ or harm variety in the urban\nlandscape. Restricting a development phase to 40 dwellings has the potential\nto hamper the delivery of Site HG2-180 which has a capacity in the emerging\nSAP of 322 dwellings and will not necessarily divide into phases of 40\ndwellings. Such a restriction on delivery into phases of 40 dwellings could\nhave an impact on the delivery of the infrastructure associated with the\nscheme (affordable housing, public open space, education). We therefore\nsuggest that this element of Policy H2 is removed.\n\nPart g) Each development proposal of 10 or more units should contain at\nleast 20% of either single storied units, or two storied units adapted for\nindependent living.\n\nWe object to this policy which lacks justification or evidence to support such\na requirement and is contrary to Core Strategy Policy H8. Core Strategy Policy\nH8 expects developments above 50 dwellings to contribute to supporting\nneeds for Independent Living. There is no percentage requirement for\nspecific house types.\n\nThere is no justification in the supporting text to part g of this policy for a 10-\ndwelling threshold, nor is there any justification for a 20% requirement of\neither single storey or adaptable two storied units. Summary of research at\nparagraph 3.1 informs that “bungalows are around 8% of the area’s housing\nstock, 25% higher than the city average.” Therefore, there are clearly more\nbungalows in the existing housing stock in the neighbourhood area\ncompared with the average in the District. It is suggested that part g is\nrevised to make reference to encouraging developments to support needs\nfor Independent Living in alignment with Core Strategy H8.\n\nPolicy H3 Design principles for identified site allocations:\n\nIt is disappointing that the Plan refers to the Forum not favouring Site HG2-\n180 of which there does not appear to be any reasoning or justification\nprovided. We would welcome the reasoning behind the lack of support.\n\nWe do have some concerns with the wording of the design principles within\nPolicy H3 part f relating to Site HG2-180, which in part stem from\n\n \n\nMore explanation of the justification of this policy\nhas now been included in the Plan\n\nThe arc4 assessment highlights the needs of an\nageing population. The provision of\naccommodation suitable for older residents\nremoves some pressure from providing more\nspecialist accommodation for assisted living.\nEstate agents also highlight the demand for\nbungalows, with quick sales for properties placed\non the market.\n\n \n\nMore explanation now\nincluded.\n\n \n\n22",
    "Page_125": "requirements in Policy H2, as commented on above. We do not agree with\nthe wish that the site should be developed as a number of separate\ndevelopments, each containing no more than forty units. Whilst it is likely\nthat the site will be developed in phases, until further detail on\nmasterplanning is undertaken, the size of the most logical phased delivery of\nthe site is unknown. This policy restricting a single phase to 40 dwellings is\nunworkable and unduly prescriptive.\n\nGiven the scale, site HG2-180 will need to be comprehensively\nmasterplanned, taking into consideration the site requirements as listed in\nthe emerging SAP. Masterplan work will take place in dialogue with the\nCouncil pre and post application submission, and the Neighbourhood Forum\nwill undoubtedly also be invited to comment and contribute to the\nmasterplanning process.

We are among the largest charities in the UK. Our vision\nis that “living waterways transform places and enrich lives”.\n\nThe Trust has a range of charitable objectives, including:\n\nTo hold in trust or own and to operate and manage inland waterways for\npublic benefit, use and enjoyment;\n\nTo protect and conserve objects and buildings of historic interest; and\n\nTo further the conservation, protection and improvement of the natural\nenvironment of inland waterways.\n\nProposed Local Green Space Designations\n\nThe Aire & Calder Navigation, together with Lemonroyd Marina are owned\nby the Trust, and both lie within the Neighbourhood Plan Area. We also\nmanage operations on the Navigation. We note that significant stretches of\nland around the canal and marina are proposed to be designated as Local\nGreen Space (specifically land parcels identified as WH1; CSW; and CSE)\nunder policy GE1: Local Green Spaces.\n\n \n\nWe have communicated with the Trust and believe\nthat the changes we have made relating to this\nLocal Green Space will be satisfactory. We are not\nagainst small scale development near to the canal\nor river if this increases accessibility and\nunderstanding. However, we do not wish a major\ndevelopment on this land at some time in the\nfuture.\n\n \n\n23",
    "Page_126": "The Trust note that the Neighbourhood Plan makes special reference to the\ncanal corridor and makes special reference to the need to maintain the green\ninfrastructure associated with the canal corridor. The Trust are confident that\nthe policies proposed are based on a desire to protect this valued asset and it\nwelcomes this. However, the Trust does have significant concerns that the\ndesignation of land next to the canal as Local Green Space may have\nunintended consequences, which could prevent future proposals to enhance\nthe enjoyment of the canal. This may include the provision of visitor facilities,\nincluding the provision of facilities to enhance the use of the waterway for\nboaters, watersports, and fishing; and changes to the use of moorings to\nallow the mooring of boats that could promote tourism on the waterway.\nThe Trust note that policy BE1 ‘New Business and Employment Development’\nseeks to encourage the development of a local visitor/tourism economy,\nparticularly in canal corridor locations. The Trust has concerns that the\ndesignation of land next to the waterway as Local Green Space could have\nthe unintended consequence of being in conflict with the aims of policy BE1\nand would potentially sterilise the ability for the Trust and the local\ncommunity to promote activity upon the waterway.\n\nSpecifically, as an example, the Trust note that paragraph 3.7.1 (part f)\nmentions aspirations that include the potential provision of a visitor\ninformation centre/café next to Woodlesford Lock. This would be within part\nof the proposed Local Green Space within parcel CSE. A café/visitor\ninformation centre building would impact upon the openness of the site.\nTherefore, the designation of the land as a Local Green Space could prevent\nthe delivery of this facility, as it could be viewed as being contrary to the\npolicy requirements set out in paragraph 76 of the National Planning Policy\nFramework (NPPF) for development on such designated spaces.\n\nParagraph 77 of the NPPF sets out three tests that must be met before land\ncan be designated as local green space. The Trust considers that insufficient\nevidence has been provided to justify the designation of long stretches of\nland adjacent to the canal as Local Green Space. In order to be designated as\nsuch, the area of land must meet all the qualifying criteria set out in\nparagraph 77 which states that the:\n\n“Local Green Space Designation will not be appropriate for most green areas\nor open space. The designation should only be used:\n\nWhere the green space is in reasonably close proximity to the community it\nserves;\n\nWhere the green area is demonstrably special to the local community and\nholds a particular local significance, for example because of its beauty,\nhistoric significance, recreational value (including as a playing field),\n\n \n\n \n\n24",
    "Page_127": "tranquillity or richness of its wildlife; and\n\nWhere the green area concerned is local in character and is not an\nextensive tract of land”.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Trust that the stretches of land within WH1, CSE and\nCSW do not accord with the above tests and consequently should not be\nincluded within proposed local green space designation. Sections of CSE and\nWH1 being considered for the designation are not within close proximity to\nthe villages that the plan relates to. Land to the north of CSE is separated\nfrom the village of Woodlesford by the Aire and Calder Navigation and it is of\nserious concern to the trust that there is no direct safe pedestrian access\nacross the canal. The Forum should note that the locks are unofficial\ncrossings, do not form a safe or convenient route and should under no\ncircumstances be identified as doing so. Additionally, parts of WH1 next to\nLemonroyd Marina are more than 1.2km from the closest village boundary.\nThe Trust has been unable to identify where justification has been provided\nas to why these land parcels (WH1, CSE and CSW) are “demonstrably\nspecial”, or hold particular local significance. No evidence has been provided\nto indicate that there is a discernible difference in appearance, character or\nheritage value of these stretches of land to those adjacent areas not\nconsidered for the Green Space designation, either within or outside of the\nneighbourhood plan area.\n\nThe Trust believe that the size of the proposed land parcels exceed what\ncould properly be defined as ‘local in character’ as required by the paragraph\n77 of the NPPF, and make up extensive tracts of land. Both CSE and WH1\ncomprise of several hectares of land, and all three of the tracts of land next\nto the waterway proposed are over 1km in length.\n\nThe Trust is unclear as to the rationale behind the designation of WH1, CSE\nand CSW as Local Green Space. The Trust is a Statutory Undertaker with\nresponsibility for regulating navigation on the waterway had has a duty to\n‘provide to such an extent as they may feel expedient, services and facilities\non the inland waterways owned or managed by them’ as set out at Section\n10(1) (a) of the Transport Act 1962. The canal forms part of the Trust’s\noperational land, and in accordance with its charitable objectives the Trust\nwill continue to manage the canal as it is presently laid out. Any designation\nof the area as a Local Green Space will potentially restrict future proposals\nthat may be outside of the scope of the Trust’s Permitted Development\nRights as a Statutory Undertaker, but which are nonetheless in accordance\nwith the charitable aims of the Trust.\n\nThe Trust suggest that the proposed Local Green Space allocations alongside\nthe Aire & Calder Navigation are deleted from the plan and instead are\n\n \n\n \n\n25",

The Trust would welcome additional\ntext that advises developers of the need to ensure that their proposed\ndevelopment does not result in damage to off-site footpaths, and the\npossibility that that developers would be required to fund off-site\nimprovements to towpaths.\nThe Trust welcome the general aims of policy BE1 ‘New Business and\nEmployment Development’, notably with regards to the identification of the\npotential role of the canal to promote local visitor and tourism activity in the\narea.\nFor clarity, the Trust recommends that the policy for ‘New Business and\nEmployment Development’ this is given a different policy number to that\nallocated for policy BE1: Design of the Built Environment, referred to on page\n31, to avoid confusion between the two policies.\n\n \n\n \n\n26",
