    "Page_7": "EY\n\n \n\nUndeniably, culture and creativity have\nbeen the cement that binds together\n\nnot only hearts and souls, but entire\nsocieties and nations. In a world\n\nhat faces frequent disruption and\nupheavals - economic, social, political\nand technological - creativity and culture\nave been the common link through\nistory, knitting together our past,\npresent and future.\n\nBut culture and creativity are actually\nmuch more than that. They are catalysts\nor development. They are an economy —\nnearly 30 million people across the world\nmake a living out of them, generating\n‘otal revenues of US$2,250b.\n\nhe momentous impact of the\n\ncultural and creative industries (CCI),\nowever, is only partially understood\nand appreciated. EY’s global map is a\ngroundbreaking initiative to bring to the\nore their economic and social power.\nnitiatives of think tanks, such as the\nForum d’Avignon, bringing together\nartists, industries and policy-makers have\nelped understand the economic weight\nof CCls.\n\n \n\n \n\nBesides the economic weight of culture\nand creativity, our report shows the\n\nunique diversity of these industries.\nAnd some challenges too. Consider, for\ninstance:\n\n» Asia-Pacific is the world’s largest CCI\nmarket, generating a third of total\nrevenues, followed closely by Europe\nand North America. Latin America,\nand Africa and the Middle East rank\nfourth and fifth, respectively - but the\npotential and opportunities in these\ntwo regions is striking.\n\nIn Europe, CCI sectors typically\nemployed more people aged 15-29\nyears than any other sector.\n\n» While some would have feared that\ndigital economy would standardize\nculture and creation, the impact of\ndigital is actually the opposite: the\ndigital economy is accelerating the\ndiversity of culture and creation.\n\n» Although exceptions to the rule\nexist, the crucial role of women in\nCCI's development must be better\nappreciated and rewarded.\n\nOur research also highlights how CCI\nplay a decisive role for the economic\ndevelopment of both mature and\nemerging markets. They are already a\n\nxa\n\nlocomotive of the digital economy. In\n2013, they contributed US$200b to\n\nthe digital economy. The major internet\ngiants of the world have emerged\nthrough and due to creative content,\nobviously. CCI are also a significant driver\nfor urban development: cultural heritage,\nactivities and events are accelerators of\ngrowth and attractiveness. Creators are\nentrepreneurs too: in the US, they are\n3.5 times more likely to be self-employed\nthan US workers overall.\n\nCCI are undoubtedly strong pillars of the\nglobal economy, but fragile if not taken\ncare of. Governments worldwide are\nawakening to the true economic value\n\nof CCI, but challenges to their growth\nabound. CCI need more structuring,\nsupportive policies and robust protection\nof creative content. To boost their\neconomic potential, the balance between\ncreation, access (distribution) and care\nof cultural heritage is a must. We hope\nthis unique report will support a better\nunderstanding of these challenges, and\nhow to address them effectively for the\nlong-term development of creativity and\nculture.\n\nCultural times | The first global map of cultural and creative industries | 7",
    "Page_8": "Cultural and creative industries (CCl) generate US$2,250b of\n\nrevenues and 29.5 million jobs worldwide\n\n \n\nCCI revenues worldwide exceed those of telecom services (US$1,570b globally), and surpass India's\nGDP (US$1,900b). Within the total, the top three earners are television (US$477b), visual arts\n(US$391b), and newspapers and magazines (US$354b). With 29.5 million jobs, CCl employ 1% of\nthe world's active population. The top three employers are visual arts (6.73m), books (3.67m) and\nmusic (3.98m).\n\nThe cultural and creative world is multipolar\n\n \n\nAsia-Pacific accounts for US$743b in revenue (33% of global CCI sales) and 12.7m jobs (43% of CCI jobs\nworldwide). The Asian market is driven by a large population, and the region is home to CCI leaders, such\nas Tencent, CCTV and Yomiuri Shimbun. Europe and North America are the second and third largest CCI\nmarkets. Today Latin America, and Africa including the Middle East rank fourth and fifth, respectively -—\nbut CCI players see great development opportunities in these two regions. Though symbiotic, each world\nregion is developing a momentum of its own.\n\nCultural and creative content drives the digital economy\n\n \n\nCCI are a locomotive of the online economy — contributing US$200b to global digital sales in 2013.\nCultural and creative content also powers sales of digital devices, which totaled US$530b in 2013. Digital\ncultural goods are, by far, the biggest revenue source for the digital economy, generating USS66b of B2C\nsales in 2013 and US$21.7b of advertising revenues for online media and free streaming websites.\n\nCultural production is young, inclusive and entrepreneurial\n\n \n\nCreative activities contribute significantly to youth employment and careers in CCl are relatively open\nto people of all ages and backgrounds. In Europe, CCI sectors typically employed more people aged\n15-29 years than any other sector. Creative industries also tend to favor the participation of women\ncompared with more traditional industries. Statistics compiled by the UK Government showed that\nwomen accounted for more than 50% of people employed in the music industry in 2014 (vs. 47% in\nthe active population overall). Moreover, creation is driven by small businesses or individuals, giving\nrise to agile and innovative employers. More than half (53%) of Canadian gaming developers say they\nare independent operators. In the US, artists are 3.5 times more likely to be self-employed than US\nworkers overall.\n\n8 { Cultural times | The first global map of cultural and creative industries",
    "Page_9": "Culture boosts cities’ attractiveness\n\n \n\nWorld-class cultural infrastructure is a catalyst for urban development: building a museum often offers\nopportunities to engage in large urban development projects and to develop a new “city brand” around\ncultural and creative industries. Such flagship projects boost a city's attractiveness for tourists, talent and\nhighly skilled workers. Bilbao, in Spain's Basque Country, is now an icon of culture-led urban regeneration:\nconstruction of the Guggenheim Museum led to the creation of more than 1,000 full-time jobs, and\ntourist visits have since multiplied eight-fold. Equally important, CCI make cities more livable, providing\nthe hubs and many of the activities around which citizens develop friendships, build a local identity and\nfind fulfillment.\n\nThe informal economy is a vast reservoir of jobs\n\n \n\nInformal CCI sales in emerging countries were estimated to total US$33b in 2013 and to provide\n\n1.2 million jobs. Performing arts are the biggest employers in the informal economy, providing unofficial\nmusic and theater performances (street performances, festivals and concerts that do not pay authors’\nrights, private performances at marriages and funerals, etc.), which are often free for audiences. In\nAfrica, these performances are sometimes funded by individual sponsors.\n\nLeveraging a more creative world\n\n \n\n> Promoting author's rights: If we want authors and creators to continue creating culture and\npromoting cultural diversity, they must be compensated fairly for the use of their works. The current\nfailure to properly reward creators is limiting CCl revenues, and holding back their growth and ability to\ngenerate job creation.\n\n> Looking for growth: As companies chase the scale needed to exploit their best content ideas across\nglobal markets, consolidation is back in vogue. EY's 2015 Media & Entertainment Capital Confidence\nBarometer shows that 50% of CCl companies expect to pursue acquisitions in the next 12 months.\n\n> Pursuing global expansion: Mature markets remain the most attractive for investment by CCl\ncompanies and organizations. Nonetheless, China and India are the emerging markets of choice for\nmany executives, drawn primarily by their strong growth and massive long-term potential.\n\n> Balancing online monetization: CCI players face two difficulties: trying to persuade consumers to\npay for something they may have been accessing for free, and extracting a fair share of the value\ngenerated by cultural content, which has been largely captured by online intermediaries. The problem\nof a value chain distorted in favor of internet intermediaries needs to be addressed by policy makers\nacross borders, so that the internet becomes a fair-trade place for creators and their works.\n\n> Nurturing talent: Talent is the lifeblood of cultural and creative industries. According to urban\neconomist Richard Florida, the “creative class,” including designers, artists and high-skilled intellectual\nworkers, acts as an engine of innovation and urban development, structuring creative hubs and\nnetworks for the economic, social and cultural development of their native cities and regions.\n\nCultural times | The first global map of cultural and creative industries | 9",

More than half (53%)\nof Canadian gaming developers say\nthey are independent operators. In\nthe US, artists are 3.5 times more\nlikely to be self-employed than US\nworkers overall.

In Brazil, CCl workers had\n17% more years of education than the\nnational workforce average in 2010.\n\nToward better access for women\nto cultural employment\n\nWith US$2,250b revenues in 2013\n\nand 29.5m jobs, the creative economy\nappears to be a powerful development\ntool in general. More specifically, it gives\nan idea of the sector's potential to offer\neconomic opportunities to women.\n\nIn many countries, creative industries\ntend to favor the participation of\nwomen compared with more traditional\nindustries. Statistics compiled by the\nUK Government showed that women\naccounted for more than 50% of people\nemployed in the music industry in\n2014 (vs. 47% only in the whole active\npopulation).\n\nHowever, this is not the norm for all\ncreative sectors or job categories within\nthose sectors.

These issues exist within a more\ngeneralized set of difficulties that\ncreators face when attempting to secure\nequitable remuneration for their work:\nrespect for their moral rights, contract\nnegotiation under conditions of extreme\npower asymmetries, securing financial\nbacking for creative projects, and the\ngeneral precariousness of labor contracts\nin many sectors of the CCI. For the\n\nvast majority of women creators, these\ndifficulties are amplified as they intersect\nwith the realities that women face when\nattempting to gain access to economic\nparticipation.\n\nIn many developing countries and\ntransition economies, women creators\nare more likely to be found in crafts\n\nand the visual arts. However, for a large\npercentage of countries — particularly\nthose with weaker intellectual property\nframeworks — this sector is the least\nlikely to have a functioning system of\nregistered copyrights or designs, or\nstrong institutional support.

Cultural goods and services are\nlargely provided though the informal\neconomy, which is estimated to employ\naround 350,000 people and generate\nUSS4.2b revenues in 2013.\n\nThe way people understand culture in\nAfrica and the Middle East reinforces\ninformal distribution channels. The\nnotion of “culture” is often disconnected\nfrom the economic dimension: in\nFrancophone Africa, people are used to\nattending festivals and performances\nand practicing theatre for free. Artists\nrely upon other financial revenues, such\nas sponsorship, to finance their lifestyle.\nThis African attitude to culture fosters\nfree — and illegal — reproduction of\nmusic, video recordings and other art,\nand IP rights are widely ignored.\n\nPoor access to cultural life also fuels the\ninformal cultural economy.

People everywhere listen to\nbroadcasts in local languages. African\ncountries typically have 100-150 radio\nstations, and community radio stations\nare especially common. Small, local and\ndeeply rooted in their communities, they\nhelp strengthen and develop the African\ncultural mosaic.\n\nTelevision also exerts huge influence\n\nin Africa and the Middle East, often\nreaching 90% of its potential audience\nacross Southern Africa. TV is the fastest\ngrowing medium in Africa and the Middle\nEast. This has been made possible at\n\nlast by the extension and reinforcement\nof electricity supplies, and the rollout of\ndigital terrestrial TV in 2015, which has\nopened up the audiovisual landscape.\nPay-TV is gaining ground, especially in\nSouth Africa. The continent's first pay-TV\nmarket is expected to grow by 7.4% a\nyear between 2013 and 2018, reflecting\nhe gradual emergence of an African\nmiddle class.\n\nNewspapers and magazines are published\nwidely in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nhey often serve very local audiences\nwith short print runs, and in West Africa\nat least benefit from state subsidies. But\nhe appetite for information is strong\n\nand reading habits deeply ingrained:\n\non average, each copy is read by\n\n8 to 10 people.\n\nn addition, African countries are\nleapfrogging to mobile-first technology,\noffering many opportunities for CCI in the\nvideo, gaming and music industry.\n\n \n\nCultural times | The first global map of cultural and creative industries | 71",

But it can also\nrequire a great deal of learning, and the\nability to cross-fertilize ideas from the\npast with new techniques, technologies\nand memes.\n\nIn a 2006 paper, The University and\n\nthe Creative Economy, Richard Florida,\nGary Gates, Brian Knudsen and Kevin\nStolarick suggested that universities act\nas engines of innovation, but that their\nrole is really rather wider. They argued\nthat universities often act as creative\nhubs for the economic, social and cultural\ndevelopment of their home cities and\nregions.

Proper protection for\ncreative content is needed everywhere.\nCollective management of rights is a\nsystem that allows creators to devote\ntime to creation, with the guarantee that\neven the most modest use of their work\nwill be tracked and fairly remunerated.\n\nOn top of this general recommendation,\nit is clear that several specific initiatives\nare needed to better protect authors’\nrights. In the music field, the Fair Trade\nMusic initiative is looking at bringing\nmany digital services to the table, to\nidentify and agree “fair trade\" conditions\nfor creators.

Until the early 1970s, HMV\n(now Saregama) had a monopoly over\ndisc manufacturing, hence the practice of\n“bundled rights.”\n\nBack in the early seventies, India’s\nSupreme Court ruled that when authors\nworked for a film, their status was that\nof “hired workers.” The producer was,\ntherefore, the first owner of literary and\nmusical works. In 2012, copyright law in\nIndia took a new turn when both Houses\nof Parliament passed the Amendments\nin a landmark vote of unanimity. It\ncontained three important clauses for\nauthors: authors gained an unwaivable\nright to royalties equivalent to 50% of all\npublishing income; collective licensing of\nliterary and musical works could be done\nonly through a society; and all registered\nsocieties had to re-apply for a license\nwithin a year.\n\nHow has your industry changed over\nthe last few years?\n\nIndia is a unique market, remarkable in\nmany ways.

Like most composers,\nDavid brings the new technology to his\nwork through a digital composing suite\nyet he retains his passion for all things\nclassical, especially the use of orchestral\ninstruments, as well as his beloved\nBoésendorfer grand piano. The digital age\nhas also brought its share of challenges.\nDavid laments the democratization of\nmusic and film and the anonymity given\nto consumers who support piracy sites.\nHe says, like any free market, the less\nexpensive a product becomes (to the\npoint it is free), the more higher skilled\nartisans will gravitate away from that\nmarket and the quality of product will\nrapidly decline.\n\nBecause of the relatively small\npopulation, David believes Australian\ncopyright industries, which generate\nincome of US$4.8b a year, should be a\ncause célébre for the nation’s economic\nhealth.

Smith, 1994).\n\nWe considered only the production and distribution of\ncultural goods and services traded in informal marketplaces\nin developing countries, usually at a lower price, without any\nauthors’ rights collection.\n\n> Only Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America have been\nincluded in our informal economy estimates, as the informal\ncultural marketplaces in Europe and North America are not\nsignificant.\n\n116 { Cultural times | The first global map of cultural and creative industries\n\n \n\nPublic revenues\nBife(=TaXem alos)\n\n> Loss of profit due to piracy, illegal downloading or streaming\nhave been excluded.\n\n» The informal economy has been included in our regional\nsales and employment figures.\n\nInformal sales and employment are estimated through\nillegal cultural goods sales ratios estimated in a sample of\nrepresentative countries (with IFPI, national anti-piracy\ninstitutes and market reports figures), and with data on the\nweight of the informal economy (OECD, ILO).",

As this report aims to highlight the\nimpact of CCI on other branches of the economy, we assessed\nthe revenues generated by cultural content for digital players,\ndefined as companies providing:\n\n» Physical goods sold on the internet (books, music and video)\n\n> Digital cultural content (streaming subscriptions, mobile\ngaming, e-books, etc.)\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nBecause reliable aggregated statistical data was unavailable,\nwe adopted a “bottom-up” approach in this study.

We also conducted 150 interviews\nduring the study to construct our key hypothesis and market\nassumptions.\n\nTotals for jobs and markets have been arrived at after removal\nof double counting:\n\n> For markets, the sum of regional figures exceeded the\nglobal total, as we logically do not consider exports in the\nconsolidated figure.\n\n» The sum of sectorial figures (employment and jobs) also\nexceeds the consolidated figure in each region, as some\nactivities can be counted in two CCl. For instance, live music\nrevenues and employment are counted in both the music and\nperforming arts sectors. To consolidate our regional figure,\nwe deducted every activity that is double counted.\n\nCultural times | The first global map of cultural and creative industries | 117",
