If the operation,\netc., is performed without heeding the advice in the operation\nmanual, there is a risk of personal injury. In addition, the equipment\nperformance may be reduced. Moreover, this alert mark is sometimes\nused with other marks and descriptions indicating other dangers.\n\nWarning\n\nWhen supplying power to this equipment, connect the accessory\n3-pin power cord to a 3-pin grounded power outlet. If a grounded\n3-pin outlet is not available, use a conversion adapter and ground the\ngreen wire, or connect the frame ground on the rear panel of the\nequipment to ground. If power is supplied without grounding the\nequipment, there is a risk of receiving a severe or fatal electric shock.\n\n \n\n \n\nWarning\n\nWARNING A\\\n\nThis equipment can not be repaired by the operator. Do not attempt to\nremove the equipment covers or to disassemble internal\ncomponents. Only qualified service technicians with a knowledge of\nelectrical fire and shock hazards should service this equipment.\nThere are high-voltage parts in this equipment presenting a risk of\nsevere injury or fatal electric shock to untrained personnel. In\naddition, there is a risk of damage to precision components.\n\n \n\n \n\nCaution\n\nLs\n\nElectrostatic Discharge (ESD) can damage the highly sensitive\ncircuits in the instrument. ESD is most likely to occur as test devices\nare being connected to, or disconnected from, the instrument's front\nand rear panel ports and connectors. You can protect the instrument\nand test devices by wearing a static-discharge wristband.\nAlternatively, you can ground yourself to discharge any static charge\nby touching the outer chassis of the grounded instrument before\ntouching the instrument's front and rear panel ports and connectors.\nAvoid touching the test port center conductors unless you are\nproperly grounded and have eliminated the possibility of static\ndischarge.\n\nRepair of damage that is found to be caused by electrostatic\ndischarge is not covered under warranty.\n\n \n\n \n\nWarning\n\n \n\nThis equipment is supplied with a rechargeable battery that could potentially\nleak hazardous compounds into the environment. These hazardous\ncompounds present a risk of injury or loss due to exposure.

Additional instrument functions and descriptions of\noptional measurement capabilities are described in measurement guides. Refer to\n\nAppendix A, “Measurement Guides” for a list of these guides and their Anritsu part numbers.\nMeasurement guides are provided on the Documentation disc that is shipped with the\ninstrument and are also available for download (at no charge) from the Anritsu web site.\nRefer to section “Anritsu Reference Documents” on page 1-7.\n\n1-7 Instrument Description\n\nThe Spectrum Master is a synthesizer-based handheld spectrum analyzer that provides quick\nand accurate measurement results. Measurements can be easily made by using the main\ninstrument functions: frequency, span, amplitude, and bandwidth. Dedicated keys for\ncommon functions and a familiar calculator-type keypad are available for fast data entry.\n\nTime and date stamping of measurement data is automatic. The internal memory provides\nfor the storage and recall of up to 1000 measurement setups and up to 1000 traces using\nMaster Software Tools (MST). External storage can be used for bulk measurement storage.\nThe bright daylight-viewable, high-resolution, color liquid crystal display (LCD) provides\neasy viewing in a variety of lighting conditions. The Spectrum Master is capable of up to\n2.5 hours of continuous operation from a fully charged battery and can be operated from a\n12 VDC source, which also simultaneously charges the battery.\n\nThe Spectrum Master is designed for monitoring, measuring, and analyzing signal\nenvironments. Typical measurements include: in-band interference and transmit spectrum\nanalysis, plus cell site and 802.11a/b/g interference testing. Options are available for RF,\nadvanced demodulation, and over-the-air (OTA) measurement. A full range of marker\ncapabilities (such as peak, center, and delta functions) are provided for faster, more\ncomprehensive analysis of displayed signals. Upper and lower multi-segmented limit lines\nare available to create quick, simple pass/fail measurements. A menu option provides for an\naudible alert when a limit value is exceeded.\n\nIn transmitter analyzer mode, the Spectrum Master displays six markers and the marker\ntable in Code Domain Power and Codogram displays. In Spectrum Analyzer mode, a full\nrange of marker capabilities is provided. Markers are not available in GSM mode.\n\nAnritsu Master Software Tools, a PC-based software program, provides for storing\nmeasurement data. Master Software Tools can also convert the Spectrum Master display into\nseveral graphic formats.\n\n \n\n1-4 PN: 10580-00277 Rev. E Spectrum Master UG",
    "Page_17": "Spectrum Master Specifications\n\nMeasurements may be stored in the internal memory or a USB flash drive. Stored\nmeasurements can be downloaded to a PC by using the included USB and Ethernet cables.\nAfter being stored, the graphic trace can then be displayed, scaled, or enhanced with markers\nand limit lines. Historical graphs can be overlaid with current data by using the PC mouse in\ndrag-and-drop fashion. The underlying data can be extracted and used in spreadsheets or for\nother analytical tasks.\n\n \n\n \n\nNot all USB drives are compatible with the instrument. Many drives come with a\nsecond partition that contains proprietary firmware. This partition must be\n\nNote removed. Only one partition is allowed. Refer to the individual manufacturer for\ninstructions on how to remove it. Some drives can be made to work by reformatting\nthem using the FAT32 format.\n\n \n\n \n\n1-8 Spectrum Master Specifications\n\nRefer to the Technical Data Sheet listed in Section 1-1 for general specifications, detailed\nmeasurement specifications for all available measurement modes, ordering information,\npower sensors, and available accessories. The data sheet is included with the instrument and\nalso available on the Anritsu web site: http://www.anritsu.com.\n\n1-9 Calibration Requirements\n\nThe Spectrum Master loads factory calibration data during start-up, eliminating the need for\ndaily calibration checks. In WCDMA modes, an additional automatic calibration is performed\nas the internal temperature of the Spectrum Master changes (to insure the best possible\nmeasurement results).\n\nAlthough the Spectrum Master does not require daily field calibration, Anritsu Company\nrecommends annual calibration and performance verification by local Anritsu service centers.\n\n1-10 Preventive Maintenance\n\nSpectrum Master preventive maintenance consists of cleaning the unit and inspecting and\ncleaning the RF connectors on the instrument and on all accessories. Clean the\n\nSpectrum Master with a soft, lint-free cloth that is dampened with water or with water anda\nmild cleaning solution.\n\n \n\nCaution _To avoid damage to the display or case, do not use solvents or abrasive cleaners.\n\n \n\nClean the RF connectors and center pins with a cotton swab dampened with denatured\nalcohol. Visually inspect the connectors. The fingers of N(f) connectors and the pins of N(m)\nconnectors should be unbroken and uniform in appearance. If you are unsure whether the\nconnectors are good, then gauge the connectors to confirm that their dimensions are correct.\n\nVisually inspect test port cables. Test port cables should be uniform in appearance, not\nstretched, kinked, dented, or broken.\n\n \n\nSpectrum Master UG PN: 10580-00277 Rev. E 1-5",
    "Page_18": "ESD Cautions\n\n1-11. ESD Cautions\n\nThe MS272xC, like other high performance instruments, is susceptible to ESD (electrostatic\ndischarge) damage. Coaxial cables and antennas often build up a static charge, which may\ndamage the MS272xC input circuitry (if allowed to discharge by connecting directly to the\nMS272xC without previously discharging the static charge). MS272xC operators must be\naware of the potential for ESD damage and take all necessary precautions.\n\nOperators should exercise practices outlined within industry standards such as JEDEC-625\n(EIA-625), MIL-HDBK-263, and MIL-STD-1686, which pertain to ESD and ESDS devices,\nequipment, and practices. Because these apply to the MS272xC, Anritsu Company\nrecommends that any static charges that may be present be dissipated before connecting\ncoaxial cables or antennas to the MS272xC. This may be as simple as temporarily attaching a\nshort or load device to the cable or antenna prior to attaching to the MS272xC. Remember\nthat the operator may also carry a static charge that can cause damage. Following the\npractices outlined in the above standards ensures a safe environment for both personnel and\nequipment.\n\n \n\n1-6 PN: 10580-00277 Rev. E Spectrum Master UG",

Repair or replace damaged connectors immediately. Dirty connectors\ncan limit the accuracy of your measurements. Damaged connectors can damage the\ninstrument. Connection of cables carrying an electrostatic potential, excess power, or excess\nvoltage can damage the connector or the instrument or both. Connection of cables with\ninadequate torque settings can affect measurement accuracy. Over torquing connectors can\ndamage the cable, the connector, the instrument, or all of these items.\n\nConnecting Procedure\n1. Carefully align the connectors.\n\nThe male connector center pin must slip concentrically into the contact fingers of the\nfemale connector.\n\n2. Push connectors straight together. Do not twist or screw them together.\n\n3. To tighten, turn the connector nut, not the connector body. Major damage can occur to\nthe center conductor and to the outer conductor if the connector body is twisted.\n\n4. If you use a torque wrench, then initially tighten by hand so that approximately 1/8 turn\nor 45 degrees of rotation remains for the final tightening with the torque wrench.\n\nRelieve any side pressure on the connection (such as from long or heavy cables) in order\nto assure consistent torque. Use an open-end wrench to keep the connector body from\nturning while tightening with the torque wrench.\n\nDo not over torque the connector.\n\nDisconnecting Procedure\n\n1. If a wrench is needed, then use an open-end wrench to keep the connector body from\nturning while loosening with a second wrench.\n\n2. Complete the disconnection by hand, turning only the connector nut.\n\n3. Pull the connectors straight apart without twisting or bending.\n\n \n\n2-12 PN: 10580-00277 Rev. E Spectrum Master UG",

The intent\nof this chapter is to provide a starting point for making basic measurement setups. This\nchapter describes setup, configure frequency, bandwidth, and amplitude before configuring\nyour measurement setups. After measurements are taken, refer to section “Managing Files”\non page 4-1 for a description of saving, recalling, and deleting measurement files. For more\ndetailed information about specific measurements, refer to the measurement descriptions in\nthe measurement guides for the specific instrument mode and analyzer technology (such as\nSpectrum Analyzer, WiMAX, or 3GPP). Refer to Appendix A, “Measurement Guides”, for a\nlist of these measurement guides and their Anritsu part numbers.\n\nThe Spectrum Analyzer Measurement Guide includes sections that describe resolution\nbandwidth, video bandwidth, sweep, and attenuator functions. For example, in the\nSpectrum Master, Resolution Bandwidth is determined by the intermediate frequency (IF)\nfilter bandwidth. The spectrum analyzer traces the shape of the IF filter as it tunes past a\nsignal. If more than one IF filter is used in a spectrum analyzer, then the narrowest one\ndominates and is considered the resolution bandwidth.

    "Page_103": "DHCP\n\nC-3 DHCP\n\nDHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol that allows a server to\ndynamically assign IP addresses to devices that are connected to the network. Most networks\ninclude a DHCP server to manage IP addresses. When a DHCP server is available on the\nnetwork, DHCP is the preferred IP address assignment mode.\n\nWhen using DHCP, no setup is required to lease and use a dynamic IP address. In a dynamic\nIP operation, the IP address in use may change from use to use. The DHCP server hands out\nIP addresses on a first come, first served basis. As soon as the device is disconnected from the\nnetwork, the IP address that it was using becomes available to lease to the next unit that\nrequests an IP address. Normally, some amount of lag time is present on the DHCP server\nend, so if the device is connected again reasonably soon, then it may end up with the same\naddress.\n\nWhen a DHCP server is not available, a Static IP address can be used. A Static IP address is\na fixed address. After being set, it will always remain the same, and care must be taken to not\nconflict with other equipment on the network.\n\nWhen using a static IP address on an established network, always request the Static IP\naddress from the network administrator. Randomly choosing a Static IP address on an\nestablished network may result in duplicate IP addresses or other conflicts.\n\nThree parameters must be set prior to using a Static IP address:\n\nIP Address\nThis is the Static IP address on the network.\n\nDefault Gateway\n\nOften when a static IP address is assigned, a default gateway is also identified. If the\ndefault gateway is unknown, then type in the Static IP address so that the Static IP\naddress and Default Gateway are the same number.\n\nSubnet Mask\n\nThis parameter is usually extracted from the Static IP address based on the class of the\naddress and determines the destination of any broadcast messages that might be sent\nfrom the instrument. It can be customized if necessary. The subnet mask may also be\nprovided with the Static IP address.\n\nExample 1\n\nIn this example, a Static IP address has been chosen because no network DHCP service is\navailable. The instrument is connected to the network port on the PC with a crossover\nEthernet cable (not included). This is also referred to as Direct Connect:\n\nIP Address: 10.0.0.2\nDefault Gateway: 10.0.0.2\n\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.0.0\n\n \n\nSpectrum Master UG PN: 10580-00277 Rev. E C-5",
    "Page_104": "ipconfig Tool\n\nExample 2\n\nIn this example, the Static IP address has been assigned with an associated gateway and\nsubnet mask:\n\nIP Address: 153.56.100.42\nDefault Gateway: 153.56.100.1\n\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.252.0\n\nC-4 ipconfig Tool\n\nA few tools that are built into the Microsoft Windows operating system can assist in making\nsome determinations about the network to which the PC is connected. Typing ipconfig at a\ncommand prompt produces a display of information about the in-use parameters of the PC\nand its network connection. Following is an example of the typical results expected:\n\n \n\nThe ipconfig display does not report whether the information is from a DHCP\n\nNote server or from a Static IP setup.\n\n \n\nY:\\>ipconfig\nWindows 2000 IP Configuration\n\nEthernet adapter Local Area Connection:\n\nConnection-specific DNS Suffix. : us.anritsu.com\nIP Address. . ...... . . . . 1: 172.26.202.172\nSubnet Mask . ....... . 2. . : 255.255.252.0\nDefault Gateway ...... . . . : 172.26.200.1\n\n \n\nC-6 PN: 10580-00277 Rev.

    "Page_105": "Ping Tool\n\nPing Tool\n\nAnother tool that can find out if a selected IP address is already on the network is ping. Ping\nis a harmless way to determine if an address is found on the network, and (if it is found) to\nreceive a reply. Basically, the ping function sends out a request to a specific address to\ndetermine if a computing device is connected to the network at that address. If a valid\nconnection is found, then a copy of the signal (that was sent) is returned. If a connection is not\nfound, then the response is “request timed out”, which means that no reply was received from\nthat IP address.\n\nY:\\sping 172.26.202.172\n\nPinging 172.26.202.172 with 32 bytes of data:\n\nReply from 172.26.202.172: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128\nReply from 172.26.202.172: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128\nReply from 172.26.202.172: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128\nReply from 172.26.202.172: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128\nPing statistics for 172.26.202.172:\n\nPackets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\nApproximate round trip times in milliseconds:\n\nMinimum = 0 ms, Maximum = 0 ms, Average = 0 ms\n\n \n\nSpectrum Master UG PN: 10580-00277 Rev.
