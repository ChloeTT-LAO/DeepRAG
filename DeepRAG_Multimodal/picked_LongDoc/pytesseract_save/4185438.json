The most straightforward examples arise in arithmetic, but\nthere are numerous other examples which are not as obvious. In this chapter we\nstart our study of group theory by looking at a number of concrete situations\nwhere an algebraic structure arises naturally. We will see that all these algebraic\nstructures share common features, and these common features will lead us to\nthe definition of a group in Chapter 2.\n\n1.1 Symmetry\n\nYou are familiar, at least in an informal way, with the idea of symmetry from\nEuclidean geometry and calculus. For example, the letter “A” has reflective\nsymmetry in its vertical axis, “E” has reflective symmetry in its horizontal axis,\n“N” has rotational symmetry of 7 radians about its centre, “H” has all three\ntypes of symmetry, and the letter “F” has none of these symmetries.\n\nSymmetry is also important in understanding real world phenomena. As\nsome examples:\n\n \n\ne The symmetries of molecules can affect possible chemical reactions. For\nexample, many proteins and amino acids (the basic building blocks of life)\nhave “left-handed” and “right-handed” versions which are reflections of\none-another. Life on earth uses the “left-handed” versions almost exclu-\nsively.\n\ne Crystals have very strong symmetries, largely determined by the symme-\ntries of the atoms or molecules of which the crystal is built.\n\ne Most animals and plants have some sort of symmetry in their body-shapes,\nalthough they are never perfectly symmetrical. Most animals have bi-\nlateral symmetry, while plants often have five-fold or six-fold rotational\nsymmetry.",
    "Page_6": "Notation: Many algebra texts\nwrite ST for To S, because S is\napplied first, then T. In these\nnotes, however, we will remain\nconsistent with the traditional\nfunction composition order, but\nyou must keep this clear in your\nhead to avoid confusion.\nAnother commonly used\nconvention in algebra is to apply\nfunctions on the right, so T(«) is\nwritten as xT, so that S(T(«))\nwould be written as TS.\n\n2 Introduction\n\ne In art and design, symmetrical patterns are often found to be more pleas-\ning to the eye than asymmetrical patterns, or simply more practical.\n\ne Waves in fluids, and the vibrations of a drumhead or string are often\nsymmetrical, or built out of symmetric components. These symmetries\nare usually inherent in the underlying equations that we use to model\nsuch systems, and understanding the symmetry can be crucial in finding\nsolutions to these equations.\n\nBut what, precisely, do we mean by symmetry?\n\nDefinition 1.1\nLet 2 be a subset of R”. A symmetry of 2 is a function T : R\" — R” such\nthat\n\n(i) {T (a): a@ €Q} =Q, and\n\n(ii) T preserves distances between points: if d(x, y) is the distance between\nthe points x and y, then d(T(),T(y)) = d(a, y).\n\nWe denote the set of all symmetries of 2 by Sym(Q). Every set 9 has at least\none symmetry, the identity symmetry I(x) = x.\n\nFunctions which preserve distance are called isometries, so every symmetry\nis an isometry.\n\nProposition 1.1\nLet Q be a subset of R\", and let S and T be symmetries of 2.

We\nobserve that T-1(Q) = T~1(T(Q)) = Q, and also that d(T-!(x),T-+(y)) =\nd(T(T-'(x)),T(T-*(y))) = d(x, y). Hence T~! is a symmetry of 2.\n\nParts (iii) and (iv) are left as a simple exercise. |\n\nWe will usually write the composed symmetry ToS as simply T'S. Remember\nthat because function composition works from right to left, TS means that the\nsymmetry S is applied first, followed by the symmetry T.\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

You should have come across the formal definitions of these\nconcepts in previous courses, such as a typical discrete mathematics course. A\nlarge part of the discussion in this section and the next will be to fix notation\nand terminology.\n\nA set is a collection of mathematical objects. We do not care about the order\nthat the objects are presented, nor any potential duplication of elements. The\nmathematical objects contained in a set S are called the elements or members\nof a set, and write « € S to say that x is an element of S. We say that two sets\nare equal if they have exactly the same elements.\n\nThe simplest way to present a set is as a list of all the elements of the set\nenclosed in braces, such as the set {1,2,3}. For sets with large numbers of\nelements, or infinite sets, this presentation is tedious (or impossible!), so there\nare two alternatives. If there is a clear pattern to the elements, one can use\nellipses to elide the majority of the set, leaving just enough to make the pattern\nof elements clear:\n\n{2,4,6,...,100} and — {2,3,5, 7,11, 13,17...}\n\nare clearly meant to represent the set of all even numbers from 2 to 100, and the\nset of all prime numbers respectively. However some sets are too complicated\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

In set\nbuilder notation we simply specify the set by some property P which defines\nthe set:\n\n{x|x satisfies P} or {x : x satisfies P}.\n\nFor example, one could write the set of all prime numbers as\n{z|x is prime},\nor the set of all numbers greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10 as\n{x:2<a < 10}.\n\nThis last example illustrates an ambiguity: which collection of numbers do we\nmean? Integers? Rational numbers? Real numbers? To resolve this ambiguity,\nwe usually specify the set S from which we take our elements, and use the\nnotation\n\n{x € S|x satisfies P} or {x € S': x satisfies P}.\n\nTherefore the interval of all real numbers greater than 2 and less than or equal\nto 10 would most clearly be represented by\n\n{cE R:2<a< 10}.\n\nThere are several special sets that come up with sufficient frequency to de-\nserve their own notation.

Another way of saying this is that a permutation of\nX is simply a bijection p: X — X.\n\nNormally we are interested only in permutations of finite sets, and we really\nonly care how many elements there are to permute.

If p and q are permu-\ntations of the same set, pq(k) is the what you get from applying q to p(k), ie.\npg(k) = q(p(k)), so pg = qo p (note the reversal of terms in the product versus\nthe composition).\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

Indeed, the inverses of each element\nhave the same pattern under these same correspondences.\n\nIn other words, if we look at these two examples abstractly, we seem to be\ngetting the same underlying mathematical object.\n\nThis correspondence can be made even more concrete in the following way: if\nwe label the vertices of the equilateral triangle of Example[I.2] with the numbers\n1, 2 and 3, starting at (0,0) and working clockwise, we find that the symmetries\nof the triangle permute the vertices in exactly the same way that the corre-\nsponding permutations permute the corresponding numbers. ©\n\n1.4.1 Cycles\n\nEven with the current notation, expressing and working with permutations can\nbe cumbersome. There is another, alternative, notation which can speed up the\nprocess of working with permutations. This notation works by looking at the\ncycles withing a permutation. If p is a permutation of the set X, the cycle of\nan element k of X in p is the sequence of elements (k, p(k), p?(k),.--,p'\"(k))\n(where p! is the product of p with itself | times) such that m is the smallest\nnumber such that, p'*1(k) = k.\n\nNote that the order of the elements in a cycle is important, but not where\nwe start in the cycle. For example, we regard (k, p(k), p?(k),...,p'™(k)), (p(k),\np?(k),..-,p™(k),k), (p?(k),--.,p'™(k),k, p(k)), etc. as representing the same\ncycle. If X is the set {1,2,...n}, it is usual to write a cycle starting with the\nsmallest number in the cycle.\n\nA cycle with m elements is called an m-cycle. A 2-cycle is sometimes called\na transposition, since it transposes two elements.\n\nExample 1.11\nIn the following permutation\n\n123 45 67 8\n2468 75 3 1\nwe have 1 > 2,2 — 4, 4 8 and 8 — 1, so (1,2,4,8) is a cycle. We could also\nwrite this cycle as (2,4, 8,1), (4,8,1,2), or (8,1, 2,4).\nThe smallest element not in this cycle is 3, and we have 3 — 6,6 - 5,5 —7\nand 7 — 3, so (3,6,5,7) is another cycle.\n\nSince every element is in one of these two cycles, these are the only cycles\nin this permutation. ©\n\nIf we find all of the cycles of a permutation, we can represent the permutation\nas a whole as a product of its cycles. But to do that we need to understand how\nto multiply cycles.\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",
    "Page_19": "1.4. Permutations 15\n\nTo work out how a product of cycles permutes a particular element k, all you\nneed do is work from left to right until you find the element in a cycle, and then\nfind the element which follows it in that cycle. You continue from left to right\nstarting with the the next cycle looking for an occurrence of the new element.\nIf there is, then you find the element which follows it in the cycle. Continue on\nin this fashion until you run out of cycles. The final value of the element is the\nimage of k under the product of cycles.\n\nExample 1.12\n\nConsider the permutation p = (1, 3,5)(2)(4, 6) of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}. We\ncan calculate p(1) be looking at the first cycle, where we see that the element\nafter 1 in that cycle is 3, and we also note that 3 does not occur in any cycle\nafter the first, so p(1) = 3. Similarly, we have p(2) = 2, p(3) = 5, p(4) = 6,\np(5) = 1 and p(6) = 4. This permutation could also be written as\n\n©\n\nNotice that there would be no difference in the above example if the cycle\n(2) was omitted. It is common practise to leave such single-element cycles out,\nparticularly when the set which is being permuted is clear.\n\nExample 1.13\n\nConsider the product of cycles p = (1,3, 5)(2, 3)(4, 6, 5) in the set {1, 2,3, 4,5,\n6}. We can calculate p(1) be looking at the first cycle, where we see that the\nelement after 1 in that cycle is 3; however 3 occurs in the second cycle, and the\nelement after it in the cycle is 2; and 2 does not occur in the remaining cycle, so\np(1) = 2. Similarly, we have 3 — 5 in the first cycle, and 5 — 4 in the last cycle,\nso p(3) = 4. Calculating everything out, we have p(2) = 3, p(4) = 6, p(5) = 1\nand p(6) = 5. This permutation could also be written as\n\nor more simply in cycle notation as (1, 2,3, 4,6, 5). 2\nAny permutation can be written as a product of the cycles it contains.\n\nTheorem 1.4\nEvery permutation of S;, can be written as a product of disjoint cycles.

Then pq is given by the\nproduct of cycles (1, 4, 6)(3, 5) (1, 2, 4)(3, 6, 5).\n\nStarting with 1, we see that 1 — 4 — 1, so the first cycle of the standard\nform is just (1).\n\nLooking at 2 next, we have 2 — 4, so the next cycle starts (2,4,...).

Now starting with 5 we get 5 — 3 — 6, so 6 is next in the cycle.\nContinuing in this manner we get 6 — 1 — 2, and 2 is the start of the cycle, so\nthe finished cycle is (2,4, 5,6).\n\nThe only remaining number is 3, so (3) must be the last cycle.\n\nHence pg = (1)(2,4,5,6)(3), which we will usually just write as pg =\n(2, 4, 5,6).\n\nSimilarly we have that gp = (1, 2, 4)(3, 6, 5)(1, 4, 6)(3, 5), and we have 1 — 2,\n2—>4—6,6—-5 — 3 and 3 > 6 — 1, so the first cycle is (1,2, 6,3).

But this implies that 7; = x2, so T is\none-to-one.\n\nIf x, y and z € R” are the vertices of a triangle, then T(x), T(y) and T(z) are\nvertices of a triangle as well, and since d(T'(x),T(y)) = d(x, y), d(I(2),T(z)) =\nd(x,z), and d(T(y),T(z)) = d(y,z), the triangles are congruent. From this\nobservation, it follows that any parallelogram z,y, z, w € R” is congruent to\nthe corresponding parallelogram T(x),T(y), T(z), T(w).\n\nIf T(0) = 0 then this means that in particular, the parallelogram 0, 2,\nx+y, y is congruent to the parallelogram 0, T(x), T(x + y), T(y). Therefore,\ncomparing opposite sides, T(y) = T(x + y) — T(x), or T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y).\nAlso, the “triangle” with vertices 0, x, Ax is congruent to the triangle with\nvertices 0, T(x), T(Ax), but since the vertices of the first triangle are collinear,\nso must the vertices of the second, so T(Ax) is a scalar multiple of T(x), and\nd(T(Ax),0) = |Ald(x,0), so T(Av) = +Ax. However, if T(Ax) = —Azx, then\nlooking at the corresponding sides x to Ax and T(x) to T(Ax), we would have\nd(T (Ax), T(x)) = |A + 1]d(x,0), rather than | — 1|d(a,0).\n\nHence if T(0) = 0, T is a linear transformation, and a linear transformation\nfrom R” to R” which preserves distance is orthogonal and hence onto.\n\nIf T(0) = c, then the function S(a) = T(x) — ¢ preserves distances, and\nS(0) = 0, so S is orthogonal and hence onto. But then T(x) = S(a) + ¢, so\ngiven any y, there is some x such that S(x) = y—c, and so T(x) = S(x) +c=\n(y—c) +c=y. Hence T is onto. |\n\n \n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

In this endeavour, we discover\nthat there are certain rules which always apply, such as the commutative and\nassociative laws of addition and multiplication, and that these laws allow us to\nmanipulate and simplify algebraic expressions. As we learn more mathematics,\nwe see similar rules appear over and over again.\n\nIn abstract algebra, instead of concentrating on specific algebraic settings\n(such as algebra with numbers, vectors or, now, permutations or symmetries) we\ninstead look at the rules of algebra and ask what we can infer from reasonable\ncollections of such rules. We can then apply the knowledge so gained to a\nsurprisingly wide collection of concrete situations which happen to satisfy such\nrules.\n\n‘You may have already seen such an approach in linear algebra, where one\neventually considers abstract vector spaces (as opposed to concrete ones, such\nas R”). One then finds that, for example, that differentiable functions form a\nvector space, and that differentiation and integration are linear transformations,\ngiving new (and quite important) insight into calculus.\n\nOur starting point, then will be the group, an object which encapsulates a\nreasonable set of rules for a single algebraic operation.\n\n2.1 Binary Operations\n\nA binary operation is a type of function that we shall be using regularly.

Working With Abstract Groups 39\n\n2.3 Working With Abstract Groups\n\nA lot of the content of group theory involves proving general facts about groups.\nThe point of this section is to make you familiar with the sorts of techniques\nand proof methods involved. Unfortunately, even the most “obvious” and basic\nfacts need careful checking, since we have stripped away most of the standard\nrules of algebra.\n\nConsider the cancellation law:\n\nProposition 2.3 (Cancellation Law)\nLet (G,*,e) be a group, and x, y, andz € G. Ifexz=yx*z, then x = y.\nSimilarly, if z* 2 = z*y, then x = y.\n\nNormally you would cancel like this in algebra without too much thought:\nthe case z = 0 for multiplication is really the only exceptional case in standard\nalgebra. However we need to carefully justify that cancellation in fact works for\ngroups.\n\nProof:\nWe have\ncT=Uxke (identity axiom)\n\n=ax(z*2!) (inverse axiom)\n=(x*z)*271 (associativity)\n=(yxz)xz! (hypothesis)\n=y*(z*271) (associativity)\n=y*e (inverse axiom)\n=y. (identity axiom)\n\nThe second part is left as an exercise. a\n\nNotice how each step is justified in terms of the axioms of a group. Needless\nto say, once you get more familiar with the way that group operations work, you\nwill not need to justify each step, and you may be able to skip certain trivial\nsteps. In the short term, however, you should be careful that you justify each\nstep in any calculation.\n\nHere is another example: it should be fairly obvious that there can only be\none inverse of any particular element. Nevertheless, we need to prove this result.\n\nProposition 2.4 (The Inverse is Unique)\n\nLet (G,*,e) be a group, and x, y€ G. Then ifa*y=e, y=2~'.

We would like\nto develop some way that we can present groups abstractly, without worrying\nabout any potential context.\n\nFor finite groups, one way of doing this is by giving a Cayley table for the\ngroup.\nDefinition 2.1\nLet (G,*,e) be a finite group of order n, with some particular ordering 21,\nX2,.-.,£,, Chosen for the elements of G. Then a Cayley table of the group is an\narray where x; * x; is in the ith row and jth column.\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

If G and H\nare isomorphic, and H and F are isomorphic, than G and F must also be\nisomorphic.\n\nThis is not the final version of the definition of “isomorphic”, but it will do\nfor now.\n\nExample 2.16\nThe groups S3 and Sym(Q), where ( is an equilateral triangle, are isomor-\nphic. ©\n\nExample 2.17\nConsider the Cayley tables of Z4 and the group of symmetries of the H-\nshaped set of Example [1.1]\n\n \n\n+|0 1 2 3 o|I H V_R\n0/0 12 3 I/l HV R\n1/1 2 3 0 H|H IRV\n2}2 301 ViJV RI\n3/3 0 1 2 R|R V HI\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

Hence x must occur exactly once.\n\nA similar argument proves the result for columns. |\n\nAnother way of saying this is that a Cayley table is a Latin square: a Latin\nsquare is an array of symbols in which every symbol occurs exactly once in each\nrow and in each column.

In both\ncases the objects were defined in terms of axioms which must hold for various\nbinary operations. In both cases we have a concept called isomorphism which\ntells us when two groups or two vector spaces are essentially the same.\n\nIndeed, if you think about it, the concept of generating sets and spanning\nsets are somewhat analogous: a set generates G if you can get every element\nof G by applying the group operations to the elements of the generating set;\nwhile a set spans a vector space V if you can get every element of V by applying\nlinear operations (vector addition and scalar multiplication) to the elements of\nthe spanning set.\n\nClearly we should be careful not to take such analogies too far, since groups\nand vector spaces are different, but the analogies are useful for putting the next\nfew sections into context.\n\nIn the theory of vector spaces, there are three concepts we have not yet seen\nin the context of groups:\n\ne direct sums of vector spaces: if V and W are vector spaces, we have the\ndirect sum V @W which is the set V x W together with appropriate vector\n\nspace operations.\n\ne subspaces: a subspace of a vector space is a subset which is also a vector\nspace.\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

If we define a binary operation e on\nG x H by\n\n(91,1) # (g2,h2) = (gi * ga, o ha),\n\nthen Gx H = (Gx H,e,(e,1)) is a group, and the inverse of (g,h) is (g~1,h7!).\n\n \n\nProof:\n\nThe binary operation e is obviously well defined, so we only need to check\nthat the three axioms hold.\n\nAssociativity follows directly from the associativity of G and H:\n\n((g1, hi) © (92, h2)) © (93, ha) = (91 * 2, hi © ha) # (93, hs)\n\n= ((g1 * g2) * 93, (Ri © ha) o hg)\n= (91 * (92 * 93), ha 0 (ha ohs))\n= (g1,h1) © (92 * 3, h2 ° hs)\n=(\n\ngi, hi) © (92, h2) © (93, hs))\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

Equiva-\nlence relations are a powerful mathematical concept which occur with regularity\nthroughout abstract mathematics. Moreover, you are familiar with some of them\nalready, even though you may have not seen the concept formally explained.\n\nDefinition 3.7\nAn equivalence relation on a set X is a relation R on X which is reflexive,\ntransitive and symmetric. Equivalence relations are often denoted by the symbol\n\nExample 3.28\nThe equality relation is an equivalence relation. Indeed, it is the prototypical\nequivalence relation. °\n\nExample 3.29\n\nLet M,,(R) be the set of n by n real-valued matrices. Recall that A and B are\nequivalent matrices if there is an orthogonal matrix U such that A = U~!BU.\nThe relation ~ defined by A ~ B if and only if A and B are equivalence matrices\nis an equivalence relation. °\n\nExample 3.30\n\nLet m be any natural number. The relation = on Z defined by x = y if and\nonly if m divides x — y is an equivalence relation. Another way of looking at it,\nis that it holds if and only if\n\nx=y (modm).\n\nA third, useful, way of looking at this situation is that the set of all integers\ndivisible by m is the subset H = mZ = {mn : n € Z} of Z, and this is a\nsubgroup, so a = y if and only if  — y € H, and x — y is the additive notation\nfor zy~!. So this is the same condition we were using to test whether two\n\nelements were in the same coset. 2\n\nWe now get to the key example which links this section with what we have\njust discussed by generalizing the above example.\n\nExample 3.31\n\nLet G be a group, H a subgroup of G, and x, y € G. We define t =p y\n(mod H) if zy\"! € H.\n\nTo prove this, you need to check that each of the three axioms for an equiv-\nalence relation hold.\n\nFirstly, ex~! =e € H, sox =p x (mod A), and =pR (mod H) is reflexive.\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

The equivalence class of x € X is the\nset\n\n[|v = {ye Xia ~y}.\n\nWhen the equivalence relation is clear, we typically write just [x].\n\nExample 3.32\nFor equality, the equivalence class [z]_ = {x}. ©\n\nExample 3.33\nFor = (mod m), the equivalence class of a number n, [n]= is the set of all\nnumbers with the same remainder when divided by m, or equivalently,\n\n{n] = {...,n-—2m,n—m,n,n+m,n+2m,...}\n\nExample 3.34\n\nThe equivalence class of x under the equivalence relation =p (mod H) is\nthe right coset Hx.\n\nThe equivalence class of x under the equivalence relation =; (mod H) is\nthe left coset rH. °\n\nA key fact about equivalence classes is that they partition the set X into a\ndisjoint collection of subsets whose union is the whole set.\n\nLemma 3.32\nLet ~ be an equivalence relation on X.

In this chapter we look at other ways to\nconstruct new groups from already known groups.\n\n4.1 Quotient Groups\n\nLet G be a group, and N a normal subgroup of G. We can (at least potentially)\ndefine a binary operation * on the set of cosets of N by\nNax* Ny = Ney.\nThe difficulty with this definition is that there may be many different choices\nfor x’ and y’, so that Na’ = Nx and Ny = Ny’, and it is not immediate why\nwe should have Nxy = Nay’. However they are in fact equal since x’ = ux and\ny’ = vy for some u and v € N, and since N is normal, we have z = ava! € N,\nso\ntt -1\nay = uxvy = urva ry = (uz)ry,\nso Na'y’ = N(uz)ry = Nay. So * is a well-defined binary operation, and it is\n\nonly well-defined if N is normal.\n\nProposition 4.1\nLet G be a group and N a normal subgroup of G. Let G/N be the set of all\ncosets of N in G. Then (G/N, *, N) is a group.\n\na first observe that G/N is associative, since for any right cosets Nx, Ny\nand Nz € G/N, we have\n(Na *« Ny) * Nz = Nay* Nz = Nayz = Na x Nyz = Naxx (Ny* Nz).\nThe set N is an identity, since N = Ne, and so\nNex Nx = Nex = Na andNa * Ne = Nae = Na.\n\n117",

If we consider cosets\nNa and Ny, then we have that the product of the cosets as sets is\n\n(Na)(Ny) = (@N)(Ny) = (@N?)y = (aN )y = (Na)y = Nay,\n\nrecalling that Na = aN since N is normal, and N? = N since N is a subgroup.\nIn other words, Na *« Ny is given by the product of sets (Nx)(Ny). In some\ntexts this is used as the definition of the product.\n\nDefinition 4.1\nIfG is a group, and N a normal subgroup of G, then we call G/N the quotient\ngroup of N inG.\n\nExample 4.1\nLet Dg = {1,a,a7,b, ab, ab} as usual.

Wl\n\nCorollary 4.3\nA subgroup N of a group G is normal if and only if it is the kernel of some\nhomomorphism.\n\nThe relationship between quotient groups and homomorphisms is signifi-\ncantly deeper than this corollary, however. These relationships are encapsulated\nin a trilogy of theorems called the Isomorphism Theorems. Unfortunately there\nis little consensus about which of the three should be first, second and third.\n\nTheorem 4.4 (First Isomorphism Theorem)\nLet G and H be groups, and a: G — H a homomorphism. Then\n\na(G) = G/kera.\n\nProof:\n\nFor simplicity of notation, let N = kera.\n\nWe would like to define a function 6 : G/kera > a(G) by 6(Nx) = a(c),\nbut it’s not clear that this is a well-defined function. To verify that this definition\nis good, we need to show that if Nx = Ny then 6(Nx) = 3(Ny) so that the\nvalue of 3 does not depend on the choice of x.\n\nNow if Na = Ny we have that xy~! € N, so a(ry~+) =e, and hence\n\na(y) = ea(y) = a(xy™*)aly) = a(ay~*y) = a(z).\n\nSo we conclude that if Nx = Ny then beta(Nx) = 3(Ny), and so (3 is well-\ndefined.\nFurthermore, 3 is a homomorphism, since\n\n8(Na * Ny) = B(Nay) = a(2y) = a(x)a(y) = 6(N2) (Ny).\n\nWe also have that is onto, since if y € a(G), then y = a(x) for some x € G,\nbut then y = G(Nz).\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",

Hence 3 is one-to-one.\nSo @ is an isomorphism, and we conclude that G/kera = a(G). |\n\nWe will now turn to look at how the subgroup structure of G and the\nsubgroup structure of G/N are related. Letting a : G > G/N be given by\na(x) = Na, we have that if H < G, then a(H) < G/N and if K C G/N then\na~1(K) < G from Propositions and [2.26] A deeper question is if there is\nany relationship between normal subgroups of G and normal subgroups of G/N.\n\n \n\nProposition 4.5\n\nLet G be a group and N a normal subgroup of G. Then every subgroup of N\nis equal to K/N where for some K with N < K < G. Furthermore K/N is\nnormal if and only if K is normal.\n\nProof:\n\nLet a: G > G/N be given by a(x) = Na.\n\nLet H be a subgroup of G/N, and let K = a~1(H), so that K is a subgroup\nof G, and since N = a~!({e}) C a71(H), so N < K. So H = a(K) and if we\nrestrict a to K, the First Isomorphism Theorem tells us that\n\na(K) = K/N.\n\nFurthermore, recall from the proof of the First Isomorphism Theorem that this\nisomorphism is given by 6(Na) = a(x), and a(x) = Nz, so (3 is just the identity\nmap, and so H = K/N.\n\nIf K is normal in G, then a~!Ka = K for each x € G, and so\n\n(Naa!) * a(K) * (Naz) = a(x7!) * a(K) * a(x) = a(a Ka) = a(K),\nso H = a(K) is normal in G/N.\nConversely, if H = K/N is normal in G/N, then Theorem tells us\nimmediately that a~!(H) = K is normal in G. a\n\nNow if N < K <G, as in the last part of the Proposition, we note that N\nis normal when regarded as a subgroup of K also, and so we can take three\nquotients: G/N, G/K and K/N. The Second Isomorphism Theorem gives us a\nrelationship between these three quotients.\n\nTheorem 4.6 (Second Isomorphism Theorem)\nLet G be a group and N and K normal subgroups of G with N < Kk.

    "Page_125": "4.1. Quotient Groups 121\n\nProof:\n\nWe first note that since K is normal, the previous proposition tells us that\nK/N is normal in G/N, and so (G/N)/(K/N) is defined.\n\nWe would like to define a function a : G/N — G/K by a(Na) = Kz, but\nonce again we must be careful that this well-defined, since there are multiple\npossible choices for x which give the same coset Nx. If Nx = Ny, then we\nrecall that ry~! € N, and so xy~! € K as well. So K = K(xy™?),\n\na(Ny) = Ky = (Kary\"')y = Ka = a(Ny).\n\nSo this is a well-defined function.\nFurthermore, a is a homomorphism, since\n\na(Na * Ny) = a(Nay) = Key = Kx x Ky =a(Na) x a(Ny).\n\nWe observe that a(N«) = K if and only if « € K, or equivalently, Na € K/N.\nBut this means that kera = K/N. We also have that since every coset of K is\nof the form Ka for some x € G, we have that a(G/N) = {a(Na): a € G} =\n{Ka :x € G} = G/K, so a is onto.\n\nNow the First Isomorphism Theorem tells us that\n\na(G/N) = (G/N)/kera,\nBut we know that a(G/N) = G/K and kera = K/N, so\nG/K © (G/N)(K/N).\na\n\nNote that this theorem essentially says that the quotient operation cancels\nin the way that you would expect a quotient to cancel: if G, K and N were\nnumbers you would expect the same equation to hold.\n\nWe can also ask what happens if K is a general subgroup of G. In this case\nwe can’t talk about K/N, since we may not have N C K. However we do know\nthat the meet of K and N is a subgroup of kK. Indeed we have that for any\nx €K,andy€ KAN we have that x~'yx € K, since K is a subgroup. But\nwe also have that x~!yx € N, since N is normal. Hence K A N is a normal\nsubgroup of the subgroup Kk’. So we can consider the quotient group K/(K AN).\nSimilarly, although N is not a subgroup of K’, we know that N V K contains N,\nand since N is normal, we can consider the quotient group (K V N)/N.\n\nTheorem 4.7 (Third Isomorphism Theorem)\nLet G be a group, K a subgroup of G and N a normal subgroup of G.

Then\nG/Z(G) cannot be cyclic.\n\nProof:\n\nWe first recall that Z(G) is always normal, so G/Z(G) is defined. If G/Z(G)\nis cyclic, then we can find an element t so that Z(G)t generates G/Z(G), and so\nevery coset of Z(G) is of the form Z7(G)t* for some k. But then given arbitrary\nelements x and y € G, we have that x = ut* and y = vt! for some u and\nv € Z(G).

But if\n|Z(G)| = p, then G is not Abelian, and we have that |G/Z(G)| = |G|/|Z(G)| =\np/p = p, so G/Z(G) must be a cyclic group of order p.

Any automorphism has to preserve the order of each\nof the elements, and since a? is the only element of order 2, a(a”) = a? for every\nautomorphism a.

They do hold, however, so we have\na functor between the categories.\n\nThis is not the only possible functor between these two categories, since we\ncould also consider a functor which maps a group G to the lattice consisting of\nthe power set P(G) with meet and join being intersection and union. ©\n\nMay 3, 2004 Version 0.6",
