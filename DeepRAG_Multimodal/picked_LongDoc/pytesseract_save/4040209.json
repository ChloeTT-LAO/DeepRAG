Transports goods from within AP to a seaport in other state to export the goods outside the country-\nwhether e-Way bill required for movement of goods vehicle?\n\nAs the dealer in AP is transporting the goods first to the sea port outside the state for the purpose of export,\nthere is an interstate movement. Hence e-Way bill is mandatory. The same is already clarified on 02-04-2015\n\nvide reference 5th cited.\n\n2. Aperson may be registered dealer in other state, but not registered under APVAST Act2005.\n\nIntends to Export goods through a seaport located within the state of Andhra Pradesh-As he is not doing any\nbusiness in AP, he has not taken Registration under APVAT Act2005 and hence cannot obtain e-Way bills. In such a\nsituation How to fulfil the requirement of e-Way bill as per GOMs No 26 dt. 05-02-2015?\n\nIn the instant case, the Exporter is not a dealer in the state of AP and he is transporting his goods from outside the\nstate to the Seaport in AP. Hence as per Rule 55 of APVAT Rules, 2005, there is no need for any Waybill. However, a\ncopy of Export license and Export Invoice or Foreign Buyer purchase Order has to accompany the goods. Further, the\n\nTransporter has to generate declaration in Form 650 electronically by choosing the option “e-Way bill not required”\n\nRegulatory paperwork is based on the Rules and Regulations of the State concerned, prevailing at the present time, as we\nunderstand them to be. State VAT Rules & Regulations are subject to change from time to time. Any variance of law may cause\na corresponding change in regulatory paperwork. Further, practice could be different than the Rules & Regulations in some of\nthe States. Shippers / Consignees are, therefore, advised to seek independent verification also.
