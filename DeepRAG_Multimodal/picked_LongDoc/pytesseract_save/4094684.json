    "Page_7": "Chapter One: Synopsis of Agravio\n\nAgravio is a translation and adaptation of Valor, Agravio y mujer by Ana Caro\nMallén de Soto, a Spanish female poet and playwright who wrote during the 17% century.\nAmy Williamsen began the initial translation of Agravio and this adaptation was realized\nonstage by Jan Borden in 2012. Agravio is Spanish Siglo de Oro Comedia and contains\ntraditional elements of “honour, revenge, love triangles, and intrigue” as well as plot\n\ntwists and clever, “conniving” servants. (Jeffs).\n\nAna Caro was born about 1600 and is believed to have died in 1652. Valor,\nAgravio y mujer was published between 1680 and 1700 (Jeffs, “Ana Caro”). She was\nfrom a noble family and privately educated, since learning institutions were not open to\nwomen at that time and she wrote in Portuguese, French, and Spanish. While Agravio\nemploys familiar themes including the restoration of a woman’s honor, Ana Caro\nmanipulated gender roles to afford the female protagonist the ability and means to do\n\nwhat she needs and wants (in Leonora’s case, to seek revenge).\n\nI asked the director, Ian Borden, to tell me how he discovered this play and\n\nworked on the new adaptation:\n\n“T came upon this play at ASTR [American Society for Theatre Research] in\n2009. Amy Williamsen had done a translation that was pretty hard to get\nthrough—too literal. So she and I worked on a more feasible translation. That’s\nwhen I changed [a male character] Ribete to Flora disguised as Ribete—this\nallowed for casting 4 men, 4 women. [...] What attracted me to the play has\n\nalways been the same—Leonora having the guts to go after what she needs and",
    "Page_8": "literally fight for what she wants, and the general sense of fun and play in the\nscript. [...] A couple of other things changed, though. 1) Leonor became Leonora\nand I generally made her less hard edged. 2) The balcony scene went from four\ncharacters to six, which allowed the romantic relationships to be seen so that what\nwas originally a mercenary set of match ups at the end felt more like four love\n\nmatches, something that modern audiences are more comfortable with.”\n\nProfessor Borden’s adaptation remains faithful to Ana Caro’s depiction of the\nempowered woman and goes further by building in another strong female character in the\nform of Flora. With eight dominant characters onstage played by eight strong actors, my\nchallenge was to match the energy level, the fun, and the sense of play generated by this\n\ncombination with equally fun, playful, and energetic costumes.\nSynopsis\n\nAgravio takes place in Spain and a region referred to as Flanders.’ The\nstory begins with Leonora de Ribera stalking onto the stage, proclaiming her need for\nrevenge against her lover, Don Juan, who has gone off to Flanders leaving Leonora in a\n\nconvent hiding her shame from her family.\n\nLeonora is determined to follow Don Juan to Flanders and avenge herself on Don\nJuan. Her servant, Flora, suggests she go disguised as a man and to that end Flora fetches\nmen’s garments which were left at the convent. Donning a man’s doublet and\n\ncommandeering a sword, Leonora takes on the persona of Don Leonardo and insists that\n\n* Professor Borden notes, “Caro’s audience would have recognized Flandes as the area that was under\ndispute between the English, Dutch, French and Spanish. This region is now roughly found in southern\nBelgium. Also, the opening scene in Spain did not exist in Caro’s version.”",
    "Page_9": "Flora accompany her to Flanders dressed as Don Leonardo’s manservant, Ribete. The\n\nplan, and the plot of the play, is thus set in motion.\n\nIn the wilderness outside of Flanders, the Condesa Estela and her cousin Lisarda\nget lost while out hunting. They are accosted by three bandits—Rufino, Astolfo, and\nTibaldo—and subsequently rescued by Don Juan, who was sleeping nearby. Don\nFernando, a member of the royal court, comes to the rescue a little too late and mistaking\nDon Juan for a bandit, duels with him. Estela clears up the misunderstanding and\nFernando’s gratitude compels him to accept Don Juan into the inner workings of the\ncourt. Prince Ludovico arrives accompanied by Don Juan’s servant, Tomillo, and whisks\n\nEstela and Lisarda back to the palace in his carriage.\n\nLeonora and Flora, as Don Leonardo and Ribete, subsequently arrive in Flanders.\nThey hide while Ludovico and Don Fernando discuss Don Juan. It seems Estela has made\nDon Juan her steward as a reward for his bravery. This tears at Ludovico’s heart as he is\nmadly in love with her. Don Fernando offers to help Ludovico with his cause, in spite of\nthe fact that he is also secretly in love with Estela. Leonora/Leonardo introduces herself\nto Don Fernando and discovers that he is actually her brother who left home when she\nwas young. She does not share this discovery with Don Fernando, however, and he\n\ncordially invites Leonardo to bunk with Don Juan; the plot thickens.\n\nLisarda and Estela spend some time in the garden engaged in girl talk, mostly\nabout who Estela does and doesn’t “like.” Don Fernando arrives to woo Estela on Prince\nLudovico and Don Juan’s behalf and discovers that Estela is smitten with Don Leonardo.\n\nLeonora/Leonardo plays on Estela’s affection and Ludovico’s obsession and plots a",
    "Page_10": "rendezvous that night with Ludovico who will pretend to be Leonardo. Flora/Ribete gives\nDon Juan a paper from “the Condesa Estela” which asks him to meet her in the garden\n\nthat night. Little does he know, he will be meeting Leonora instead.\n\nNight has fallen and Leonora/Leonardo encounters Don Juan in the square. Out of\nthe blue, Leonora calls Don Juan a deceiver and a liar and by drawing her blade\nchallenges him to a duel. They fight, and Leonora wounds him. Ludovico, who stumbles\nonto the scene, is delighted with this and decides to remove Don Juan as a possible suitor\nto Estela by killing him. Leonora then vigorously defends Don Juan and fights with\n\nLudovico, much to the confusion of Ludovico and Don Juan.\n\nAct 2 opens with the balcony scene, that same night, in which Estela and Lisarda\nappear on one side of the stage and Leonora on the other. Ludovico proceeds to woo\nEstela with Fernando’s reluctant assistance, except Estela thinks Ludovico is Leonardo.\nLisarda speaks for Estela and in her earnestness, accidently calls “Leonardo” Ludovico,\nwho is the secret object of Lisarda’s affection. Meanwhile Leonora, whom Don Juan\nthinks is Estela, is bringing Don Juan to task for jilting Leonora. The scene ends with\nLeonora—still pretending to be Estela—spurning Don Juan while at the other balcony,\nDon Fernando climbs up and shares a kiss with Estela, who still thinks the\n\nLudovico/Fernando duo is Leonardo.\n\nThe next morning brings everyone together in turn, further complicating matters\nand leading to a sword fight between Don Leonardo and Don Juan over the honor of the\nabsent Leonora. Then Tomillo shows up, passes out, and Flora, dressed in her gown,\n\nstrips him of his purse and his clothes and dons them herself. Through this encounter,",
    "Page_11": "using her wit, she convinces Tomillo to swear that if he ever meets a woman more clever\n\nthan he, he will marry her.\n\nFollowing this lighthearted scene, Leonora/Leonardo and Don Juan engage in\nmore swordplay, interrupted by Don Fernando. To justify the duel, Don Leonardo claims\nthat he is defending the honor of Don Fernando’s sister Leonora. By this admission, Don\nJuan discovers that Don Fernando is the brother of the woman he has offended back in\nSeville. Prince Ludovico, Don Leonardo, Don Fernando, and Don Juan engage ina\ncommunal stand-off, swords drawn, until Leonardo goes off to fetch Leonora, who is\n\n“nearer than you think.”\n\nWhile Leonora is gone, Tomillo, who suspects Ribete is Flora in disguise, rips\nopen Ribete/Flora’s jacket to reveal a flowery corset. Don Fernando can wait no longer\nand proceeds to defend his sister’s honor in a duel with Don Juan. The duel grows heated\n\nuntil Leonora returns, dressed in her gown, and reveals her true identity.\n\nDon Juan and Leonora are happily reunited, Estela discovers that the kiss she\nshared on the balcony the night before was not with Don Leonardo, but Don Fernando,\nand is delighted to have found her true love, and Prince Ludovico is rewarded with the\ndiscovery that charming Lisarda is in love with him. Tomillo and Flora are bound\n\ntogether with a dowry provided by Estela, and they all live happily ever after.\n\nWith the combination of swordplay and mistaken identities, Agravio initially\nseemed to be a blend of Twelfth Night and The Three Musketeers. However, the more\ntimes I read the script, and the more research | did on Spain in the 17th century as well as\n\nresearch on Ana Caro herself, the more Agravio’s distinct traits came to the forefront.",

    "Page_13": "Chapter 2: Research of the Spanish Golden Age\n\nThe script indicates that the initial version of Agravio was written ca. 1637-1650.\nThis encompasses approximately the same time period as The Three Musketeers, which\nthe Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film presented in Spring 2011. I was wary of\nduplicating the look of The Three Musketeers, both for the sake of our audience and to\ngive costume technicians the design and construction knowledge for a different period. I\nasked the director if he would be willing to move the play backwards in time. He agreed,\nand asked me to keep him informed as to how that would affect the costumes in terms of\n\nfootwear, collars, and so forth.\n\nMy initial research covered from 1400-1650 and focused on Spain, with forays\ninto France and England. I examined historical texts, costume history, and books on the\narts. For about 100 years, from the late sixteenth through the seventeenth century, Spain\nexperienced el siglo de oro, the Spanish Golden Age. During this time, literature and art\nflourished. It was also the time of Spain’s greatest influence on the fashions of Europe,\nespecially England and France. “Under Charles V and his successor, Philip II, Spain was\nthe most powerful state in Europe ... Spanish etiquette was rigid and unbending, and\nSpanish costume was no less so” (Keniper 81). Philip II, who ruled Spain circa 1556-\n1665, collected paintings and sculpture and was dedicated to beauty in the form of\ngardens and architecture. He supervised the construction and decoration of El Escorial?\noutside of Madrid, which was built to serve as a palace, monastery, and mausoleum.\nPhilip II filled the palace with art, including many commissioned pieces. By 1580, Spain\n\nhad won an important battle with the Ottoman Turks, and had united with Portugal.\n\n? See The Story of Spain, Chapter Six.",

Also, there would be greater\n\npotential for using some of the garments from the costume shop inventory.\n\nIn the late 16th century, men wore linen shirts that were cut full and gathered into\na band at the neck and cuffs. The shirt was covered by a jerkin or a vest, and a doublet\n\nwhich was\n\n“tight-fitting to a very narrow waist, buttoned down the front from a high collar\n\nand developing skirts [peplums] which varied from very short to hip-length; the",

A short cape was worn “on both shoulders, on\none alone, or draped about the bust” (Kelly 18). Men wore hose which were some sort of\nbreeches and stockings stitched together. The styles varied from trunk hose, which were\nshort and wide and often paned?, to Venetians which tapered to the knee and were worn\nsnug to the skin or very wide. Boots were mid-thigh but could be folded down and did\nnot typically have a heel. Hair was cut short and flat caps or hats with high, stiff crowns\n\nwere worn.\n\n \n\nFigure 2.2: Anonymous.

Ruffs were the height\n\nof fashion during this period and are prominent in many portraits of the day.\n\nI gathered many images to present to the director, including those of 17th century\ncavaliers that I did not want to see onstage. In addition to providing the director with\nhistorical images, I viewed video clips or the entirety of three recent films. From these I\ngathered still photos that would convey the impression (from La Conjura de E] Escorial\nor The Conspiracy) and the color (from Elizabeth: The Golden Age) that I felt would\n\nmesh with the script.",
    "Page_17": "13\n\nThe director’s concern was how\nto make the men look manly to a\nmodern audience. He felt that the men’s\nhose would appear feminine to the\naudience. To address this concern, I\ndesigned Venetians, below knee length\nbreeches for Don Juan, Don Fernando,\nand Tomillo, while reserving the trunk\nhose for Prince Ludovico. Since\n\nLudovico had both feet firmly planted\n\n \n\nin the 16th century aesthetic, I decided it\n\nFigure 2.10: Braun and Schneider. The History of\nCostume.Plate 46c, French Court Dress.

I designed more\nopen necklines for Leonora and Lisarda, a softer, less\n\nconfining neck for Estela and combined color, soft\n\n  \n   \n\nFigure 2.11: Michael Dahl, fabrics, and romantic trim such as lace and embroidery to\nPrincess Anne, c. 1690.\n\nCommons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:\nPrincess Anne _c.1690.jpg.\n\n \n\nachieve the goal.\n\nWhile the standard in fashion for late 16th\ncentury Spain was a short hair length for men, the\ndirector wanted to keep Ludovico’s hair long. This was\nnot my first choice, but it helped establish the distinct\ncharacter of Ludovico, who resides in Flanders. The\nhairstyle for the servant Tomillo came directly from the\nFigure 2.12: Sofonisba Anguissola.\n\nIsabel von Valois, 1599.\nCommons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Is\n\nabel_von Valois by Sofonisba_Ang\nuissola.jpq.\n\nactor’s own shock of unruly hair, which suited the\n\ncharacter perfectly.\n\nAs for the women’s hair, I wanted it to be polished, yet practical.

It is the\nimage that ties Don Juan and Leonora to the rest of the characters who are represented\n\nin images and color on the lower half of the board.\n\nIn an early email to the director, I asked if he preferred to see color matching for\ncouples. He said the costume matching for couples need not be obvious, that the\ncoordination could be subtle using trim, patterns, or line rather than simply color. His\nprimary concern was that when the couples stand together at the end of the show, they\nshould visibly appear as though they are with the correct person. Because Agravio\nincorporates so many plot twists, I wanted to cast some doubt on who will end up with\n\nwhom; therefore I attempted to keep the color coordination of couples rather subtle.\n\nA blueprint of my initial color preferences by couple set the tone for subsequent\ndesign choices and fabric selection: Leonora would be in soft red leaning to orange, with\naccents of blue, while Don Juan was in blue with red accents; Estela would be dressed in\naqua leaning to blue, with brown or gold added, with Don Fernando in green with gold\naccents; Lisarda would be in gold blending with pink plus shades of rose and coral, while\nLudovico was in purple; Flora would embody rich earth tones such as rust and dull\ngoldenrod yellow while Tomillo was primarily brown. I planned to further tie the couples\ntogether visually with similar neutrals, specifically tan, cream, black, copper, gold, and\n\nsilver.",
    "Page_24": "20\n\nChapter 4: Reflecting the Passage of Time\n\nOne of the aspects of costuming any play is not only the time period in which it is\nset, but the amount of time that passes onstage from beginning to end. For Agravio, the\ndirector said that time was malleable. Leonora and Flora leave Seville after 1.1 (At the\nConvent) and arrive in Flanders in 1.3 (Arriving at Court). He also indicated the time\nspent in Flanders could be a week, but noted that the same night which ends Act 1 also\n\nbegins Act 2. From there, time accelerates and Act 2 encompasses only one day.\n\nDue to budget considerations, I planned that one major costume piece per\ncharacter would be worn throughout the show. This would also provide visual continuity\nbetween acts. Don Juan, Don Fernando, and Ludovico retained their breeches while\nEstela and Lisarda each continued to wear the same skirts. At first glance it appeared that\nintermission would be the ideal time to change costumes. However, this would typically\nimply a new day or some other transition which, in the world of the play, did not happen\nuntil after 2.1 (The Balcony Scene). The director and I discussed having everyone change\nprior to 1.5 (First Night/Fighting in the Dark) but there was no time to do so. Intermission\ncould not be moved up because that would make the first half of the play too long and the\n\nsecond half entirely too short.\n\nWe concluded that because 2.1 (The Balcony Scene) is so dimly lit it would be\nacceptable for Estela and Lisarda to change their bodices at intermission without creating\na visual discontinuity. The three male characters that were changing doublets would\nremove their capes and hats for 2.1, and change their doublets backstage prior to 2.2 (The\n\nNext Moming). Discarding the capes facilitated the quick changes for Don Juan and Don",

Coordination of preset garments and hats with the\nlocation and timing of each character’s exits and entrances was necessary and\n\nsuccessfully achieved with the cooperation of the actors and the costume crew.\n\nAt intermission, Leonora removed her doublet to reveal her chemise and corset\nand added her underskirt over her pants and boots. This facilitated her change back into\n\nLeonardo which necessitated presetting her doublet, hat, and sword back stage left.",
    "Page_26": "Chapter 5: Leonora\n\nAccording to the director, Dona Leonora is in her\ntwenties. She is hell bent on revenge against Don\nJuan, who has left her to join the Spanish army.\nShe is also madly in love with Don Juan. Leonora\nis a determined, feisty, sentimental woman. The\nactor, Kayla Klammer, was a petite young\nwoman, so the challenges were not to overwhelm\nher in her 16th century dress and to make her\n\nbelievably masculine as Don Leonardo.\n\nI initially designed Leonora’s gown in red\nwith blue accents while Don Juan, her lover, was\npredominantly blue with red accents. This was a\nway to tie them together without being blatant,\nand to leave some question, however small, as to\nhow this situation would be resolved. I saw\nLeonora as a fiery, lively young woman and I\nwanted to reflect that in her dress. However,\nJanice Stauffer, my advisor, felt this was the\n\nwrong approach. She saw Leonora as an\n\n22\n\nFigure 5.1: Leonora Preliminary Sketch for\n1.1\n\nFigure 5.2: Leonora Preliminary Sketch for\nFinal Scene\n\n“ingénue” and said that making her dress blue would show her youth.

    "Page_27": "23\n\nIn the first rendering and construction\ndrawings of Leonora’s dress, I designed the sleeves\nin the same blue fabric as the skirt with silver piping\nor bands of fabric between the puffs. The costume\nshop supervisor was unable to manipulate this fabric\nto successfully achieve the proportions as designed,\nso Professor Stauffer suggested that the sleeves be\n\nconstructed from the silver brocade used for the\n\n \n\ncenter and back of the bodice and the front of the\n\nFigure 5.3: Leonora Initial Rendering overskirt, and that we build only two puffs into the\nsleeve instead of the three I had designed. I went\nalong with this decision. The bodice also incorporated blue velvet for the peplum and the\n\ntrim on the collar and sleeves.\n\nIt was difficult to find blue fabric at the time. I finally discovered blue embossed\nvelveteen in Lincoln. I used this fabric for the overskirt and the bodice in conjunction\nwith the silver brocade. I stitched metallic gold and blue trim to the front and back of the\nbodice and to the vertical edges of the skirt to contrast with the silver brocade.

For instance, Kayla/Leonora’s belt\nwas at her waist so that she could reach the hilt of her sword while the men’s sword belts\nwere at their hips. Thus the men’s peplums on their doublets were frequently a bit\nrumpled beneath the sword belt while Leonora/Leonardo’s costume did not have that\nissue. This did not create a distraction though, as the audience was far too captivated with\n\nthe actors’ performances to focus on their peplums and the placement of the belts.\n\nIt was important to provide the actual belts to the actors from the beginning of\nrehearsals so that the Prop Master could work with the belts on the actors and so the\nactors could get accustomed to the feel long before they moved their swordplay up to\nspeed. For the same reason, it was important to also provide rehearsal boots and shoes,\ngloves, hats, and capes as soon as possible. The actors’ footwear needed to fit their feet,\nnot slip, and be flexible enough to allow for vigorous movement. For the performance, I\nborrowed boots from the School of Music opera department for Don Juan and Don\nFernando, found boots in stock for Tomillo, purchased boots for Leonora/Leonardo, and\nfound vintage shoes in stock for Ludovico. These boots and shoes were given to the\n\nactors far in advance of tech week.",
    "Page_61": "57\n\nGloves needed to fit the actor’s hands and allow for safe combat with swords\nand/or daggers. The gloves also needed to slip into their belts when not being worn. I\nfound suitable gloves in stock. Hats needed to be secure for combat and not block their\nvision or be a distraction. Ludovico’s hat was a challenge because of its height, but it was\n\nquite secure on the actor’s head.\n\nAll of the actors involved in combat wore capes at some point during the play. I\nwanted the capes to have visible, functional ties. However, it was more important for the\ncapes not to be a hindrance to the fight choreography. Therefore, in addition to the\nfunctional ties, I added snaps to the capes and doublets and sewed small, discreet stitches\nto particular folds to maintain the structure of the capes while allowing movement. All of\n\nthe actors had access to a mock-up of the capes for rehearsal purposes.\n\nI was concerned about the safety of panes on Ludovico’s trunk hose in combat.\nWould they interfere with the actors’ movement? Would the sword get caught in the\npanes? The director assured me that it would not be a problem and indeed, it was not. I\nmade certain the panes were long enough to look good and be functional, and short\nenough not to get caught on anything. The actor fully cooperated with multiple fittings of\nthe muslin and the finished garment during which I encouraged him to reenact his\n\nchoreography to check for any potential problems.",
    "Page_62": "58\nChapter 13: Double cast in the Wilderness: Costuming the Banditos\n\nSince three of the four male actors in the show were double cast as bandits, their\nappearance as such had to be distinctly different from their primary characters in every\nway. The disguise needed to cover their main costume and hair completely while keeping\ncombat safety in mind. All costume pieces were pulled from stock; some were rigged to\n\nfacilitate quick changes.\n\nThe actor portraying Tomillo needed to\nbecome Tibaldo, a bandit, between 1.2A (The\nWilderness) and 1.2B (Attacked in the\nWilderness). Following 1.2B, Tomillo must be\nrestored for his entrance in 1.2C (The Rescue).\nThe actor had to overdress with a tunic,\nbreeches, a hat, a cape, and gloves. He wore the\n\nsame boots, but added and removed a sword belt\n\n \n\nduring the changes.\n\nFigure 13.1: Tomillo in the guise of\nTibaldo, a bandit\n(Photo Courtesy of Alma Cerretta)",
    "Page_63": "59\n\nDon Fernando and Ludovico were able to\nbegin the show overdressed as Rufino and Astolfo,\nthe other two bandits. The actor playing Don\nFernando overdressed with breeches, a tunic and\nvest, a hat, and gloves. He also needed to add and\nremove a gun holster and two guns. The addition of\nVelcro to Don Fernando/Rufino’s shirt facilitated\n\nhis 38-second quick change.\n\nLudovico/A stolfo was overdressed in a\n\n \n\ntunic and vest, breeches, a hat, gloves, a rope belt,\n\nFigure 13.2: Don Femando in the guise of\nRufino (Photo Courtesy of Alma Cerretta) . .\nand boots. The actor had slightly more time, from\n\n1.2B (Attacked in the Wilderness) to 1.3B\n(Meeting Fernando), to remove the overdressed\ngarments. He also had to change his footwear\nand add his sword belt and a cape prior to\n\nreturning to the stage.\n\nIt was necessary to coordinate these\nchanges in location and timing and to provide\nbackstage assistance for the actors. These quick\nchanges were choreographed during a rehearsal\n\nand required four crew members to assist. The\n\n   \n\nFigure 13.3: Ludovico in the guise of A stolfo\n\nquick changes worked very well.\n(Photo Courtesy of Alma Cerretta)",
    "Page_64": "60\nChapter 14: Flora Tricks Tomillo\n\nIn Act 2, Scene 3, Flora strips Tomillo of his clothes and his belongings to teach\nhim a lesson. While Tomillo is “passed out,” Flora, now dressed as a woman, undresses\nhim down to his underwear and dons his clothes. This scene presented the greatest\n\ncostuming challenge of the play as all of this activity takes place onstage.\n\nTomillo’s jerkin required multiple pockets purposed to hold items such as a purse,\na deck of cards, and a real sausage. The pockets were built into the lining of the jerkin.\nItems in the pockets were removed by Flora prior to undressing Tomillo, thus the pockets\ncould not be too deep or too far back from the opening of the jerkin, and fasteners on the\npockets were simple snaps. The tunic/jerkin combination also must be washable, thus\ninfluencing both the design and fabric choices. The tunic was constructed of polyester,\nthe jerkin was a rough looking but soft poly/cotton blend, and the lining was goldenrod-\nyellow cotton. In order to facilitate the process, the actor discarded his undershirt prior to\nthe scene, we stitched his jerkin to his tunic at the sides and the back, attached his belt to\nthe jerkin with belt loops, and the bottom button of the jerkin was rigged to be a snap.\nFlora had to unbuckle the belt, remove the tunic and jerkin over Tomillo’s head, and put\n\nthem on over her bodice.\n\nFlora also removed Tomillo’s boots and pants. The boots were loose enough for\neasy removal, but not so loose as to hinder the actor’s activities onstage. Tomillo’s pants\nmust fit him and stay up without the addition of suspenders, be removed easily onstage,\nand be worn by Flora through the end of the scene. This was accomplished by building\n\nelastic as well as a drawstring into the waistband of the pants.",
    "Page_65": "61\n\nFlora’s dress was constructed in two pieces as a bodice and skirt to facilitate quick\nchanges. It was not clear at first whether or not she would be putting Tomillo’s pants on\nbeneath her skirt prior to removing it, but the bulk of the trousers necessitated the\nremoval of the skirt first. I provided pink bloomers for Flora to wear beneath her skirt, a\nfeminine contrast to the very masculine garments she is putting on. The actor put her skirt\nin Tomillo’s gunny sack (which was lined to protect the skirt) and carried it offstage with\n\nher. The costume crew hung the skirt and brushed off any stage dirt nightly.\n\nI spent time with the actors independently and with the actors and director at\nrehearsals to assist with choreographing the scene, and supplied them with rehearsal\n\ngarments from the beginning, as well as the actual garments as soon as they were\n\nconstructed.\n\n \n\nFigure 15.1: Flora Tricks Tomillo (Photo Courtesy of Doug Smith)",
    "Page_66": "62\nChapter 15: The Hair Conundrum\n\nBilly Jones, who played Don Fernando and Lucy Myrtue as Estela have similarly\nfair coloring and looked more like brother and sister than potential lovers. Also,\nBilly/Don Fernando needed to look as though he and Kayla/Leonora were brother and\nsister. Therefore, Billy’s hair would need to be dyed darker. The director also wanted\nKayla/Leonora’s hair to be darker. For both Billy and Kayla, I provided Jan with images\nand he selected the shade. The same hair stylist worked on both actors. I provided the\nstylist with the approved images of the color and cut, as well as a photograph of\n\nLucy/Estela to clarify the desired contrast between Estela and Don Fernando.\n\nBecause Billy’s facial hair was equally blonde, it needed to be colored as well,\nsince I did not want to use any false hair in the production. I chose to use waterproof\nmascara on his eyelashes, eyebrows, and all facial hair. I taught the actor how to apply it,\nand from dress rehearsals through the run of the show he did a terrific job. It did not\n\nsmear or run and came off cleanly with baby wipes.\n\n   \n\nFigure 14.1: Billy/Don Femando, Before Figure 14.2: Billy/Don Fernando, A fter\n(Photo Courtesy of Julie Douglass) (Photo Courtesy of Julie Douglass)\n\n \n\n4",
    "Page_67": "63\nChapter 16: Preparation of the Actors and the Rehearsal Process\n\nI presented the costume renderings to the cast for the first time at their first\n\nrehearsal. At that time, I read the following quote:\n\n“The way reconstructions are worn is crucial to their success as communication\ntools. Standing up straight, keeping still, walking as though God is ever watching,\nand respectfully reverencing ones betters with a bow or curtsy were all necessary\n\nto avoid drawing critical attention to oneself in the 16° century” (Mikhaila 10).\n\nIn order to help the actors inhabit their garments in the spirit of the 16th century, I\nprovided rehearsal garments and accessories from the beginning of the process. This\nincluded corsets, hoop skirts, a regular skirt for Flora, hats, bags, belts, gloves, shoes or\nboots, underwear, a tunic and a sports coat for Tomillo, and a jerkin and other items for\nuse in 1.1 (At the Convent). As soon as actual costume pieces were available, I allowed\nthe actors to wear them in order to make the transition from rehearsal to performance as\nseamless as possible. The women wearing hoop skirts learned how to sit on low steps and\na planter in the skirts, as well as how to navigate the stairs backstage and share space on\nthe balconies. Lucy Myrtue/Estela commented that the actors would automatically stand\n\nfurther apart after being in hoop skirts during rehearsal.\n\nFlora needed to appear to be in her early 40s. However, the first night we applied\nage makeup, the director thought she actually looked younger than Leonora. A fter that,\n\nthe actress applied the age makeup more sparingly and that gave the right effect.",
    "Page_68": "64\n\nChapter 17: Conclusion\n\nCostuming a play which had not been done before was a unique experience in\nmany ways. Since | rarely look at previous productions of anything that I costume, this\nwas not an issue. However, I wanted to stay consistent with any established notions of\nSpanish Comedia. Finding information about Spanish theatre proved to be most\nchallenging. The only sources I found were on the internet and the accompanying\nphotographs displayed nothing out of the ordinary. For Spanish history, art, and costume\n\nhistory, I found adequate resources in the Daniel Boone Library in Columbia, Missouri.\n\nThe timeline for costuming Agravio was a hindrance. I received my script\nassignment the final week of the Spring semester 2012 and did not meet with any\nmembers of the production staff until the first week of the Fall semester due to Summer\nbreak. I had previously worked as a team with both the Scenic and Lighting Designers as\nwell as the Stage Manager, so the pressure was somewhat alleviated as we were all\nfamiliar with each other’s style and work ethic. However, some of the problems could\n\nhave been avoided with regular meetings.\n\nFor instance, due to the presence of the balconies, there had to be stairs both on\nand offstage. The rises for the stairs were designed much too high for actors in hoop\nskirts and had to be reconfigured. The width of the stairs was initially designed to be 26”\nand the skirt circumferences were at least 3 feet. I worked with the Technical Director to\n\nidentify areas that needed careful sanding to avoid snagging the satin garments.\n\nThe Lighting Designer did not return to campus until the second week of\n\nthe semester. However, she was reliable and consistent in her communication of ideas,",
    "Page_69": "65\n\nand once in town she held a meeting immediately which was extraordinarily helpful. I\ngave her fabric swatches attached to brown paper and together we conducted a lighting\ntest of the fabrics far in advance of light hang.\n\nThe Stage Manager, Fred Drenkow, was crucial to the communication process. I\nspoke to or texted with him daily. Together we coordinated entrances and exits with\ncostume presets and quick changes. Fred was responsible for scheduling all fittings\nexcept for the impromptu fittings which inevitably occurred. Fred and I kept the lines of\ncommunication open at all times.\n\nCommunication with the director over the summer was problematic but\nsuccessful. I needed to compile all of my research images, which were primarily in books\nin Missouri, and get them to Professor Borden in South Dakota. I did not have access to a\nscanner during this time, so I found all of the images from the books online and emailed\n\nthem to Borden for his perusal.\n\nI prepared an image board consisting of colors, patterns, and other images\ndesigned to impart my overall mental image of the play. I also created sketches with a\nfew fabric swatches prior to our first meeting in August 2012. Borden’s verbal comments\non the board and the sketches combined with his feedback over the summer provided a\n\ngreat foundation for proceeding with my renderings.\n\nCommunication with the costume shop was essential. To that end, Professor\nStauffer asked me to create construction drawings as well, rather than relying on the\ncustomary method of displaying only the renderings and the source images. At the\nbeginning of the construction process, I created a Make/Pull/Purchase List for the\n\ncostume shop supervisor and periodically consulted with her over the list. As we drew",
    "Page_70": "66\n\nnear to dress rehearsal, I created daily to-do lists and posted them in the shop. In addition,\nI attached hand-written notes to each garment in an attempt to accurately convey what\nneeded to be done. All of these methods combined proved to be generally helpful, but I\nstill needed to be in the shop at all times for consultation on the construction of the\ngarments. I also posted a short synopsis of the play in an attempt to bring the characters\n\nto life for the workers in the costume shop.\n\nTwo respondents from KCACTF (Kennedy Center All College Theatre Festival)\nreviewed Agravio. The first respondent was Patrick Carriere from Minnesota State\nUniversity. Mr. Carriere said he missed seeing fans and mantillas onstage, though he\nunderstood that my goal was not to be strictly realistic in the representation of Spanish\ncostumes. He liked the colors and the trims, and could see the nod to reality in the detail\nof the costumes. Regarding the “buffoon” characters (Flora and Tomillo) he said, “good\ncostuming.” He felt the proportion of Tomillo’s garments helped the scene—that when\nFlora puts on his clothes ‘“‘it’s funny.” The second respondent was Julie Mollenkamp from\nthe University of Central Missouri. She said the “massive period costumes” made a big\ndifference about which Lucy Myrtue (Estela) commented, “We were in hoop skirts the\nwhole time and you could tell [because] when we weren’t, we wouldn’t stand that close\ntogether.” Dr. Mollenkamp also commented on the hats casting shadows but agreed that\nshe didn’t know how to resolve that issue. She said the costumes exhibited stunning\ndetail, that they were “spot on; you didn’t miss a trick.” She enjoyed the color palette and\n\nsaid it was “tremendously impressive work.”",
    "Page_71": "67\n\nThe costumes for Agravio were nominated for participation in the costume parade\nat KCACTF in Lincoln, Nebraska in 2013. I received a Certificate of Merit from\n\nKCACTF for Achievement in Costume Design for Agravio.",

    "Page_106": "102\n\n \n\n \n\nAgravio Synopsis\n\nThe original version of Agravio, which is Spanish Commedia, took\nplace in Spain in the early 1600s. Our version is a new translation by\nlan Borden et al. We decided to set the play in 1560-1580 Spain,\nhowever we are stretching the boundaries of historical fact for\ntheatrical effect as well as ease of production and believability by a\n21° century audience.\n\nLeonora (Kayla Klammer) seeks revenge on Don] uan (David\nMichael F ox) after he pledges his love then runs off to join the\nSpanish Army. At her servant Flora’s (Jenny Holm) behest, she\ndresses as a man, “Don Leonardo” in order to pursue said revenge.\nFlora must then dress as her male servant, “Ribete”.\n\nIn Seville, they encounter Don J uan, his servant Tomillo (Shade\nIngraham,) Don Fernando (Billy J ones)—Leonora’s older brother who\nleft home when she was six and thus won't recognize her, the\nContessa Estela (Lucy Myrtue), her dreamy cousin Lisarda (Lauren\nHuston), and Prince Ludovico (Patrick Stayer).\n\nThere are thieves & rescues, everyone falls in love with everyone\nelse (love quadrangles? ), mistaken-identity romances ensue, and\nsword fights occur as often as possible. It probably ends “happily ever\nafter’, like all good fairy tales!\n\n \n\nFigure F-2: Synopsis for Costume Shop Technicians",
