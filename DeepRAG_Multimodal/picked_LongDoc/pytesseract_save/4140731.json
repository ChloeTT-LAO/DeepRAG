Our website, www.u3ac.org.uk, gives full details of the\norganisation — how we are run, our history, our constitution, policies and our annual report and accounts.\nIt is the place to go for up-to-date information about our courses, lectures, social and cultural activities,\nprivacy policy, public liability insurance etc.\n\nThe annual subscription\n\nThe annual subscription for 2021-2022 is £95. New members pay an additional enrolment fee of £5. A\nreduced rate subscription is available for members in receipt of pension credit. To qualify for the reduced\nsubscription of 20% of the full rate (£19), contact the Office with evidence of your entitlement. If you enrol\nonline, you will be refunded the difference when the relevant documentation has been received.\n\nThe annual membership subscription contributes to the administration and accommodation costs of U3AC\nand is non-refundable. Itis not a payment for individual classes, lectures or activities.\n\nApplying for courses\n\nFor existing members\n\nApplications should be submitted via the website, www.u3ac.org.uk, no later than 13 August.\n\nPlease note: If you apply for only one course, and that course has a limited number of places, we cannot\nguarantee that you will be allocated a place. It is therefore advisable to list an alternative.\n\n1. Log on to the website using your username and password (if you have forgotten your password,\nclick Forgotten Password).\n2. Click 'Course selection’. Select the courses you want to apply for. You can choose a maximum\n\nof 6:\n\ne Make sure their times do not clash.\n\ne If two are on the same day, ensure that you have time to get from one to the next.\n\ne Rank your courses in order of preference with your first choice at the top of the list. You can\nchange the order of preference by dragging the courses you have selected up and down the\nlist.\n\n3. If you wish, enter an alternative course in the right-hand column. The alternative should be either:\n\nsimilar to the course in the first column and you don’t mind which one you attend, including the\n\nsame course which is offered both on Zoom and face-to-face\n\nor\n\nat the same time as the course in the first column.\n\nClick the ‘Submit course choices’ button at the bottom of the screen.\n\nPay the annual subscription, and any additional course fees via PayPal, using your credit card or\n\ndebit card (you do not need to have a PayPal account).\n\n6. Once payment has been made via PayPal you will be taken back to the U3AC website to\ncomplete the payment and submit your application.\n\nup\n\nFor new members\nYou must first register on the website and set up your account:\n\n1. Click | oin U3AC on the homepage.\n\n2. Complete the two parts of the online registration form (‘Your info’ and ‘Additional Information’).\nDon’t forget to click the Submit button at the bottom of the Additional Information form.\n\n3. Then apply for up to 6 courses, as described in steps 2-6 for existing members above.\n\nAny existing or new member who needs help completing the online form, should telephone the\nOffice on 01223 321587 and a member of staff will be pleased to talk you through the process.\n\nIf you do not have access to the internet, the Office can send you a paper copy of the New member\nregistration and course application form.\n\n2",
    "Page_5": "When to apply\n\nYou can join U3AC at any time and apply for courses. If your course choices are submitted by 13 August,\nthey will be included in the annual allocation process, which uses a computer algorithm. If they are\nsubmitted after the allocation process, some courses will be full, so itis best to check first with the Office.\nIf you have made your application by 13 August, you will be sent your membership card in September,\nwith a list of the courses on which you have a place.\n\nThe vacancy list, available from September, shows courses that still have vacancies. If you apply for a\ncourse that is full, you will be placed on the waiting list.\n\nCourse allocation\n\nThe computer algorithm used to allocate courses works as follows:\n\n1. It finds all members who have placed a particular course as their first choice.\n\n2. I|fthere are more applicants than places on the course, the algorithm selects names at random\nfrom the list of applicants.\n\n3. Ifthe course still has empty places, applications from members who put it as their second choice\nare considered, and so on.\n\n4. |f you are not allocated a place on your chosen course, your name is added to the waiting list,\nunless you have listed an alternative course in the second column. In this case the alternative\ncourse will be substituted for the course in the first column and you will not be put on the waiting\nlist.\n\n5. To make the course allocation more evenly balanced, the algorithm holds a ‘success number’ for\neach member. This is initially set to zero. Each time a member is allocated a place on a course,\ntheir success number increases by 1. Members who have a lower success number (i.e. have not\nbeen allocated their first choice of course, or their alternative first choice) are given priority in the\nallocation of second choice courses, and so are more likely to get these.\n\nOnce you have received your confirmation letter and membership card you may start to attend courses.\nPlease note: The Courses Committee reserves the right to cancel courses whose enrolments fail to\nreach 50% of the allocated capacity.\n\nAttending courses\n\nHealth and safety\nParticipation in all U3AC activities is at your own risk.\n\ne Before taking a fitness course or other physical activity, please consider whether you should\nconsult your GP.\n\ne If you have a significant health concern, please mention this (in confidence) to the course tutor or\norganiser.\n\nIf you are attending a class in the U3AC premises, let Office staff know if you require help should the\npremises need to be evacuated in an emergency by ticking the box on the application form.\n\nMembers with special needs\n\nMany courses can be adapted to cater for members with visual or hearing impairments. Please discuss\nyour needs with the course tutor or organiser.\n\nA table on pages 87 and 88 of this Programme and the course venues page on the website give details\nof each venue’s facilities and accessibility.\n\nWithdrawing from a course\nIf you are not able to attend a course, or if you find it does not meet your needs, let the Office know as\nsoon as possible so your place can be offered to someone on the waiting list.\n\nContacting a tutor\nFor data protection reasons, the tutor’s personal details are not printed in the Programme of Courses.\nInstead, they are available to members who are logged in to the website.\n\ne Log in in the usual way and go to the course description page. The contact details are listed\nunder the tutor’s description.\ne If you do not have internet access you can request this information from the Office.\n\n3",

Mercia was one of three\npowerful Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and came into particular\nprominence during the Mercian supremacy under King\nOffa, when Magdalene Bridge was built and ended in 910\nwithin a single kingdom of England. The course will look at\nthe geographical extent of Mercia to the Welsh border; its\npeoples, its dialect. Northumbria has Bede and Wessex\nthe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Mercia has less documentary\nevidence but its story is now starting to be told with the\nstunning find of the Staffordshire Hoard. Mercia had its\nown distinctive art of high quality, the Tiberius school of\nmanuscripts, including the Book of Cerne and the Barberini\nGospels and an influential style of metalwork, including the\nelegant Trewhiddle style of silver jewellery, that spread\nacross England.

We will consider how writers, patrons, and\ninstitutions shaped their work and continue to influence\nwhat we consider ‘beautiful’ or ‘great art' today.

It\ntakes as its basic assumption that, in practice, economics\nshould have a just and equitable outcome for all those\nparticipating in, or affected by, the economy. Economics is\napproached as a Social study, involving all of humanity, but\nwith humanity seen in the context of its place in nature and\nthe universe. The role of nature as the source of wealth and\nsustainer of life is emphasised.

Spring (5 weeks)\n\nPlaces: 20\n\nStart date: 23 Feb\n\nPhotography, like all of the arts, does not exist in a vacuum,\nyet too often we take photographs at face value, paying\nattention to what they are of rather than what they are\nabout. Photography lives, and has always lived, in a world\nof influences and challenges to which it responds and on\nwhich it, in turn, has an impact. Its story and current\npractice reflect debates around issues such as equality,\nexploitation, censorship and interpretations of history.\nUsually those matters are expressed through the\nphotographs; sometimes they are expressed through the\nlives of the photographers. This course will explore these\nrelationships in five sessions covering: ideas that changed\nphotography; photographs that changed the world; women\nin photography; travellers, exploration and photography;\nand photographic controversy and the bounds of\nacceptability (will include pictures that some may find\noffensive).\n\nFormat: Lecture\n\nAbout me: Brian is an ex-town planner with practical,\nhistorical and academic interests in photography.\n\nPHO 02(z): Photography group (Spring term)\n\nConvenor: Eleni P aliginis\n\nDay and time: Friday 14:00 - 15:30\n\nVenue: Zoom\n\nLength of course: 1 term.

This will not be a taught\ncourse in photography. Some familiarity with the basics of\nphotography will be useful. Participants are expected to\nhave a DSLR or equivalent camera. However some camera\nphones have become very good and give good results,\nparticipants with camera phones are welcome. We will\nhave sessions in landscape, night, street, travel, portrait\nand macro photography. Each week, when we discuss the\nphotos of the participants, we will refer to the best camera\nsettings for the type of photography.

As\na result, British geologists pioneered or ‘colonised’ vast\nstretches of geological time with British names such as\nCambrian and Devonian. William Smith’s 1817 geological\nsection from North Wales to London, roughly along the\nroute of the Irish Mails, was the first to represent the\nsuccession of strata that preserve a good sample of the last\n550 million years of geological time.

Spring (6 weeks)\n\nPlaces: 25\n\nStart date: 18 J an\n\nOne of the gaps identified in the curriculum this year was\n\"Advanced Physics\". It's difficult to do most advanced\nphysics without advanced mathematics, but there is an\nexception. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote a\npaper (often called EPR) showing that the prevailing\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics was inconsistent with\nreality. In 1964, the Irish physicist) ohn Bell generalised\ntheir idea and framed it as a simple experimentally testable\nequation. The result of the experiment was \"Quantum\nMechanics - 1: Reality - 0\". EPR's concept of reality was\nshown to be incorrect. The worrying thing is that this\nincorrect concept might be summed up as \"Things have\nproperties\". After a quick review of quantum mechanics,\nphotons, and polarization, we'll dive into EPR, Bell's work,\nAspect's experiments, and their implications. The concepts\nhere are very challenging but fortunately the maths is\nrelatively easy, trigonometry and probability.\n\nFormat: Lecture\n\nAbout me: I've been working in scientific research for\nabout 50 years; | hope to get a better understanding of the\nEPR paradox by teaching it.\n\nSCE 25(z): The learning brain\n\nTutor: Beverley Steffert\n\nDay and time: Monday 11:30 - 12:30\n\nVenue: Zoom\n\nLength of course: 1 term.
