    "Page_2": "AUTOPORTRET 72 .o\n\n1—2021\n\nQUARTERLY ON\nGOOD SPACE\n\nTHE HOUSING ISSUE\nAFTER 1989\n\n \n\nFor the past year, we spent a lot more time in our homes and our flats; therefore, we\nexperienced all their shortcomings much more acutely. Online meetings revealed\nvarious clever strategies for self-presentation — but they also exposed the impossi-\nble-to-disguise, omnipresent lack of space (Poland has one the smallest average size of\napartments in the EU).\n\nIn this issue we look at housing in the Visegrad countries after 1989: in the Czech\nRepublic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. We analyse the consequences of including\nthese countries in the system of global neoliberalism, particularly in terms of direct\nconsequences for the region’s inhabitants, pertaining to their dwellings.\n\nFormer Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus noted that the apartment is unlike ham;\nwe cannot simply give it up if the price increases. Gaby Khazalova quotes that state-\nment in her text on Czech re-privatization. Indeed, flats have grown more expensive,\nand within a few decades for the majority of Central Europeans they have become a\ncommodity that is hard to afford. It is shocking — but not surprising — to observe how\nsimilar the stories told by our authors from different countries are. The re-privatization,\ngentrification, suburbanization, gated communities and commodification of housing\nhave changed the space in which Central Europeans live. We can point out subtle\ndifferences, compare dynamics, but basically the advent of neoliberalism had the same\noutcome everywhere: it inevitably turned an apartment into a commodity, and a new\nhousing estate into a product. The weaker were relegated to the outskirts, disappear-\ning from the field of visibility. The logic of money took over the space, and both the city\ncentres and suburbs were built using the financial mechanism of mortgage loans.\n\nThe paradigm of values has changed: the place of living, loving, growing up, growing\nold, has become, above all, a resource - something that you can sell, buy, and trade\non the real estate market. In our late, soulless capitalism, this resource is earning us\nmoney even when it remains empty. That is why concrete is being poured everywhere\n(we will soon run out of sand), and blocks of flats are growing, ever thicker and higher\n— containing not only apartments, but also investment properties. Living there is often\ncompared to “cage rearing”. Dysfunctions multiply, yet people do not take to the streets\nto protest about not having access to sunlight and greenery, about the cities becoming\ndeserted, fences growing, and playgrounds located right next to busy thoroughfares.\n\nThree decades after changing the system, we are in the process of a thorough\nre-evaluation of the political and economic paradigm. This issue of “Autoportret” is a\nrecord of the present moment. We analyse processes, we criticize the logic of late cap-\nitalism, but we do not stop at complaining. Our authors’ texts offer outlines of possible\nchanges on many levels: from the vision of cooperative movement (Zofia Piotrowska), to\nthe involvement of the state in the construction of cheap apartments for rent (Zuzanna\nMielczarek, Kamil Trepka), to the postulates of an inclusive city without fences (Agata\nTwardoch), and finally — probably the most difficult task - to a banking system in which\na flat will no longer be a financial instrument (Mikotaj Lewicki). What is more, ready-\nmade solutions already exist, they have been tested, and it would be enough to revive\nor adapt them to our present needs.\n\nThere is a consistent tone throughout the issue: the paradigm of values must be\nchanged. We have to build the foundations of a community. We take the first step: we\nare thinking and talking about housing as a fundamental human right.\n\nDorota Lesniak-Rychlak\n\nPUBLISHER\n“se MIK\n\nMatopolski Instytut Kultury w Krakowie\nul. 28 Lipca 1943, 17c, Krakow\n\ntel.: 012 422 18 84\n\nwww.mik.krakow.pl\n\nINSTYTUGIA KULTURY,\nWOIEWODZTWA MALOPOLSKIEGO\n\nN\\ MALOPOLSKA\n\nADVISORY BOARD\n\nAdam Budak, Andrzej Bulanda,\nWojciech Burszta, David Crowley,\nPiotr Korduba, Ewa Kurytowicz,\n\nMaciej Mitobedzki, Agostino de Rosa,\nEwa Rewers, Tadeusz Stawek,\n\ntukasz Stanek, Magdalena Staniszkis,\nDariusz Smiechowski, Gabriela Switek\n\n \n\nINFO\nwww.autoportret.pl\n\nKult\nriodzict ¢ Visegrad Fund\n\ni Sportu ee.\n\nCo-financed by the Ministry of Culture, National\nHeritage and Sport of the Republic of Poland\n\nThe project is co-financed by the Governments of\nCzechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia through\nVisegrad Grants from International Visegrad\nFund.

    "Page_5": "Poverty, limited access to vital public services,\nand economic inequalities, especially within the\ndomain of housing, are systemic phenomena:\nover the last three decades, a decent house\nthat would offer adequate conditions of health\nand hygiene has become a luxury that fewer\nand fewer people can afford. The privatization\nof the current social housing fund, the govern-\nment’s support almost exclusively for the con-\nstruction of private houses and for real estate\ndevelopers, the encouragement of the transfor-\nmation of the living space into an investment for\nprofit through fiscal measures favourable to this\naim — all these have led to the current state of\naffairs.’\n\nThe above quote comes from the Manifest petru drep-\ntate locativd (Housing Justice Manifesto), published\nlast April by the Romanian network of associations and\ngroups Blocul pentru Locuire (Housing Bloc), fighting\nfor a fair and equitable housing policy in response to\nthe coronavirus pandemic. The latter revealed and\ndeepened the scale of the housing crisis in Romania.\nData published by the Eurostat show that the country\n\nis facing serious problems: in 2018, Romania had the\nhighest share of overcrowded housing among European\nUnion countries (46 per cent) and severe housing depri-\nvation (16 per cent of the population live in overcrowded\napartments with at least one major disadvantage, e.g.\n\na leaking roof, no bathroom or toilet, too dark). Roma-\nnia also had the highest percentage of people at risk of\npoverty and living in overcrowded homes. Having said\nthat, after studying the Eurostat data, we will notice\nthat many countries experience these problems on a\nsimilar scale. In terms of overcrowded housing, Latvia,\nBulgaria, Croatia and Poland are close behind. The\nhighest rates of severe housing deprivation are recorded\nin Latvia, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary and Lithuania. As\nin Romania, alarmingly high numbers of people at risk\nof poverty live in overcrowded flats in Poland, Slovakia\nand Bulgaria.\n\nIt is tempting to interpret these comparisons as\nanother symptom of the “poverty of small Central and\nEastern European countries”, a typically Central Euro-\npean ailment, resulting from the repeatedly described\nstructural backwardness of the entire region. However,\nwhen we also take into account other indicators related\nto the quality of housing, the picture becomes some-\nwhat more complicated: among the countries with the\nhighest financial burden related to the cost of housing\n(expressed in the number of households that spend\nmore than 40 per cent of their income on housing),\nGreece is clearly the leader; excessive costs of housing\n\nalso plague many residents of Great Britain,\nBelgium, and Germany.‘ If we went beyond\n\nEurope and looked at the housing situation on other\ncontinents, it would turn out that the people of Canada,\nKazakhstan, Chile and India would be equally eager to\nsign the manifesto for housing justice. Seen from this\nperspective, housing problems in Central Europe turn\nout to be not an endemic phenomenon, but a part of\nthe global crisis. Former UN Special Rapporteur for the\nright to adequate housing, Raquel Rolnik sees this crisis\nas “the expression and the result of a long process of\ndeconstructing housing as a social good and transform-\ning it into a commodity and financial asset.”>\n\nThis process is inextricably linked with the expan-\nsion of the reactionary political and economic concept\nof neoliberalism. Central European countries played\na special role in the history of commodification and\nfinancialization of housing. By looking at this story, we\ncan illuminate both the key features of the neo-liberal\ndoctrine and the sources of the housing problems we are\ncurrently facing in our region.\n\nThe free market enters people’s\n\nhomes\nThe housing sector has played an important role in\nthis story since the birth of the neo-liberal ideology.\nGenerously financed from public funds as part of the\npost-war welfare policy, for the supporters of free-mar-\nket solutions it has become an example of how not to\norganize social policy. From the 1970s, it was targeted\nby ideologists who were convinced that the state should\ndrastically reduce its expenses, and withdraw from the\nposition of regulator in various areas of social life. It\nwas not only about savings for the budget and opening\na source of potential profits for commercial enterprises.\nThe home was a sphere in which neoliberal doctrine met\ndirectly with the personal, everyday experience of indi-\nviduals, and it could serve as a space for transmission\nand training of the desired norms and attitudes. As a\nresult, writes David Harvey, “all forms of social solidar-\nity” were to be replaced by beliefs in “individualism,\nprivate property, personal responsibility, and family\nvalues.”¢\n\nThe flagship example of neo-liberal housing pol-\nicy —- the “Right to buy” program launched by Margaret\nThatcher in the early 1980s that allowed council tenants\nto buy the flats in which they lived —- opened up space\nfor financial institutions offering mortgage loans, for\nprivate property administrators and commercial con-\nstruction companies, but most of all it made tenants\naware that the relationship between them and the state\nhad changed significantly and that from then on, ensur-\ning proper living conditions for themselves would be\nprimarily on them.\n\nNeoliberal ideologists and economists perceived the\ncountries of Central and Central Eastern Europe, which\nentered the transformation period at the end of the\n\n1980s, as an area of great potential. With huge resources\nin the form of public housing, ranging from 20 per cent\n(in Hungary) to as much as 70 per cent (in Latvia) of\n\nall available apartments, they constituted the perfect\nground to test new market solutions in practice. The\nevents in the region after 1989 are often interpreted as\nan obvious continuation of the neoliberal policies devel-\noping in the West and the inevitable result of geopoliti-\ncal changes. We should remember, however, that these\npolicies had only been implemented in the West for a\ndecade and were still emerging in the process of “chaotic\nexperimentation” at that time.” Thus, the post-commu-\nnist and post-socialist states were not only a place for\nthe implementation of ready-made solutions, but also\n“an important laboratory for creating a new paradigm\nof housing policies, clearly expressed in the documents\nof the World Bank”.8 If we take into account the\n\ncosts of these experiments borne by the inhabitants of\nthe region, we should speak not so much of a laboratory\nas a military training ground.\n\nLet us begin with the assessment that had been at\nthe root of all these experiments. In 1993, the World\nBank published the Housing report. Enabling markets to\nwork, Raquel Rolnik compares its effects to releasing the\ngenie in the bottle.

It was also suggested that spa-\ntial and construction regulations should be “improved”\nand made dependent on economic conditions. The state\nwas expected to withdraw from supporting the con-\nstruction industry, and replace it with “making efforts to\nincrease competition”.\n\nThis set of solutions was part of a broader political\nagenda to no longer view housing as merely “providing\nshelter” or merely as “part of social policy”. Housing as\na “productive sector” was meant to increase the “effi-\nciency of the entire economy”. Thus, the document\ndoes not mention housing as a human right, as a space\nnecessary for physical and mental regeneration, ensur-\ning a sense of security, enabling the fulfilment of human\nneeds, creating and maintaining family ties and social\nbonds. From the specific goals set for the “productive”\nhousing sector, it is clear that the wellbeing of individu-\nals and social groups is subordinated to a wide range of\neconomic indicators; only some of them contribute to its\nimprovement, and not always in a direct way. Although\nthe needs of tenants, here consistently referred to as\nconsumers in accordance with the free market nomen-\nclature, are described in detail, the report does not pro-\npose instruments that would help protect human rights\nin a situation where these needs are in conflict with\nthe interests of financial institutions from the housing\nsector. The latter, on the other hand, are secured bya\nnumber of mechanisms.\n\nWe might say that in terms of “enabling the markets\nto work”, the report brought about tangible results.\nUndoubtedly, the “productive” potential of the hous-\ning sector has been mobilized, and not only in Central\nEurope. Real estate is now ranked among the most\nattractive investments. Its global value is three times\nhigher than the sum of GDP of all countries in the\nworld.’ Satisfying the needs of tenants, though, is not\ngoing so well. “Commodification of housing, together\nwith the increased use of housing as an investment asset\nwithin a globalized financial market, has profoundly\naffected the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing\naround the world,” writes Raquel Rolnik.\"\n\nNeoliberalism commands violence\nAccording to Joanna Kusiak, the limitations of this\nprogram were quickly revealed and subjected to critical\nevaluation even by experts working for the World Bank.”\nSo why did the Central European countries decide to\nimplement housing policies that raised doubts from\nthe very beginning? There were at least several reasons\nfor this. Let us start with one of the most obvious and\nat the same time rather telling: the World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund and many other interna-\ntional financial institutions made debt cancellation or\ngranting new loans for development contingent on the\n\nWERONIKA PARFIANOWICZ\n\nimplementation of the solutions they promoted. That is\nwhy the authors of the Romanian manifesto are calling\ntoday, among other things, that we “condemn and aban-\ndon the stabilization programs [...] imposed by large\ninternational organizations.”\n\nViolence has accompanied the expansion of neo-\nliberal doctrine since its inception, the most dramatic\nexample of which is the coup d’état by General Augusto\nPinochet in Chile in September 1973. The economic\nreforms implemented during his ruthless dictatorship\nbecame prototypes of solutions used later by Western\ngovernments, albeit the latter were elected in accord-\nance with democratic procedures. There, too, economic\nchanges were accompanied by violent social conflicts,\nand the Western authorities reacted by abusing the\napparatus of violence, for example by suppressing\nstrikes and breaking up the trade union movement. Yet\nanother mechanism is the economic violence described\nabove, which takes advantage of the unequal distri-\nbution of power between the state and international\norganizations within the global geopolitical system.\nInstitutions such as the World Bank often resort to this\nkind of violence.\n\nWith the implementation of neoliberal reforms,\nindividuals also experience various types of violence.\nDeprived of sufficient legal protection, tenants are con-\ndemned to living in precarious conditions, to abusive\ncontractual provisions, sometimes even to physical\nviolence. Intimidation or unlawful evictions — which we\nknow, for example, from Polish re-privatization - seen\nfrom a broader perspective, also turn out to bea\nproduct of the functioning of this economic model.\n\nThe murder of Jolanta Brzeska (ten years ago this\nMarch)*8 can also be seen as a consequence of subordi-\nnating human life to the needs of ruthless profits and\nputting the right of private property above the right to\ndecent housing.\n\nNeoliberalism disguises itself well\nOf course, neoliberalism is not only about violence,\nand exposing the mechanisms involved in its various\nforms is often a lengthy process. Both in Central Europe\nand in other parts of the world, free-market reforms\nwere implemented with the support — often enthusias-\ntic - from at least part of the population. This is partly\nbecause this doctrine, which we can define after Stuart\nShields as the process of intensifying the commodi-\nfication of social relations,\" is extremely effective in\nnaturalizing its underlying ideological assumptions and\ntransforming the accompanying norms and values into\na widely shared, “common-sense” vision of reality. It is\ndifficult to find an alternative to it, and it is shared by a\nwide spectrum of social groups, often against their most\nevident self-interest.\n\nIn the West, the ground for the introduction of",
    "Page_7": "pro-market, conservative policies had been prepared\nsince at least since the 1960s, when publications were\ngaining popularity that disavowed the idea of commons\n(like Garret Hardin’s famous Tragedy of Commons), or\nfostered the viewers’ belief that the pursuit of private\nproperty is embedded in human “nature” (like Defen-\nsible Space: Crime Prevention through Urban Design\nby Oscar Newman). They were accompanied by TV\nproductions documenting British council housing com-\nplexes, which have gone dilapidated during the crises of\nthe 1970s. They suggested that a similar fate inevitably\nawaits all public space; therefore, privatization is the\nmost effective way of managing it.5\n\nIt is worth looking at how neoliberal ideology worked\nits way in the countries of Central Europe. Before 1989,\nan ambitious housing policy was an essential element\nof the socialist political project. The authorities of\n\nmost countries in the region built their legitimacy,\namong others, on the foundations of systematically\nimplemented promise to provide housing for everyone,\nregardless of their profession, financial situation, or\nsocial standing. Considering the scale of destruction\nthat the region experienced during World War II, and\nabove all, the catastrophic condition of the economies\nand living conditions in these countries before the war,\nit would be hard not to appreciate the effects of this pol-\nicy. The housing system in Central European countries\nwas not without its drawbacks: flats were often built\nfrom the cheapest materials, their quality left a lot to be\ndesired, the infrastructure accompanying the housing\nestates was built much slower than the residential build-\nings, so tenants sometimes had to wait for years until\nbasic services would be provided in their area. The way\nthe apartments were allocated was also controversial;\n\nnevertheless, during almost the entire socialist period in\nCentral Europe, apartments were built on a mass scale.\nIn Poland, between 1971 and 1980, a total of about 2.5\nmillion apartments were built, and in the record year of\n1978, as many as 248,000 were put into service.\" In 1960,\nHungary embarked on an ambitious “fifteen-year plan”.\nThe plan was to build one million flats by 1975. It was\nimplemented successively, and in the 1970s the number\nof new apartments was growing at a rate of more than\none hundred thousand each year.” In Romania, from\nthe beginning of the 1970s, about one hundred and forty\nthousand apartments were built annually.’ Moreover,\nthese countries tried to keep the costs of rent as low as\npossible. World Bank experts reported with dismay that\non the threshold of transformation, rent in Hungary was\nonly 3 per cent of household income.\n\nSo how did the citizens of the region’s countries,\n\n5 HOW CENTRAL EUROPE LOST ITS RIGHT TO HOUSING, AND HOW TO GET IT BACK",
    "Page_8": "whose decades of active housing policy confirmed the\nbelief that every person deserves a home, so quickly\nbecame convinced that this is a private matter, and\n\nthat everyone should take care of it on their own now?\nUndoubtedly, the ubiquitous discourse promoting indi-\nvidualism and private property played an important role\nduring the transition period. It penetrated all spheres:\nfrom media debates to pop culture images, from daily\npapers to illustrated magazines. Dorota Lesniak-Rychlak\nwrites extensively about the transformation in percep-\ntions and ideas about good life and comfortable living\n\nin her book Jestesmy wreszcie we wtasnym domu (Home\nat last).?° The vision of a prosperous life “at home” was\naccompanied - rather like in the West — by various\nmeasures stigmatizing the system of subsidised social\nhousing and its tenants. Even if the beneficiaries of\nsocial housing and other forms of social support that the\n\nstate provided before 1989 were reluctant to enthusiasti-\ncally embrace the reforms, it was more important for the\nsuccess of the transformation that they found support\namong the elites. They, in turn, willingly adopted and\nreproduced the individualistic discourse.\n\nImportantly, in Central Europe, this discourse was\nnot a complete novelty. The development of housing\nin socialist countries required large financial outlays,\nand the policy of low rents made it difficult to obtain\nadequate funds for the purpose, which is why in the\n1970s some of the region’s countries began to cautiously\nencourage the construction of individual housing. This\nwas not just about introducing the savings thus made by\nthe more affluent households into the economic circula-\ntion. It was the sign that the changes taking place in the\neconomic and social philosophy of socialist states were\nsetting in. In Hungary, the symbol of those changes was\n\n6 WERONIKA PARFIANOWICZ\n\nthe reform of 1968 known as the New Economic Mecha-\nnism, opening up the country to more pro-market forms\nof economic organization. Similar processes took place\nin Czechoslovakia and in Poland. Today, it is particu-\nlarly important to try and capture the moment when the\nsocialist ethos of collective action for a common, better\nfuture began to erode, and became gradually replaced\nby the individualistic discourse of aspiration and mate-\nrial consumption, family values and conservative mod-\nels of social relations. It shows that laying foundations\nfor the introduction of neoliberal solutions in the region\nwas stretched over time. Even before experts from the\nWorld Bank formulated their recommendations for Cen-\ntral Europe, the Polish Round Table thematic group for\nhousing policy called for “a move away from egalitarian-\nism in the field of housing”, and its co-chairman Alek-\nsander Paszkowski demanded that housing be moved",
    "Page_9": "“to the sphere of consumption, to a much greater extent\nthan until now”. He saw a manifestation of “demand-\ning attitude” and “confused thinking” in the belief that\n“everyone is entitled to housing”.\n\nDifferent faces of neoliberalism\nWhile virtually all Central European countries have\ndecided to privatize their housing stock, we will see\nmany differences between them in terms of speed, scale,\nand the way they implemented their reforms. In Lithua-\nnia, 95 per cent of the housing stock had been privatized\nby 1995, while in other countries this process continued\nuntil the late 2000s.” The history of the region shows\nthat neoliberalism, from the start, was never a mono-\nlithic political and economic project. It was influenced\nby local political cultures, as a result of negotiations\nbetween different groups of stakeholders, and it took\nvarious forms. In Poland, the introduction of neoliberal\nreforms was particularly aggressive. The reformers were\neager to employ the “shock therapy” discourse, and\nthey left no room for illusion: wellbeing of the society\nin transition was not their primary concern. In Estonia,\nneo-liberal ideology was integrated as an element of\nnational identity, and the privatization of housing was\npart of the process of symbolic breaking away from the\npast of the former Soviet Republic. The authorities tried\nto symbolically compensate for the inconveniences\nrelated to the course of reforms by strengthening the\nnationalist course.”¢ It was different still in Hungary,\nwhere the society expected the safety net of social secu-\nrity, and the largest political parties responded to this\ndemand by introducing various mechanisms to miti-\ngate the course of transition, including investments in\nthe pension system, family policy, and unemployment\nbenefits.””\n\nFrom today’s perspective, it might seem that these\ndifferences are not of great importance, since all pol-\nicies ultimately produced similar effects. However, it\nis worth recalling the words of Karl Polanyi from The\nGreat Transformation: “the pace of change is often no\nless important than the change itself; and if we cannot\ninfluence the change itself, we can influence the pace at\nwhich it takes place.” It was in influencing the pace of\nchanges that Polanyi saw a key tool for mitigating the\nsocial effects caused by the profound transformation of\neconomic systems. For ordinary people it was a funda-\nmental difference - whether the reforms in the 1990s\nwere accompanied by protective measures, mitigating\nthe effects of changes and improving the quality of\neveryday life, or whether they were offered symbolic\nennoblement as the only form of compensation, leading\nto increased ethnic tensions and antagonizing various\nsocial groups.\n\nHOW CENTRAL EUROPE LOST ITS RIGHT TO HOUSING, AND HOW TO GET IT BACK\n\nInequalities, discrimination, racism\nOne of the categories fetishized by neoliberal discourse\nis economic growth. The example of Central Europe\nproves that this ideology is remarkably effective in gen-\nerating growth in another field. David Harvey noted that\nthe region experienced the greatest growth “in terms of\ninequality” following the introduction of free-market\nreforms.’ Privatization of housing played an impor-\ntant role in this process. Flats sold at a high discount,\nup to 90 per cent of their value, were priced arbitrarily,\nwithout taking into account factors that would affect the\nmarket price. Therefore:\n\nOne can speak of a ‘value gap’, i.e. the differ-\nence between the price paid by tenants for the\nredemption of flats and their rapidly changing\nmarket value. The capitalist logic of the real\nestate market, where location translates into\nmarket value, has strengthened the existing\nsocio-economic divisions, not only inside cities,\nbut also between them. [...] If, for example, two\nteachers, one from Watbrzych and the other\nfrom Warsaw, earning more or less the same\nsalaries at the beginning of the transformation,\nbought identical apartments for the same price\nin the same block of flats in 1991, this would not\nmean that both got the same deal.3°\n\nSocio-economic divisions had their origins among\nother things in the way housing was distributed dur-\ning the socialist era. Although egalitarianism was an\nessential element of the socialist political project,\nvarious practices fossilized old social hierarchies or\nproduced new ones. It was not only about the privileges\nresulting from political commitment and loyalty to the\nauthorities, which sometimes might have been helpful\nfor obtaining a flat in a prestigious neighbourhood,\nbut about a systemic phenomenon observed in various\ncountries of the region. As early as the 1960s, Hungarian\ncity planners and sociologists noted a disturbing mech-\nanism of unequal housing distribution among various\nsocial groups. Their research showed that:\n\nAmong those who were offered newly built\napartments, the share of well-educated,\nwealthier families was disproportionately high.\nThe new housing estates became home to the\nsocialist middle class, while workers and other\npoorer families had to remain in the flats that\nhad been much more modestly subsidized, or\noften they occupied inferior housing in the inner\ncity or on the outskirts, where the infrastructure\nwas significantly inferior.3\"\n\nSimilar results as the ones found in the work of\nHungarian experts, and reported by Csaba Jelinek, were\nobtained in the research of a pioneering team led by\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n28\n\n29\n30\n31\n\nRuczaj Estate in Krakow, from\nthe series Self-affirmation\n\nD.

    "Page_10": "Ewa Kaltenberg-Kwiatkowska, who dealt with the sociol-\nogy of housing in Poland in the 1970s. The researchers\nobserved that access to housing — in addition to educa-\ntion or free time resources — is one of the main factors\ndifferentiating society.** Representatives of the intelli-\ngentsia more often than representatives of working-class\nprofessions lived in higher-standard premises, in new\nbuildings, in better located and better connected parts\nof cities.\n\nOther forms of exclusion overlap with class inequali-\nties. The authors of the Romanian manifesto write:\n\nAmong these categories, there are groups that\nfind themselves at the intersection of several\nconditions of precarity, violence, and margin-\nality. The Roma communities are a group that\nconstantly feels the effects of the housing\n\ncrisis [...], housing injustice works according to\na racist logic, revealing itself through an acute\nand consistent dispossession and dislocation of\nthe Roma persons and communities.\n\nIndeed, housing policy can be one of the most effective\ntools of racial segregation — take for example ‘redlining’\n— the infamous planning practice applied in the United\nStates since the 1930s. Its effects are sorely felt even to\nthis day. Entire social groups are spatially excluded and\ncondemned to living in poorer material and sanitary\nconditions, poorer access to services and public institu-\ntions, and problems with finding employment. When a\nmajor public health crisis strikes —- such as the current\npandemic — people in these areas are most at risk, they\nhave poorer access to medical facilities, and they are\nmore severely affected by the economic meltdown.\nMany Roma communities in Central European\ncountries are struggling with such problems as a result\nof both the systemic, long-term discrimination, and the\nmodern-day economic mechanisms. Despite the fact\nthat after the end of World War II, many initiatives were\nundertaken in the region aimed at the emancipation\nof the Roma people, improving their living conditions,\nand supporting the development of social and cultural\ninstitutions, individual states pursued inconsistent\npolicies and applied practices that were in fact favouring\nsegregation. Csaba Jelinek points out that in Hungary\nsuch an effect was accompanied by the introduction of\nthe New Economic Mechanism: “the previous univer-\nsalist and egalitarian discourse was transformed into\na more exclusive and selective one, focused on quali-\ntative differences between various groups benefiting\nfrom social welfare [...] the main effect of which was the\nstigmatization of the poorer people and Roma families.”\nThe effects of such stigmatization were also noticea-\nble in Czechoslovakia. When a modern industrial centre\nwas built on the ruins of an old mining\ntown of Most, its inhabitants opposed the\n\nsettlement of Roma families in the neighbourhood.\nEventually, the settlement of Chanov, intended for the\nRomani community, was established a few kilometres\naway from the new, comfortable housing estates. Spa-\ntially separated, excluded in terms of transport acces-\nsibility, and with lesser supply of services, it quickly\nbecame a kind of ghetto.34\n\nThe immediate ghettoization of such centres after\nthe political transformation and the collapse of large\nindustrial plants took place in many areas. The living\nconditions of Roma people in the 1990s deteriorated —\nbe it in Chanov, or the Lunik settlement near KoSice,\nor the Hungarian tower block estates in Miskolc, while\nlatest research shows that the housing situation of this\nethnic group is improving slowly. Roma people live\nin significantly worse conditions than the majority\nsocieties: in more overcrowded, substandard housing,\nlacking basic amenities — often without running water or\nadequate sanitary infrastructure.%5\n\nFree-market housing policy exacerbates these prob-\nlems and generates new ones, which can be illustrated\nwith the example of the Czech Republic, a country with\na limited supply of municipal housing. Housing benefits\nare the main form of support for families in a difficult\nfinancial situation, and although the subsidy is small,\nit is permanent and reliable. No wonder that entrepre-\nneurs soon appeared on the housing market, having\nnoticed a source of guaranteed profit in the recipients\nof the benefits. Private companies began to buy former\nworkers’ hostels and apartments in multi-family blocks\n\nWERONIKA PARAFIANOWICZ\n\n \n\nof flats and rent them out to people who receive housing\nallowances. The regulations do not define the condi-\ntions to be met by social housing. As a result, numerous\nRomani families, who cannot find apartments for rent\nin the commercial market —- among other things, due\nto prejudice on the part of the majority society** — are\nforced to live in substandard, overcrowded, run-down\nworkers’ hostels or dilapidated blocks of flats. Short-\nterm lease contracts and the terrible condition of the\nbuildings (which can be taken out of service at any time)\nforce Roma families to move frequently. Another feature\nof the neoliberal economic model emerges: there is no\ngroup too poor or too vulnerable to become a source\nof additional profit. The uncontrolled market not only\nfails to provide decent housing conditions for those less\nwell-to-do, but it also very effectively seizes public funds\nintended to help them.*”\n\nThe ‘trade in poverty’ in Czech cities is not acciden-\ntal, neither is it a Central European aberration. Trade\nin substandard units rented to recipients of housing\nbenefits, on par with toxic financial services (such as\nhigh-interest payday loans), is one of the most wide-\nspread practices of the dynamically developing ‘poverty\nindustry.’ Its activities have a negative impact on the\nhousing situation not only in Central Europe, but also,\nfor example, in the United States. In the US, much like in\nthe Czech Republic, it is the representatives of minority\ngroups that feel its effects most acutely.\n\nThe ‘trade in poverty’ also leads to spatial isola-\ntion of people in a difficult financial situation, to the",
    "Page_11": "deterioration of buildings and entire housing estates,\nand, as a result, to further tensions and conflicts. The\nhousing crisis is hitting the Roma community in two\nways: firstly, it exposes them to living in precarious\nconditions; secondly, it leads to the deepening of xeno-\nphobic sentiments in the majority society and the inten-\nsification of racist incidents. You can clearly feel that the\natmosphere in Most is hostile towards Romani people.\nThree years ago, Czech public opinion was shocked by\nthe campaign ahead of the local elections, in which local\npolitical groups openly used racist, anti-Roma rhetoric.\nThe majority of the inhabitants of Most and its vicin-\n\nity are plagued by the progressive neglect of housing\nestates and the debt of housing communities, partly\n\nas a result of speculation on the housing market. Their\nanger, however, is turned not towards the corrupt man-\nagement of the local housing cooperative which looks\nafter a large part of the housing stock in the region, but\ntowards the tenants on benefits — and most of those are\nRoma people. Instead of fighting the unfair practices by\nprivate companies, the residents of Most are demanding\nthe creation of areas where families on benefits will not\nbe able to move in, and thus, effectively, another form of\nspatial segregation.**\n\nNeoliberal housing policy preys on the social divi-\nsions already existing in our communities; worse, it\ndeepens those divides: the anger of those affected by its\nnegative effects is channelled not against the source of\nit, but against even weaker and more excluded groups.\nThe discriminatory mechanisms are escalating.\n\nHow to fight the pandemic\n\nof capitalism and racism?\nThe issues described above explain why the manifesto of\nthe Romanian collective mentioned in the introduction\nbears the significant subheading fmpotriva pandemiei\ncapitalismului si rasismului (Combating the pandemic of\ncapitalism and racism). How to fight this pandemic? The\nauthors offer a clear-cut prescription:\n\nThe time has come for the rich to pay for\neverything that they stole through workforce\nexploitation, real estate speculation, and the\ntheft of the government's resources [...]. We\nneed radical measures to make sure that\n\nthe economic post-crisis order will be one of\nequality and social justice. The time has come\nfor those privileged by the system all over the\nworld, who have accumulated profit and enor-\nmous wealth over the last decades, to pay their\ndues. [...] It is time to end the regime where the\nreal estate developers, the great renting compa-\nnies, and private utility providers make enor-\nmous profit off the backs of those who barely\nsurvive from one month to the next!\n\nThe postulate may sound radical, but we should\nstart getting used to this type of radicalism. In the\ncontext of the multidimensional crisis we face today,\nit is not enough to debunk the naturalized “common\nsense” elements of neoliberal ideology. It is necessary\nto disseminate values and attitudes that may have an\nimpact on changing the socio-economic and political\nparadigm. Perhaps it is worth finally to consider aban-\ndoning capitalism as a reasonable and well-founded\npostulate? The examples I have cited from the history of\nCentral European countries show that socialist systems,\nin which housing was treated as a basic need rather than\na commodity, were much better at securing it. However,\nthey also show that economic mechanisms (for example,\na planned increase in housing construction spending)\nand only declarative egalitarianism, albeit not accompa-\nnied by a constant evaluation of anti-inequality policies,\nis not enough, especially in societies burdened with\nsocial stratification and long traditions of national or\nethnic discrimination.\n\nIf we come back to seeing housing as a way to meet\nthe basic human needs, we will also be more effective in\ndealing with the environmental burdens generated by\nthe construction sector. During the deepening climate\nand ecological crisis, it is extremely important to pro-\nvide all people with decent housing conditions without\nundue pressure on the environment. Let us finally begin\nto learn from the experience of housing policies, and\nthen let us use it in a solidarity-based fight for a world\nwith better living conditions — and a better life - for\neveryone. e\n\n€\nRuczaj Estate in Krakow, from\nthe series Self-affirmation\n\n32 E.

It was this\nthought that broke him the most, and which\ncaused him to weep as Elochukwu, who would\nbe handing over the keys of the house to the\nnew owners, locked it all up.\"\n\nThe dwelling — house or apartment - although undoubt-\nedly separated from the surrounding space by a solid\nstructure of walls and ceilings, goes beyond the origi-\nnal framework of physical shelter and fulfils a funda-\nmental function in human life. As sociologist and city\nactivist Joanna Erbel argues, our dwelling determines\nour initial situation, as it determines opportunities, or\nbecomes a source of limitations.” The way in which we\nmanage to meet our housing needs determines other\nlife strategies — it influences our decisions about taking\nup a job, starting a family, or pursuing education. It\nregulates the rhythm of everyday life, based on a spe-\ncific routine of necessary habits and behaviours. It can\nbecome an eloquent element of self-creation or, on the\ncontrary, an allegorical cage from which we strive to\nescape — a lesson that many of us learned the hard way\nduring the pandemic. All the while, the material shell of\nthe apartment is covered with a dense web of personal\nmeanings and associations assigned thereto, memories\nof moments spent with loved ones, emotions we expe-\nrienced. Despite the multidimensionality of the issue,\nPoles have become accustomed to considering it in\nterms imposed by the neoliberal dogma, which reduces\nhousing to economic parameters, dictated not so much\nby the actual costs of shaping the housing environment,\nbut by the imperative of profit. As a result, the selling\nprice per square meter has become the most sacred indi-\ncator describing the home.\n\nThe fundamental metamorphosis of the Polish hous-\ning system has, of course, a transformational pedigree\nand is an expression of not only political and economic\nchanges, but above all, of social changes. The modernity\nthat was crystallizing in the 1990s in the West, which\nthe Third Polish Republic was hastily trying to catch\nup with, was described by Zygmunt Bauman as liquid\nmodernity. According to Bauman, the latter replaced\nthe historic stage of early, “solid” capitalism, directly\nderived from the industrial revolution. Its symbols\nfeatured Fordist factory, bureaucracy, Panopticon, Big\nBrother, and finally, the Konzlager.’ This epoch was\nhaunted by the dangerous spectre of totalitarianism,\nsummarized in Orwell’s canonical 1984, and in Polish lit-\n\nerature, for instance in Witkacy’s Sze-\n\nwcy [The Shoemakers] or Pozegnanie\n\nEMPTY AGORA\n\nJesieni [Farewell to Autumn]. Predominant fear con-\ncerned the defencelessness of an individual, melting\ninto the homogeneous mass of society and losing auton-\nomy in confrontation with a centralized political system.\nThe emancipation of man from the reality filled with\nthreats became a historic turning point; it opened the\nway to a new order, which to a greater or lesser extent\nbegan to be guided by Margaret Thatcher’s infamous\nmaxim “There’s no such thing as society.” In the ethical\nand political discourse, utopian visions of a just soci-\nety began to be displaced by new goals focused on the\nindividual and his never-ending identity project. The\nmodern condition of “continuous transgression” turned\nout not only to be devoid of faith in gaining control of\nthe future - and thus a goal that would be worth striving\nfor — but also lacking the support of a community of\npeople heading in a similar direction. The fragmentary\nnature of the world and the indeterminacy of the indi-\nvidual resulted in anxiety, as well as loneliness in facing\nlife challenges. Furthermore, Bauman concludes, indi-\nvidualization is not a choice but a human fate, and the\nindependence or self-sufficiency of the individual is yet\nanother illusion.4 Thus, freedom has a bitter aftertaste\nof appearances, because we did not choose the circum-\nstances in which we are faced with our choices, and we\nprobably have no influence upon those either.\n\nWhat is truly disastrous for a good housing system,\nthough, is not so much the existential dilemmas of\nindividuals as the accompanying breakdown of the\nidea of community. The individual is the citizen’s worst\nenemy because the citizen “is a person inclined to\nseek his or her own welfare through the well-being of\nthe city — while the individual tends to be lukewarm,\nsceptical or wary about ‘common cause’.”> Bauman’s\nconcerns are shared by the American philosopher and\nhistorian of ideas, Mark Lilla. The latter criticizes con-\ntemporary liberal politics for giving up inspiring people\nto actively transform society in favour of the passive,\nsocial construction of individuals: “In an age when we\nneed to educate young people to think of themselves as\ncitizens with duties toward each other, we encourage\nthem instead to descend into the rabbit hole of the self.”¢\nThe individual pulled into an identity project, out of\nmomentum ends up occupying a position in the culture\nwar in which “what is being said is much less important\nthan who wants to speak and for what reason”.” Michat\nMarkowski, literary critic and essayist, explains that the\ndirect consequence of “aggression of opinions, emo-\ntions, and values” is progressing polarization, because\nthe dividing line today runs in a horizontal, level rela-\ntionship, between contradictory world views of voters,\nrather than vertically, bottom-up, that is, between soci-\nety and those in power.’\n\nWhen postmodernity reached Poland, a backward\ncountry in relation to the West, it fell on fertile ground\n\n \n\nin a society tired of the People’s Republic and resulted\nin a wide-ranging “manifestation of long-suppressed\nindividuality”.? In this article, I will try to summarize the\nlegacy of the transformational restructuring of Polish\nhousing, classify its most important trends, and also\nshow that housing and the debate about it as a particu-\nlar, indispensable good may spark broader, positive\nchanges, addressing further social stratification.\n\nPrivatization of profits,\nsocialization of losses\nAt the root of contemporary living trends lies the trans-\nformational reshuffling of roles and values. Satisfying\nhousing needs is now the responsibility of a modern\n— and therefore self-sufficient and independent - indi-\nvidual, rather than of the social policy by the State, as\nthe latter gladly relinquishes control tools in this area.\nInseparable from this phenomenon is the final enno-\nblement of private property, equated with security, and\nseen as a symbol of individual resourcefulness.\n\n1.

As a result, in 2011, private housing made\nup nearly 80 per cent of the total stock. Just over 10 per\ncent was under public control, and only a few per cent\nremained within the social housing sector.\n\nThe inevitable consequence of seeing the purchase\nof a home as the only correct strategy is the generation\nburdened with twenty or thirty years of mortgage loans.\nIts representatives often equate signing a loan agree-\nment with true maturity. “For all those who are grown\nup enough to have their own apartment, PKO Bank Pol-\nski offers a mortgage loan at an interest of 1.1 per cent for\nthe first year” - announced the PKO Bank advertisement\nin 2011.4 Meanwhile, although in the contemporary\nglobal economic order credit is undoubtedly an impor-\ntant tool enabling the achievement of housing and other\ngoals, it is often associated with a significant restriction\nof freedom in making life decisions. It may even become\ntantamount with being trapped in a specific personal\nor professional situation, stable but not satisfactory\n\nyt\n\n \n\nenough. The discipline imposed by the bank loan is also\ncontroversial in a broader, social dimension. According\nto the anthropologist Kacper Pobtocki, “it is a blurry line\nbetween loaning in order to increase the availability of\nhousing and make life easier for millions of people, and\nthe moment when the debt mechanism becomes an\ninstrument of exercising power.”\n\nThe basic problem in the Polish housing system\nis not the bank loan in itself, but its unquestionable\ninevitability - due to the lack of other options, such as\ninstitutional rental, lease with pursuit of ownership, or\naffordable housing — and its long-term nature, caused\non the one hand by insufficient purchasing power of\nPolish wages on the housing market, and on the other\nhand, the dominance of this market by private entities\ndriven by return on their investment. All the choice that\nthe free, autonomous and self-sufficient individuals are\n\nleft with is to choose their relationship with the neces-\nsity of debt: either he or she will believe in credit, or feel\ncondemned to it. In addition, this dubious luxury can\nonly befall the richest Poles, about 20 per cent of the\npopulation, most of who will not buy a flat for cash, but\nwill “accomplish” creditworthiness.’° Bank loan also\nbecomes an obvious choice due to the deregulated and\ncompletely unprofitable rental market. If it is within\nyour reach, it is better to pay your instalment than\nsomeone else’s, especially since the character of the\nlease agreement is not that of a partnership, and your\nfreedom and comfort of living - from the decor to long-\nterm security - depend on the owner’s whim. Adding to\nthat the typically poor condition of the offered apart-\nments, it is no wonder that only 4.5 per cent of Poles\ndecide to rent their flat on the open market.”\n\nPeople falling into the so-called rent gap are even\nworse-off: they earn too little to achieve creditworthi-\nness, but too much to be able to apply for social housing\nor other form of support from the State or local govern-\nment. According to estimates, the problem affects 30-40\nper cent of the population.'* Also worrying is the high\npercentage of young Poles between the ages of 25 and\n34 who still live with their parents. Eurostat data shows\nthat this concerns as many as 40.5 per cent of this age\ngroup.” In the neoliberal model, the risks, contradic-\ntions and obstacles are still a product of society, and yet\nthe responsibility and necessity to deal with them are\ntransferred to the shoulders of individuals.”° As soci-\nologist Mateusz Halawa explains, as a result, “housing\nclasses” developed, replacing traditional social classes,”\nand belonging to those is associated with the way in\nwhich we deal with satisfying our housing needs and,\nas a result, the way we live.\n\nDorota Lesniak-Rychlak mentions spatial implica-\ntions of new forms of living in her book Jestesmy wresz-\ncie we wtasnym domu [In our own home, at last]. These\ninclude: a gentrified tenement house, a modernized\nblock of flats, a suite in a gated community, a house in\nthe suburbs, and a suburban residence.” The sociologist\nJoanna Kusiak explains that their unrestrained prolifer-\nation in the city and beyond - the mythical visual\nchaos — is not a phenomenon of unknown origin, but\na manifestation of the installation of neoliberal order,\nan expression of the logic of capital’s operation in\nspace.”’ The key factor in this process is the freedom\nwith which these paradigms can be implemented,\nresulting from the practical abolition of the role of\nan urban planner; from gaps in the local master plan;\nfrom lack of not only the will, but also of strategies and\ntools that would enable local governments to supervise\nthe partnership with the private party, while securing\nthe public interests they represent.

This reprehensible arrangement\nhas become part of the canon of common expectations\n— since we live far away from the city centre, it seems\nnatural that everywhere and everything is remote. In\nthe dream of a suburban cottage, “time is reduced to\none moment, which is a Saturday afternoon spent with\nyoung children in the garden, playing with the dog or\nhaving a barbecue together”; in this idyll, “the chil-\ndren will never grow up, and the weekend will not turn\ninto a tedious working day marked by arduous com-\nmute,” notes Joanna Erbel.”4 Say what you will about\nthe post-transformation aspirations of Polish people,\nadditionally stimulated by television clichés; with rising\nhousing prices in the city centre, expanding one’s living\nspace turns out to be economically feasible only in the\nmuch cheaper suburbs. This form of living - and with it,\ndevelopers and banks - was also supported by the State\nin its few interventions — for example, as part of the\nMieszkanie dla Mtodych [Flat for the Young] program,\n\nit offered loan subsidies, but only up to a specific, low\nprice per square meter.\n\nDorota Lesniak-Rychlak explains that the move of\nmore enterprising or better-off social groups to new\nliving spaces — whether a house in a green suburbia or\na gated estate within the city - has become a way of\nactualising “the conviction of middle-class represent-\natives about achieving success and wealth through\ntheir own talents and work”. Since, according to the\nconcept of a resourceful individual, private property in\nthe housing sector both motivates and attests success,\ndevelopers quickly understood that separating new\nestates from the urban fabric would increase their value.\nIn Poland, statistically, there are significantly fewer rob-\nberies and thefts than in many other countries within\nthe European Community.”° The obsessive construction\nof wire mesh fences — which by the way are easy to climb\nover — is on the one hand a marketing trick based on\nthe commodification of fear, and on the other hand, an\nexpression of the nouveau riche prestige associated with\nthe place where such “problems” as “people walking\nby the windows”, “bums loitering”, or “drunk students\nreturning home at night” have been eliminated.”” We\nare slowly bidding farewell to fences thanks to the new\nlandscape laws, written in the belief that the city should\nbe acommon platform, a place to live and meet various\nsocial groups, with a structure allowing for free move-\nment of people.\n\nThe fence is the tip of the iceberg of problems\nstemming from closed housing environments with\ngentrifying potential. Already at the marketing level,\nprivate investors strictly define their target, and by\ndoing so, they do not eliminate social differences, but\nsimply manage them effectively. An advertisement on\nthe website of one of Warsaw’s property development\ncompanies claims that the new housing estate is being\nbuilt “for people who are open minded, who value inde-\npendence and want to taste new things.” Such messages\nare part of the contemporary tendency to define one’s\nidentity through “disproportionate and mutual aliena-\ntion of one’s own uniqueness versus everyone else’s.”*8\nThe ubiquitous alienation is aggravated by the insuffi-\ncient quantity and quality of common spaces, places of\naccidental contact, and even children’s playgrounds.\n\nHowever, this is not about creating an illusion of\nbeing-together, but rather about “redesigning and\nrepopulating the now largely vacant agora - the site of\nmeeting, debate and negotiation between the individual\nand the common, the private and public good.””° Forty\nyears before Bauman, Hannah Arendt brought this dis-\ncussion to a deeper level by describing the constitutive\naspects of vita activa:\n\nAction and speech create a space between the\nparticipants which can find its proper location",
    "Page_16": "almost any time and anywhere. It is the space\nof appearance in the widest sense of the word\n[...] where | appear to others as others appear\nto me [...]. No man, moreover, can live in it all\nthe time. To be deprived of it means to be\ndeprived of reality [...]. To men the reality of the\nworld is guaranteed by the presence of others,\nby its appearing to all [...] and whatever lacks\nthis appearance comes and passes away like\na dream, intimately and exclusively our own but\nwithout reality.2°\n\nNeither Bauman, in invoking the agora, nor Arendt,\nwhen writing about the space of appearance, meant\nphysical space. Architects often forget that communities\ndo not appear just because we have provided them with\nadequate spatial conditions; after all, their existence\ndoes not depend solely on space. This does not mean\nthat designing common, public spaces is futile. They\nare just one of the components needed. Of course, in the\nend, the agora is a physical structure — a plaza.\n\nNonetheless, a debate and action should develop\nover the issue of space, and living space in particular,\nwhich is equally relevant to us all. Understanding the\nspecificity of the good that is indispensable to everyone,\nsuch as a dwelling, would set a new, supra-individual\ngoal: the right to housing. This essentially solidarity-\nbased proposition is rooted in the belief that ensuring\ndecent living conditions for all members of society is not\nonly at the heart of balancing equal opportunities, but\nwill prove beneficial for the further development of the\ncommunity, including its economic aspect.\n\nIn Article 25 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights,\n\nhousing is made part of the “health and well-being”\nstandard of living to which every person is entitled.*!\nAccording to this assumption, a responsible housing\npolicy must focus on the availability of housing as\n\none of its goals, in addition to the number and qual-\n\nity. Although neither adequate quality, nor even the\nnumber, can be ensured solely by market forces, it is\nprecisely the accessibility - especially understood as\naffordability, ie. cost below 40 per cent of a household’s\nincome* — that simply cannot be realized in a free mar-\nket reality on its own accord. The European Parliament,\nina resolution adopted at the beginning of 2021, also\ncalls on the Member States to ensure universal access to\ndecent housing.*\n\nAccording to the division proposed by the architect\nand researcher Agata Twardoch in her book System do\nmieszkania [Housing system], the shaping of accessible\nhousing, apart from intangibles, is influenced by organ-\nizational factors — top-down and bottom-up - as well\nas spatial factors related to the architectural form and\nlocation. Top-down, systemic organizational measures\nresulting from the policy of the State or local govern-\nment include, for example, elements of fiscal policy (tax\nbreaks), supply policy (council housing and social hous-\ning), demand policy (housing loan subsidies or prefer-\nential loans), and rent control. Bottom-up instruments\nare related to the potential of self-organization of groups\nof people; these include small housing associations,\nconstruction groups, and cohousing. In spatial terms,\nthis is about specific architectural solutions, including\nstructural ones, as well as location aspects related to the\ninteractions between the dwelling and its surroundings.*4\n\nA good housing system, oriented towards increasing\n\n \n\nKINGA ZEMEA\n\naccessibility, would be based on the flexible use of vari-\nous methods and tools, within a coherent plan covering\nall levels of administrative organization — at the State,\nregional, and municipal level. However, I would like to\nfocus on describing two selected strategies: grassroots\ncooperatives, and prefabricated housing systems (the\nlatter concern spatial activities, as I believe them to\nhave the potential to change the individual perspective\ninto the community optics, shaping civic attitudes, and\nsetting bold social goals).\n\nSecond birth\n\nThe history of the cooperatives in Poland started prom-\nisingly in interwar Warsaw, with the establishment of\nthe Warsaw Housing Cooperative and the Society of\nWorkers’ Housing Estates. Alas, these first attempts to\nensure a fair housing environment were interrupted by\nWorld War II, and the ideals of the movement’s pioneers,\npicked up by the communist authorities of the People’s\nRepublic of Poland, were completely distorted in the\nnew political order from the moment the decision was\nmade to manage them centrally. This is the reason why\ntoday they do not evoke positive connotations, and\nmodern forms of cooperatives or cohousing are treated\nas curiosities with no potential for wider dissemination.\nIt is not difficult to imagine a defeatist argument based\non the belief that no one will want them in Poland, or\nthat developer housing estates are convenient and,\nabove all, ready-made solutions, and that Poles are busy\npeople who do not have time for this.\n\nMy belief is that it is the lack of awareness of the\nbenefits of such solutions that is working against the\ncreation of small, grassroots housing cooperatives. The\nblame for this state of affairs lies with the promotion\nof the one and only “correct” model. The convincing\nnarrative of loans and apartments in a commercial\ndevelopment largely draws its strength from the lack\nof alternatives. Meanwhile, a cooperative initiative has\nthe potential of being much cheaper, and therefore\nattractive, especially to those who fall within the rent\ngap. You will still have to take out a loan to cover the\ninvestment contribution and its subsequent costs, but\nit will be a much lower one, because the payment of the\ndeveloper’s profit and overheads that includes sales\noffices, agents and marketing will not be added to the\ncost of building the apartment. The difference becomes\nsignificant when you take into account high developer\nmargins, which have remained at the level of 20-30 per\ncent for several years.* If local governments were to\nrecognize bottom-up housing initiatives as something\npositive, they could support cooperatives, for example\nby selling plots at preferential prices, which would con-\ntribute to further cost reduction.* Building with their\nown housing environment in mind, the cooperatives\nwould be able to define and meet their expectations",

Lilla, too, finds\n\na panacea in the supra-individual attitude, but he also\npoints out that citizens are made, not born.*° There-\nfore, cooperatives have a great activating potential, and\nunlike cohousing, they are generally free from ideo-\nlogical dogmas. Thus collective methods of satisfying\nhousing needs with the support of public agencies may\nyet become an important part of civic practice.\n\nHope glued crosswise\nTwelve million Poles are still living in the modernist\nblocks of the communist era. Despite their unexpectedly\ndurable structure,*! the claustrophobic space, under-\ninsulated and insufficiently soundproofed interiors, and\nthe aesthetics associated with the communist regime\nhave managed to discredit large panel systems, and with\nit the idea of increasing housing resources on a mass\nscale thanks to a system of cheaper and faster produc-\ntion of typical designs. The abstract image of the large\npanel system floating in the air sparked the hope for\na better, equitable future in many places in the world,\nalso outside the Soviet dominion, for example in France,\nthe Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Can-\nada, the United States, Japan, Denmark, Switzerland,\nand Sweden. Associated with the University of Chile in\nSantiago and the London-based Architectural Associ-\nation, architect Pedro Alonso undertook research into\nprefabricated panel structures. He tried to place them\nin the critical architectural discourse. He emphasizes\nthat the large panel system, “timeless, with the expres-\nsion reduced to a minimum’, by challenging the status\nquo, has become to architecture what Malevich’s Black\nSquare is to painting.”\n\nHopes related to prefabrication of apartments\ndid not have to turn out to be naive dreams. Take for\nexample the counterparts of Khrushchyovkas on the\nother side of the Iron Curtain, the Swedish systems. It\nwas in Sweden in 1967 that the largest association of\nhousing co-operatives, HSB, issued En social lyftkran\n[The Social Crane] - a publication, which expressed the\nbelief that the large panel system and the crane that\nassembled it would support the construction of a new\nsocial order. Factory production was expected to help\nkeep the promise made by the social democratic gov-\nernment - to build one million apartments within one\ndecade. Record-breaking for Swedish housing indus-\ntry, Miljonprogrammet [the Million Program] gave an\n\nimpetus to the development of prefabricated systems,\nwhich similarly as for those built in the more tradi-\ntional way was based on the knowledge gained through\nin-depth architectural research conducted since the\n1940s. Detailed analyses of the needs of future residents,\nincluding all the scales of everyday routine - from the\nideal dimensions of living rooms, kitchens, bedrooms\nand bathrooms, down to the standards for wardrobes,\nlockers and cupboards, and even drawers with cutlery\ncompartments - were found in the God Bostad [Good\nApartment] handbook, published in 1954. Erik Stenberg\nof the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, an\narchitect and researcher of the “record years”,“8 explains\nthat these design guidelines — in the modernist spirit\nof seeking the measurability of life and corresponding\nstandards - contributed greatly to subsequent success of\nIKEA. Swedish prefabricated apartments were spacious,\ncomfortable, and well-lit, and at the same time they\nwere designed in a modernist style, whose logic is still\nappreciated by their tenants today.*4 From the contem-\nporary perspective, the most remarkable feature is the\nfully prefabricated S-66 system by Ohlsson & Skarne\n(later purchased by Skanska), consisting of load-bearing\nwalls, ceiling panels and columns. In this arrangement,\nthe load-bearing walls do not cut across the flats, so the\narrangement and layout of the latter depends on the\nneeds of the users. The orthogonal discipline of this\nsystem imposes limitations on moulding the exter-\nnal architectural body, but it offers high flexibility of\nshaping the interior — it is possible not only to create\nindependent units, but also to connect apartments\nrelatively freely, which was achieved, for example, in the\ndesign by the aforementioned Erik Stenberg for a fam-\nily of ten. The S-66 has been tested and proven both in\nsix-storey blocks in the Stockholm district of Tensta, and\nin the intimate Orminge development outside the city,\nwhere the height of the buildings does not exceed three\nstoreys.\n\nIn this short historical summary, the most important\nthreads of the abandoned system design are becom-\ning clear. It is primarily about increasing the supply of\naffordable housing, thanks to typical modules and fac-\ntory production. It is also crucial to support the indus-\ntrial process with exhaustive research on housing needs\npresent and future, including understanding of the\nlocal context, for example, demographic forecasts or the\ndevelopment prospects of smaller and medium-sized\ncities, but also more universal premises, including free\nspatial arrangements that will easily yield to functional\nre-adaptation. Market research conducted by developers\n— contrary to theories about the invisible hand that will\nsolve the problems and fill the gaps — basically equates\nthe financial possibilities of Poles with their aspirations.\nAs a result, especially in the centres of larger cities, a lot\nof small flats are being built, which investors vaguely",
    "Page_20": "explain by the advent of a new generation of people\nwho “live out on the town and do not need large living\nspaces.”45 Arguably, they fail to notice the continuing\ntrend of families looking for their own home in the more\naffordable suburbs.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of modern construc-\ntion is minimizing the negative impact on climate\nchange. Large panel systems as comprehensive, intelli-\ngently designed templates, ready for highly controlled\nfactory production. They can be seen as an attempt\nto reconcile the interests of society and the welfare of\nthe planet, subject to verification of material solutions.\nThus, rigid panels made of timber glued crosswise, used\nincreasingly often in the construction of apartment\nblocks, for example in Scandinavia, will work best.\n\nMoreover, the architecture assembled from the\nnew and more environmentally friendly large panel is\naesthetically neutral due to the fact that the supporting\ncore of the panel, made of several layers of glued wood,\nmust be protected by some type of external facade.\n\nThe repetitive logic of the prefabricated system does\n\nnot allow for an showy MVRDV-style treatment of the\nbuilding’s body, but it can be softened by well chosen\nmaterials, thoughtful details, the atmosphere of the\nplace shaped by the scale of the objects and their mutual\nrelations, as well as consciously conducted spatial\n\n18 KINGA ZEMEA\n\nsequences, full of tensions — intriguing passages, cut-\nouts, animated ground floors — but also intimate nooks,\nopen courtyards, and so forth. Despite the industri-\nalization of the construction process, there is a lot of\nroom for creativity of architects and town planners,\n\nand they should make an effort to break the negative\nvisual associations that the large panel system evokes\namong the public. Curiously, the widespread aversion to\n“monotone aesthetics” does not include the consistently\nboring housing estates, dull as dishwater, in every shade\nof beige.\n\nFor many years, representatives of the Polish\narchitectural community have attempted to break the\nspell and rehabilitate prefabrication as an effective\nconstruction solution, referring to its frequent use in\nScandinavian countries. Only recently has there been\na progressive interest in residential systems based on\ntypical projects and large-panel elements. The subject\nis more frequently taken up by the authors of diploma\ntheses and organizers of competitions, including those\ncarried out at the initiative of the state-owned company\nPFR Nieruchomosci, responsible for the implementa-\ntion of part of the National Housing Program.\n\nOn the theoretical level, the main housing objectives\nare slowly shifting, embracing the government’s policy,\nat least on paper. System design could turn out to be\n\nan important tool facilitating the implementation of\nthe egalitarian postulate, according to which belonging\nto acommunity is a sufficient reason to ensure decent\nliving conditions and more equitable development\nopportunities — for the benefit of the whole society.\n\nFilling the agora\n“By social housing I mean any housing that does not\nmake a direct profit, that is, the construction of houses\nwith their inhabitants in mind, rather than the rent they\nare going to pay,” wrote the famous cooperative activist\nTeodor Teoplitz in 1929.4¢ Nearly a hundred years later,\nthis simple postulate placing the good of the community\nbefore the profit of individuals sounds almost utopian —\nnot only because of the priorities of the new system, but\nalso because the myth of an independent individual has\narisen and consolidated in the public consciousness, and\nat least a portion of society firmly believe it to be true.\n\n“The experience of people who took out a loan to\nbuy an apartment, especially those on the verge of\ncreditworthiness, is a constant effort and work on ‘mak-\ning sense of the debt’.”4” The generation that tried to\nsatisfy their and their loved ones’ housing needs in the\npost-transformation reality created a specific ethos of\na grand life project; within it, the rightfulness of the cho-\nsen - or rather the only available - path of sacrifices and\nhard work was sealed by the success of owning a condo.\nIn the context of facilitating or normalizing the housing\nissue for the next generations, it is not difficult to under-\nstand the sense of historical injustice, but one should\nbeware indulging the often naive belief that accompa-\nnies it - namely, belief in a “just world” in which people\nworse off than ourselves clearly did not deserve a better\nfate, because they were too lazy, too clumsy, or maybe\neven degenerate.\n\nI grew up and lived most of my life in a typical block\nof flats from the 1970s, so Iam particularly disgusted\nby the conviction that the reward for “resourcefulness”\n— that is, a better start, resulting from greater cultural\ncapital, good upbringing, a favourable environment or\nsimply happiness, plus actually putting in the effort\n- should be a flat “without riffraff next door”. Joanna\nErbel, already as the director of the Innovation Office\nof PFR Nieruchomosci, mentions in her book how she\nheard from neighbours in the newly built housing estate\n\n46 T.

In the system of unbalanced, and even\nheightened material, social, and cultural differences,\nthe concept of being the architect of one’s own fortune is\nnot only a useless strategy, but a dangerous illusion that\nmounts even more barriers between members of the\ncommunity.\n\nThe fiasco of the neoliberal belief in the invisible\nhand that will put our world in order should not come\nas a surprise. The free market that serves the interests\nof individuals focuses on that which pays, and these are\nluxury apartments in prestigious locations, not afforda-\nble housing. Criticizing property developers for being\nproperty developers is futile and it leads us nowhere, as\nthe subject of criticism should be the political strat-\negy, which resigns itself to their mercy: “housing issue\nshould depend on State regulations, rather than individ-\nual choices.”49\n\nThe solutions I have mentioned, used together\nwith other methods aimed at increasing the offer and\navailability of housing, could become the foundation\nof a more fair social order.

The complex sphere of housing always\nconsists of an intricate tangle of social issues. If we were\nto consider this concept in its full Heideggerian sense,\nwe would end up delving deep into the sensitive issues\nof home, fatherland, individual and collective iden-\ntity. Here, too, we would not manage without the word\n\n“crisis”. Instead, we will start with a simple quantitative\naccount: over the last century, the Czech Republic has\nnot recorded a single year in which there would be\nsufficient housing for everyone, but in its turbulent\nhistory, the lack of housing has more than once turned\ninto a housing crisis. Its cause has not changed since the\nturbulent urbanization of the nineteenth century: the\nnumber of inhabitants for whom housing is financially\ndifficult to access is growing the fastest, whereas the\nnumber of dwellings available for them is growing the\nslowest.\n\nAccording to the last census, by January 1, 2011, there\nwere a total of 4.76 million flats in the Czech Republic.\nThis means 465.5 flats per 1,000 inhabitants - slightly\nless than the EU average (489.4).* After all, statistical\ndata can be deceptive. For example, in Spain, there\nare 549.7 dwellings per 1,000 inhabitants, the highest\nnumber in Europe, but this indicator is not related to\nthe overall well-being; after the investment bubble\nbroke, Spain also has the highest vacancy rate. In the\nCzech Republic, 83.4 per cent of the available housing\nunits are occupied. In absolute terms, this means that\n652,000 apartments are empty.$ We do not know exactly\nwhat proportion of those is accounted for by landlord\nspeculation on the rising real estate prices, but it is\ncertainly the majority.\n\nThe average age of the inhabited dwellings is fifty\nyears. Thus, a typical Czech apartment remembers\nsocialism, the Soviet occupation, the fall of the com-\nmunist dictatorship, and the collapse of the common\nstate of Czechs and Slovaks. Many flats, of course, have\nsurvived both world wars - indeed, some of them go\nback as far as the Napoleonic wars. However, statistics\nare more interested in newer apartments. In 2019, 36,419\napartments were put into service throughout the Czech\nRepublic and the construction of another 38,677 started,\nmost of them in Prague (6,487) and Central Bohemia\n(6,489).6\n\nMoving to the apartment block\nThe pace of new construction can be measured by\nthe rhythm of housing crises. We will never settle this\n\n21 FROM TOWER BLOCKS TO TOWER BLOCKS\n\nmatter once and for all. The housing stock is physically\nused up; new needs and opportunities arise. It has never\nbeen possible to reduce the difference between the\nnumber of flats needed and those built. Only the width\nof the gap, and the means expected to solve the prob-\nlems have changed.\n\nAfter World War I, the young Czechoslovak Republic\ntried to make up for the inherited shortage of housing.\nAt the level of municipalities and cooperatives, condi-\ntions were created conducive to the construction of new\napartments, while limiting speculation at the same time.\nThen came the economic crisis and not all plans were\nrealized. Immediately after World War IL the housing\nsituation did not seem too dramatic. Compared to\nPoland or Germany, the losses that we suffered on the\nhousing market because of the war were minor. What\nis more, as a result of post-war displacement, former\nGerman flats and houses became vacant. There were\nso many of them that not all were utilised during the\nre-populating of border areas. In the five years from 1946\nto 1950, the average annual increase was only 1.39 new\ndwelling per 1,000 inhabitants. The focus was on repair-\ning the economy. The recovery in housing construction\nbegan only with the advent of socialist industrialization.\nApart from the state, the role of housing cooperatives\nhas gained importance again. The culmination took\nplace in the 1970s - when the annual average growth\nexceeded 8 new apartments per 1,000 inhabitants.\nUnfortunately, the economy could not cope with such\ndynamics; stagnation set in, and by the end of the 1980s\nthe growth rate had dropped by almost half. After the\ncollapse of the centrally planned and governed econ-\nomy, the gap has widened: in the first half of the 1990s\nthe annual average was 2.73, and in the second half of\nthe 1990s it was only 1.99.\n\nThe post-war development, although it related to the\npostulates of typification, standardization and indus-\ntrialization proclaimed by the interwar functionalism,\ndegenerated into the production of an extremely limited\nrange of prefabricated elements and construction tech-\nniques; they did not bring the desired price reductions\nor accelerated development. On the other hand, apart-\nments in the projects offered an upgrade, with cold\nand hot water on tap, one’s own toilet,” central heating,\nelevators, plenty of fresh air and light, and above all,\n\na relative abundance of space. The designers of the\nfunctionalist minimal apartment calculated an area of\n\n9 square meters per one adult; between 1970 and 1980,\nthis increased on average from 12.4 to 14.6 square meters\nper person, and finally the standard was adopted of\na3+1apartment with a usable area of 74 square meters,\nand a living area of 49 square meters.\n\nThe layout of new apartments was not only a\nmechanical consequence of economic requirements, as\nis commonly believed, but above all a distant echo of",
    "Page_24": "the functionalist concept of housing. It was assumed\nthat the use of flats would change to fit the idea of a new\nsocialist lifestyle. According to the program of ideal\nsocial functioning (a flat without a household), many\nhousehold activities - such as cooking, washing, or iron-\n\ning - were to be provided by external, state-run service\npoints. This has never been realized; on the contrary,\n\nin socialism there was shortage of virtually everything,\nand under such circumstances the role of the household,\nparadoxically, increased even further. Of course there\nwas no way that the apartments could fulfil the func-\ntions that the designers did not plan for.\n\nMoving out of the apartment block\nThe socialist state had no sympathy for single-family\nhouses.\n\nThe single-family house under capitalism\nbecame a stronghold of petty bourgeoisie. After\nall, the owner of a single-family home feels\ngreater class solidarity with other owners, and\nnot only of single-family houses. In his way of\nthinking, the seeds of individualism germinate;\nand the belief that his own interests should\ncome first is reinforced. When all this ballast\ngets to the broad masses of citizens of the\nstate, it immediately inhibits the development\nof society.®\n\nOf course, the broad masses of citizens of the state did\nnot cease to dream about a single-family home with\n\na garden as an ideal dwelling; furthermore, the state\nwas aware that the so-called comprehensive housing\n\n22 VLADIMIR CZUMALO\n\ndevelopment would not be enough to solve the problem\nof the housing shortage. From 1953, independent con-\nstruction of one’s own single-family home was allowed;\nlater, those willing to undertake it were additionally\nsupported by dynamically operating cooperatives. The\njoint studio of Stavoprojekt and the National Standardi-\nzation Institute issued templates of single-family house\ntypical designs, textbooks for amateur builders began to\nappear, and several journals covered the topic. However,\nall this happened on the margins of architecture. In\nfact, the type of the single-family house known from the\ninterwar period was simply replicated. Its roots went\nback to early modernism and since then it had matured\ninto a universal form, almost devoid of any style.\n\nThese new possibilities emerged only after the\nperiod of Stalinist traditionalism, and aroused the need\nfor a stylish single-family house that was an expression\nof modern life. Significantly, the need was satisfied from\nbelow, and outside the city centre: in 1967, architect\nJosef Vanék presented a new model of a single-family\nhouse. He built his first houses in the Sumperk district\nwhence they quickly spread to the villages and out-\nskirts of smaller towns throughout the territory of what\nwas then Czechoslovakia. The largest number of such\nhouses is found in northern Moravia. Researchers also\nfound one building just across the border, on the Polish\nside. The designer named his creation ‘type V’, but\nsoon people started talking about sumperdk houses. The\ndiminutive Sumperdéek was also used, clearly exuding\nthe bliss that the lucky ones felt when their dream of a\nperfect dwelling came true.

    "Page_25": "- which in the second half of the twentieth century\nousted rodinny dim — a single-family home - from the\nCzech language, signifies something more than the\nmodest size of individual buildings at that time).\n\nWhy was Sumperdk so popular? Josef Vanék\nemployed all his practical experience as a bricklayer,\nand he perfectly understood the needs and possibilities\nof a builder who did not have many resources at his\ndisposal, and had to do most of the work with his own\nhands. At the same time, the design bears clear formal\ntraces of the Brussels style, so called in reference to the\nsuccess of the Czechoslovak pavilion at the Expo’58\nexhibition in Brussels. The sources of Sumperdk can be\nfound in the Residéncia Prudente de Moraes Neto in Rio\nde Janeiro — a project by Oscar Niemeyer from the 1940s\n\n— but Vanék freely drew on and adapted from the original.\n\nThis was a translation of the 1960s modernity to a\nlanguage understood by a layman, so that the builders\ncould refer to it when working on the construction of the\nhouse and its finish.\n\nIn Sumperdak single-family homes, there was a clear\ndivision between the utility section and the residential\nsection. On the ground floor of the house of slab-on-\ngrade structure there was a garage, which also served as\na home workshop, a laundry room, a boiler room witha\ndrying room for clothes, and a fruit and vegetable stor-\nage space. A tiled, covered terrace occupied a quarter\nof the building’s plan. In the entrance hall, the stairs\nled to the upper floor with a living room, a bedroom, a\nkitchen-cum-dining room, a pantry, a bathroom, anda\n\ntoilet. The layout of the dining room\nand the kitchen area, the size of the\n\nbalcony and the sanitary facilities as well as built-in\n\nwardrobes clearly indicate a close relationship between\nthe Ssumperdk plan and the apartments in the block of\nflats. The house did not require a great deal of materi-\nals: simple concrete foundations, ground floor made\n\nof bricks, with a reinforced concrete ceiling slab on\n\nit, cellular concrete or brick upper storey, simple roof\nstructure covered with galvanized steel sheet. Giving\nthe house its character were the stone facing bricks in\nthe ground floor, the texture of the finishing plaster, the\nlarch wood moulding, the balcony railing — a graceful\nfield for the creativity of the builders.\n\nFor the entire two decades, subsequent houses were\nbuilt according to or based on Vaniek’s design, as imi-\ntations of Sumperdk or variations on his theme. It was\nnot until the mid-1980s that the stylistic features of the\nmodel were definitely exhausted, and the construction\nof Sumperdk houses was stopped. The owners of these\nbuildings began to modernize them, therefore in the\n1990s they did not become - unlike blocks of flats - a\nsubstitute attribute of socialism; the aversion to them\nwas rather generational. In order to understand the\nhousing situation in the Czech lands in the 1960s, 1970s,\nand 1980s, it is worth juxtaposing Sumperdk houses,\nat the time the most typical realization of a longing\nfor a room of one’s own, with apartments in a block of\nflats. Apartment blocks were built in many countries in\nEurope at that time, while the Sumperdk is an endemic\nCzechoslovakian phenomenon.\n\nAt the end of the socialist era, apartment blocks\noffered roughly 1.2 million flats and more than three\nmillion Czechs, Moravians, and Silesians found their\n\nFROM TOWER BLOCKS TO TOWER BLOCKS\n\nhome there. As late as 1995, the construction of the\n\nlast housing estates was being completed, and all the\nwhile the escape therefrom was already happening. It\nseemed a mass exodus at the time, because it was one\n\nof the ways in which people cut themselves off from the\nsocialist past. Blocks of flats and housing estates were\ntop of the list of its symbols, and it was a popular, com-\nmonly quoted opinion that socialism had thrown us into\nconcrete towers.\n\nIn the twentieth century, two fetishes of freedom\nwere established: one’s own car and a single-family\nhouse. In the Czech lands, both were making their way\nslowly. In the Masaryk Republic,’° the car was officially\nconsidered an anti-social luxury. The socialist state later\ntreated single-family homes in a similar way. During\nthe communist era, the car was as scarce as housing,\nso for many families both these symbols of freedom\nremained in the sphere of unfulfilled dreams. An escape\nfrom blocks of flats should therefore be understood as\na pursuit of a dream of an ideal home rather than a way\nout of an unsuitable way of living into a more satisfac-\ntory one. Already in the 1970s and 1980s, sociological\nresearch showed that two-thirds of the residents were\nsatisfied with their apartment in the housing estate.\"\nEven today, a third of the inhabitants of the Czech\nRepublic live in the projects, and these are definitely not\nonly the socially weakest people - as the gloomy fore-\ncasts of ghettoisation of housing estates were trying to\nscare us back in the 1990s. Some of the inhabitants have\nindeed been kept there by their economic situation, but\nwe must not forget that many of them grew up in the\nhousing estates and they identify with this environment,\nor at least they have got accustomed to its advantages.\nThe technical deficiencies of the tower blocks were\ngradually removed during the modernization; thanks to\ninsulation, new elevators, and the replacement of win-\ndows and sanitary facilities, the apartments now meet\nmodern standards. The interest in them is growing, as\nare their prices and rents get closer to mid-range.\n\nFor a long time, the determinant of a housing estate\nwas its unfinished, incomplete condition. After the\nimplementation of the absolute priority investment -\nthe construction of residential buildings — as a rule, not\nenough money was left for social infrastructure, not to\nmention greenery. The projects were commissioned dec-\nades ago, so by now the trees have grown, in the mean-\ntime, public utility buildings have been added, and\nthe network of retail and transportation grew denser.\nArchitects and city planners became interested in the\nopportunities for the development of housing estates,\nand the threats thereto.” The delight of the younger\ngeneration with the architecture of the 1970s and 1980s,\noften uncritical, does not weaken and, of course, it does\nnot bypass housing estates. Fortunately, the number of\nscientific studies on the history of architecture and town",
    "Page_26": "planning of housing estates is growing, therefore their\ninterest can go deeper and become more directed.* The\nappreciation for the projects also initiated the topic of\ntheir protection. There is a glimmer of hope suggesting\nthat the era of aversion to the monotonous uniformity\nof housing estates is nearing its end. The fight against\nthat uniformity, under the banner of humanization,\ndeployed coloured plasters on the facades; together\nwith polystyrene panels, glazing or enclosures in the\nbalconies, and variations on traditional roofs, they often\nturned the blocks of flats into pathetic caricatures.\n\nFor fugitives from housing estates to the rapidly\nexpanding suburbs, their former place of residence had\nprovided them with many valuable experiences; our\nsuburbs began in the projects. Some housing estates\nhave a population comparable to that of medium-sized\ncities, which however they are not. They parasitized a\nreal city - in much the same way as suburban districts\nof single-family houses are doing it today. As Léon Krier\nput it succinctly, both forms of housing can be called\nsuburbs without cities.“4 Planning solutions for housing\nestates are rarely successful, whereas an urban concept,\neven if it is a good one, is not always clear to an ordinary\nresident. Being accustomed to a certain irregularity,\nblurry indeterminacy of non-urban environment, just\nlike the experience of living in an environment without\nmemory, is compatible with the place where everything\nis not quite, or at best, same old. Both forms are neither\na city nor a village, also in terms of social contacts: in\nboth, anonymity reigns along with a closed nature of\nprivate life; there is no public space, thus no meeting\npossibilities.\n\nOne of the appellations given to suburbs as a new\nform of living in the early 1990s was “horizontal estate\nof tower blocks”. The term expressed the basic paradox:\nthe escape from the egalitarian herd of the housing\n\nestate led not to the paradise of\n\nindividualism but to a different kind\n\nVLADIMIR CZUMALO\n\nSumperak - a popular type\nof asingle-family house in\nthe Czechoslovak Socialist\nRepublic\n\ndrawing: Filo / Wikimedia\nCommons CC BY 3.0\n\nof herd. The form of houses also contributed to this (and\nit continues to do so). Mass production along with the\nrepeatability of available single-family house designs\naffects individual construction; marketeers quickly\nlearned to offer saleable goods to customers whose\ntastes were shaped not by architecture, but at best by\ntinkering with the décor of an apartment in the projects,\nor a woodshed in communal gardens. Therefore, both\ngroups do without architecture — indeed, in several\napartment complexes the architectural creation seems\nrather ludicrous. The suburbs are constantly growing in\nthe landscape like mould, and separating the cities from\nthat landscape. More and more new land is earmarked\nfor development around large cities. The mould also\nattacks older habitats that have wisely limited their\ngrowth with the aid of a zoning plan. It is enough that\nyou buy an older house, often modest - as in the First\nRepublic — or limited to one hundred and twenty square\nmeters and a maximum of five rooms, according to\nsocialist regulations; then you tear it down and build a\nnew, much larger one on the plot thus recovered.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, 5,989,538 passenger cars were\nregistered by the end of last year, which means that on\naverage, there is one car per less than two inhabitants\n(1.78 to be exact). In the suburbs, the ratio is more like\n1:1. There, life without a car is simply not possible. The\ncar-dependency line is somewhere between a popula-\ntion density of thirty and forty inhabitants per hectare.\nThe provision of public transport can be plausibly con-\nsidered with a population density of fifty inhabitants per\nhectare. Ordinary walking distances to shops and basic\nservices within a quarter of an hour start at a density\nof one hundred inhabitants per hectare. In the suburbs,\nthere is nowhere to walk to, or even to path to walk\nalong. The lack of public transportation infrastructure\ncontributes to the increase in the traffic of individual\nvehicles, and the economic and environmental costs\nof this state of affairs are borne by society as a whole\n\n14 L.Krier, Architecture: Choice or Fate, London:\nPapadakis Publisher, 1998.\n\n15 P.

By its very nature, a detached sin-\ngle-family house will never be environmentally friendly.\nAdding to the already mentioned needs for increased\ntransportation, infrastructure, and the impact of travel\nby individual means of transport on the environment,\nthere is something that I like to call the criterion of\nsocial acceptability. Seen from this angle, the age of\nCzech apartments is a positive feature. Residential\nbuildings have an increasingly shorter “useful life”,\nespecially in the suburbs. The problem is not limited\nto the service life of the buildings; it is also that soci-\nety stops accepting them. One generation made their\ndream of a perfect apartment come true by building\nSumperdk homes on their own, and as soon as the next\ngeneration came of age, those homes became the object\nof contempt. Children of refugees from the projects to\nthe suburbs are returning to the cities, and bringing\nelements of their lifestyle with them when they move\nin to the older buildings. The principle of sustainable\nconstruction means that we will not tear down tomor-\nrow what we have built today. What is the situation in\nthe Czech Republic in this respect? On the one hand,\nthe beginnings of architects’ ecological thinking can be\ntraced back to the 1940s. Currently, many interesting\nenvironmentally conscious buildings are being built,\nand extensive informational and educational activi-\nties are being conducted. On the other hand, statistics\nshow that, for example, the number of energy-efficient\nA-class buildings is growing at a slow pace. The only reg-\nular growth, at 6 per cent each year, is observed in the\ninterest in wooden houses.\" Reflection on the change\nof tone in Czech society has long been hampered by the",

We are asking: how can we have\nthe largest possible usable space, and use\n\nas little energy as possible? This conveys the\nimpression of being sensitive to the needs of “<t\nthe environment, and a person who thinks this\nway is immediately considered to be an enlight-\nened, prudent investor. Meanwhile, in fact, we\nshould start by trying to devise a social model\nor formulate a definition of individual freedom,\nand consider how to arrange ourselves in a\nsmall space - fairly and intelligently.1°\n\nA dream of one’s own home versus\npoverty\nThe Czechs willingly blame socialism for virtually all\ntheir failures, despite the fact that almost as many years\nhave passed since its collapse as Jesus lived, and a gen-\neration has grown up that have zero experience\nof the past system. It is precisely in the sphere of hous-\ning that we can see — apart from various excuses and\nalibis - that we are actually burdened with historical\nexperience to this day. Tenant-owned housing,\na favourite form of investment, still offers no guaran-\ntees: a tenth of the population of the Czech Republic\ncannot afford rent, and they are struggling with the\nlong-term problem of bailiff enforcement; in poorer\n\n \n\nregions that number goes up to 20 per cent.”\n\n25 FROM TOWER BLOCKS TO TOWER BLOCKS",
    "Page_28": "Today’s poverty is the leaven of tomorrow’s poverty.\n\nAsurvey conducted by the Lumos platform (a gathering\nof non-governmental organizations, professionals, and\nrepresentatives of the public dealing with the issues of\nsocial housing and human rights) revealed that 83,000\npeople living in 54,000 households are experiencing\nprecarious housing situation. Out of 9,600 such families\ncome 20,500 minors,!8, who are exposed to difficult liv-\ning conditions in orphanages, nursing homes, and inad-\nequate housing; sometimes they are placed under the\ntentative care of relatives or friends, and are exposed to\nfrequent relocations. The relationship between housing\nand school problems of children has been proven,\" as\nwas the inverse relationship of higher education to the\ntisk of poverty. However, we keep putting this malady\naside, we are not looking for a solution, instead, we only\nstruggle with the consequences; in addition, we are also\nplagued by the lack of legislation on social housing.\n\nRapid changes in social relations always follow the\nphysical law of action and reaction. In the early 1990s,\nthe restoration of private property as the primary form\nof ownership led to extreme situations. In 1991, the state\nand the municipalities owned 213,961 residential houses,\nin 2011 they were down to 48,146, and within twenty\nyears the real estate properties of the state and the\nmunicipalities decreased by 77 per cent.?° The dizzying\npace of re-privatization deprived many people of their\nhomes, but most of all it deprived the state and the local\ngovernments of an important tool for solving social\nproblems and in many areas it inhibited the develop-\nment of municipalities.\n\nThe ratio of the number of people living in sin-\n\ngle-family houses to the number of\n\npeople living in multi-family houses\n\nVLADIMIR CZUMALO\n\n \n\n(on the basis of a lease or rental contract) always reflects\nthe condition of a given society on many levels. Out of\n4.76 million flats certified in the 2011 census, 2.4 million\nwere in apartment blocks and tenement houses, and 2.2\nmillion - in single-family houses. In 1989, single-family\nhouses constituted 24 per cent of the housing stock,\nin 2019 their share increased to 52.8 per cent. Most of\nthe apartments are owned by private individuals, and\nsingle-family houses constitute a large part in this cat-\negory. The state constantly encourages citizens to buy\napartments, primarily with the incentive of low property\ntaxes and mortgage interest rate subsidies.\n\nThis does not mean that everyone who needs a mort-\ngage loan will get one. Under what conditions\nis mortgage credit currently granted? Each bank, of\ncourse, has its own requirements, but I will give youa\nrough example. Let’s say that I want to buy an apart-\nment for three million Czech crowns and that this\nproperty will be my warranty for the bank, of course,\nthis is after a careful examination of my financial situ-\nation. The bank will lend me a maximum of 2.7 million\nCzech crowns. It is not enough to have money set aside\nto cover the difference of 300,000 crowns; most likely, I\nwill also have to come up with the difference between\nthe default price of the apartment set by the bank and\nthe market price. I will pay various commissions to the\nbank, and the real estate agency will also collect theirs.\nFortunately, the real estate tax — formerly at 4 per cent\nof the purchase price — has been abolished recently. The\namount of the instalment cannot exceed 50 per cent of\nmy monthly income, so if I dare to take out a loan in\nthe maximum amount, and earn a monthly net income\nof 25,000 Czech crowns, with an interest rate of 2.5 per\ncent, I will pay off the mortgage a quarter of a century\n\nlater.”! The interest rate may change; you can also\nimagine how I will live on the remainder of my salary for\nthese 25 years, what will happen if I lose my job, etc. For\nthree million crowns outside the very centre of Prague,\nbut also not in the periphery, you can buy a studio apart-\nment of 25 square meters, with a separate kitchen, ina\nnewly constructed building. For the same amount, you\ncan buy a single-family house with an area of 100 square\nmeters on a plot of 435 square meters in a small village\nin Central Bohemia, though without infrastructure or\nefficient communication.\n\nThe number of families renting their apartment is\ndecreasing. According to the Eurostat data, in 2018 this\nwas 21.3 per cent in the Czech Republic, i.e. propor-\ntionally roughly the same as in Spain (23.7 per cent) or\nNorway (18.7 per cent), but more than half less compared\nto Germany (48.5 per cent), Austria (44.6 per cent) or\nSwitzerland (57.5 per cent). Is this a healthy trend?\n\nThere is still nothing being said about growing\nsocial inequality and poverty. Fortunately, the sociolo-\ngist Daniel Prokop speaks about this openly and compe-\ntently:\n\nThe most overlooked inequality in the Czech\nRepublic [...] is wealth inequality. In the Czech\nRepublic, the differences in the value of real\nestate owned are one and a half times higher\nthan income inequalities. Added to that, there\nare also differences in savings and other assets.\nWealth inequality is much more dangerous\nthan income inequality. Instead of inspiring\nmotivation, it leads to inheritance of poverty\nand perpetuation of social status. Income to\nsome extent reflects the person's efforts, but\nreal estate is mainly about whether and how\nmuch that person has inherited and how much\ntheir parents are able to help them pay off a\nloan, especially when real estate prices are\nrising, most young people cannot afford to\nbuy an apartment, and there are not many of\nthose available to rent. From the point of view\nof housing, the view on income is then com-\npletely different: it is still possible to earn fifteen\nthousand and live in your own house in a small\nmunicipality, but renting a flat in the city while\non the same salary is irreconcilable.22\n\nSince the beginning of the transformation, low mobil-\nity of inhabitants has clearly inhibited social change\nand economic development. According to the data of\n2018, in order to buy an apartment with an area of 70\nsquare meters in the Czech Republic one would need\nthe equivalent of 11 average annual salaries (to compare,\nin Belgium this would be 3.7, in Germany 5, in Poland 7.5,\nin France 8, in Great Britain 9.8).73 The average expend-\niture for the construction of one apartment in 2019 was",
    "Page_29": "3.55 million crowns for a single-family house, and 2.27\nmillion crowns for a multi-family residential building.\nIn terms of the average cost of constructing 1 square\nmeter of usable space, this translates to 26,572 crowns in\na single-family house, and 33,321 crowns in a multi-\nfamily building.\n\nThe average cost of rent in the Czech Republic in the\nsecond quarter of 2020 was 266 crowns per square meter,\nbut of course it varied from region to region. The capital\nwas the most expensive — at 299 crowns per square\nmeter — here, however, prices differed depending on\nthe district. In Mala Strana (Lesser Town), you needed\nto pay 365 crowns per meter, in Kralovské Vinohrady,\n334 crowns per meter, and in the periphery around 200\ncrowns per meter. The cheapest flats for rent can be\nfound in trans-border regions — from 73 to 100 Czech\ncrowns per square meter. Among other things, these\nnumbers reflect vast inequalities between the regions.\nIncrease in the rates of rent is constant, albeit irregular.\nIn Prague, for a long time rent has been growing at 7.4\nper cent year each year; of course, this is an average\nincrease, because in 2017, for example,\nit jumped by 12.5 per cent.\n\nIn comparison with other European capitals, Prague\nranks among the most expensive. It is cheaper to rent\nan apartment in Berlin, Vienna, and Budapest, among\nothers. We are currently seeing a downward trend as\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed tourist traffic.\nBefore the pandemic, in 2019, for the first time in the\nCzech Republic there were more tourists registered in\nthe accommodation than residents. The housing crisis\nis principally caused by short-term rentals of apart-\nments via digital platforms, such as Airbnb, which are\nseveral times more profitable for owners than long-term\nrentals. There are already about fifteen thousand such\nflats in the centre of Prague. In the centres of cities that\nare attractive from tourism point of view, we will not\nfind flats for locals; instead, the entire rental market has\nbeen adapted to the higher purchasing power of tour-\nists. The right of property and the freedom to conduct\nbusiness are still sacrosanct to the Czechs, and they still\nbelieve that tourism will bring prosperity to everyone.\nHowever, unlike the vast majority of European coun-\ntries, no measures have been taken so far to solve the\nhousing problems arising from tourism; we are only\nbeginning to talk about it, timidly.\n\ne\n\nFROM TOWER BLOCKS TO TOWER BLOCKS\n\n€\nHousing development at Holubi\nstreet in Prague\n\nphoto: Pavel Hrdliéka / Wikime-\ndia Commons CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nVv\n\nCentral Park Praha - one of\nnew housing developments in\nZizkov district in Prague\nphoto: SUu / Wikimedia\nCommons CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n18 Zprava o vylouceniz bydleni za rok 2018,\nJ.

In the short term, they\nresulted in commonplace conflicts between people;\nin the long run they strengthened the already deeply\nentrenched distrust towards the State, and added to the\ngeneral frustration of the day.\n\nEveryone knows at least one instance of injustice\nwhere someone got too little or nothing while someone\nelse gained too much. Our views as to why and how this\nhappened may differ, but the experience of injustice is\nuniversal. It continues to accompany Czech society to\nthis day.\n\nTo look at the events of the 1990s and the first decade\nof the twenty-first century only through the prism of\nthe open conflict between the old regime and the new\nideology, or between tenants and owners, would be a\ngross simplification. The opposing interests obviously\ninfluenced the direction of the public and expert debate,\nand even plainly shaped it. However, we can look at\nthese events as a chain of mostly bad decisions, made\nout of ignorance, reluctance, and indifference on the\npart of post-November politicians.\n\nAt the same time, it must be admitted that the State\ndid not have enough leeway to play any significant role\nin the emerging housing policy. The need to get out of\nthe all-embracing State control - symbolized by the\nhated waiting lists for housing allocation - was accom-\npanied by a new notion, formulated with the advent of\nthe neo-liberal ideology: “Let everyone take care of their\nown housing.”\n\n1 The changes related to the political transfor-\nmation in Czechoslovakia/the Czech Republic\nare often referred to as “November 1989”,\nby reference to the wave of protests — later\ncalled the Velvet Revolution — that broke out\nin November that year. Therefore, the second,\npopular term that also appears in this article is\n“after the revolution”.",

It would be best for everyone if the State\nstopped intervening in this area. The view spread from\nthe 1980s onwards all over the Western world. The Czech\nRepublic jumped on the speeding train of this ideology,\nbut, unlike most Western cities, it has not got off it to\nthis day.\n\nAlmost immediately after the revolution, the State\nwithdrew from the management of housing resources.\nSome were privatized, the rest was handed over to\nmunicipalities, and in some cases to enterprises,\nwhich later got rid of the donated apartments, anyway.\nContrary to other post-communist countries, the Czech\nRepublic did not enact any general regulations to stand-\nardize the procedures of municipal authorities and at\nleast ensure fairly equal conditions for all.\n\nIf the State supported anything, it was primarily\nthe transfer of housing into private hands - in the form\nof construction loans or mortgage loans; in the first\npost-revolution years such financial aid was unani-\nmously called for. It was not fathomed that any one\ngroup of people would “fall out of” the housing market.\nNobody considered social changes, such as migration\nto larger cities in search for work, or the increase in the\nnumber of people living alone. Thus, the State stopped\n\n30 GABY KHAZALOVA\n\nproviding housing not only to people in the most diffi-\ncult economic situation, but also to those who migrated\nto cities.\n\nHousing policy, which would deal with who has\nhousing needs and where, virtually ceased to exist. The\nmatter was left to the workings of free market. The State\nconfined itself to supporting the latter, and to regulating\nissues related to the legacy of the past regime. The activ-\nities covered three key areas: restitution, privatization,\nand deregulation. Today, hardly anybody is satisfied\nwith the course those activities took.\n\nRe-privatization: one got\n\na tenement house, and the\n\nother got nothing\nIn April 1991, a process began that had no analogies in\nany of the former Eastern Bloc countries: namely, the\nrestitution commenced. A bigger share than elsewhere\nhad been nationalized, and more radically so. Other\ncountries of the Eastern bloc, with the exception of Esto-\nnia, mostly paid some compensation to the expropriated\nowners; here, property nationalized after 1948 was sim-\nply returned to its original owners or their heirs.”\n\nIn practice, thanks to re-privatization, a new seg-\nment has emerged, namely, private rental.

    "Page_33": "of Prague, this covered as much as 70 per cent of the\nhousing market. Most people, especially in the 1990s,\naccepted this state of affairs and agreed with it, and its\ncosts were borne by tenants of flats in houses returned\nto their previous owners. In the past regime, they used\nto live in State-controlled apartments. They had certain\n— even if limited — rights, for example the right to\nexchange one flat for another.

O\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrent. Therefore, many owners tried to arrange for their\ntenants to take another flat or even evict them without\nany compensation.\n\nIn their defence, the owners cited regulations con-\ncerning controlled rents, which were much lower than\nthe market value. Some of the flats reinstated to the\nowners had been badly damaged, and the renovation\nrequired considerable financial outlays. Therefore, some\nowners sold their property, and others decided to sublet\nit to companies, foreigners, or new tenants.\n\nWhen re-privatizing real estate, the State did not take\n\nThe tenants have irretrievably lost their privileges, and\nhave never received any compensation in return. The own-\n\ners created a new group of stakeholders and, under the banner\nof protecting private property, they demanded the right to freely\n\nincrease rent or evict the tenants.\n\nOf course, it would be false to claim that all former\nowners mistreated their tenants after their ownership\nrights were reinstated. After all, we do not even know\nhow many of these people maintained the ownership,\nand how many sold their property. It is no secret, which\nstreets in Prague belong to influential foreign groups\n(or the mafia), but there is still no data on the scale of\nproperty sell-off in the capital.\n\nAlthough initially the re-privatization was hailed as\n“morally justified”, soon cases of tenants being pushed\nout without mercy (for example, by cutting off their\npower supply) changed this picture. From the discourse\non redressing the wrongs of the past, public debate has\n\nshifted towards conflicts between landlords and tenants.\n\nDeregulation: one lived cheaply,\n\nand the other did not\nThose who had to use the real estate market after\nthe revolution had a tough time of it. Mortgage loans\nwere still essentially non-operational, interest rates in\nrelation to purchasing power were unsustainable, and\nthere was a shortage of housing available to rent. Young\npeople just gaining their independence in cities found\nthemselves in a particularly difficult situation. Many of\nthem blamed this on rent control.\n\nFor example, in the districts of Prague 1 and Prague 2,\nthe number of flats decreased by almost 6,000 between\n1991 and 2001. If a flat for rent became available on the\nmarket, it was taken immediately. Inadequate legal\nprotection combined with the pressure of private capital\nforced the owners of rental flats to change the desig-\nnation of the property from residential to another. The\ncity centre was transformed into an office space because\n\nrenting offices brought much higher\n\nprofits than the controlled tenant’s\n\nthese problems into account, and then, when they hap-\npened, made no attempt to eliminate them. Deregula-\ntion was meant to be the solution. Rents were gradually\nincreased, and in 1995 a directive segregating tenants\ninto two groups came into force: those who signed\ncontracts earlier benefited from the controlled rent; but\nit no longer applied to new tenants. “If the gradual rent\nincreases were adhered to, they could have been regu-\nlated more fairly, according to income,” recalls Stanislav\nKyeéek, longtime president of the Tenants’ Association.\n\n2 The author did not include Poland, where\nre-privatization also meant the restitution of\nproperty, but the process began later than in\nthe Czech Republic (editor’s note).\n\n3 This and all the following statements come\nfrom the interviews conducted by the author\nfor the purposes of the article (editor’s note).\n\n4 Acolloquial term for the generation of baby\nboomers in the 1970s, when Gustav Husak was\nthe General Secretary of the Communist Party\nof Czechoslovakia, and then the President of\nCzechoslovakia.\n\nRESTITUTION, RE-PRIVATIZATION, DEREGULATION\n\nIn his opinion, the 1995 directive created a two-track\nsystem and compromised the essence of the regulation:\nit did not serve those in need, but only benefited the ten-\nants who had already signed a contract. Its costs were\nborne by the generation of “Husak’s children” entering\nadulthood. “We’d had controlled rents for ninety-five\nyears. Very few people realise that this was not an inven-\ntion of the communist regime. Rent control was already\nin force during the First Republic,” Kfeéek explains.\n\nAll those who criticized deregulation at its various\nstages did so with the situation of the most deprived\npeople in mind. “We knew we had to increase the rents,\nbut not in such a way that it would ruin part of our\nsociety,” recalls Tafia Fischerova today. When she was\nan MP, she severely criticized the 2005 law, tantamount\nto terminating rent control. At that time, about eight\nhundred thousand households benefited from rent-\ncontrolled housing. “I believe this is the greatest harm\ndone during the whole length of my political career.\nAfter all, nurses and pensioners must also live in cities,”\nadds Fischerova tartly.\n\nIn their analyses, already back then, experts agreed\nwith Fischerova’s diagnosis: they indicated that the\ncomplete abolition of rent control made many house-\nholds vulnerable. Housing benefits were too low, and\nincreasing them in line with the new rates of rent would\nburden the State budget excessively. Furthermore, even\nif all council flats were allocated to people threatened\nwith eviction, it would still not be enough. The situation\nwas particularly dire in Prague and the South Moravian\ncountry, where the highest increases were expected.\nUltimately, in some districts of Prague, rent control\nceased to apply as late as 2012, and not ~ as originally\npredicted — in 2010. Experts also pointed to the risk of\nghettos developing in areas affected by high unemploy-\nment.\n\nAt the time, ecologist Milan Smrz lived in a tenement\nhouse on Truhlayska Street in Prague. He remembers\nthe soaring rents. “We used to pay two hundred dime.\nClearly, this rate was unsustainable in the long run,\nbut in the last phase of the rent increase, it went up by\nCZK 5,000 during one year. This was far beyond the\nfinancial capacity of many households.” In 2003-2005,\nMilan Smrz was a councillor in the Prague 1 district and\na member of the local movement, which warned against\nthe effects of deregulation and even organized street\nprotests. “We feared that this would harm the weakest,\nso we wanted to at least slow down the pace of rent\nincrease and compensate people in the most difficult\neconomic situation,” he explains.\n\nHe does not mention a possibility of the deregulation\nbeing completely rejected. He perceives the movement’s\nactivity at the time as an attempt to mitigate its negative\neffects. He realised that the system was creating more\ninjustice as people benefiting from rent control were in",
    "Page_34": "a more privileged position than those in the commercial\nmarket. Yet members of the movement were unpopular.\n“We were not only against deregulation, but also against\nprivatization,” he says with a smile.\n\nPrivatization: one has always\n\nowned a home, and the other has\n\nnever owned one\n“We wanted to hold a local referendum on the distribu-\ntion of profits from privatization equally among those\nwho were not able to buy a flat,” recalls Smrz. “The\nallocation could reportedly amount to several hundred\nthousand Czech koruna per person. I was putting up\nleaflets in re-privatized tenement houses, but most of\nthe owners threw me out the door. Why? After all, it\nwould also be in their best interest if the tenants had\nmore money.” Even now, years later, he shakes his head\nin disbelief.\n\nThe movement did not like the fact that Prague 1 was\ngetting rid of valuable real estate for next to nothing.\nThe prices of the privatized flats ranged between two\nhundred thousand and three hundred thousand koruna.\nAbove all, however, the movement drew attention to the\nobvious inequity: some had the opportunity to buy a flat\ncheaply, while others did not, because the flats in which\n\nthey lived were given to the former owners or their heirs.\n\nRestitutions turned residents into ordinary tenants\nin the commercial market, while privatization extended\nthe quasi-ownership rights of the past regime. The ten-\nants of the houses nationalized after 1948 were simply\n\n \n\n32 GABY KHAZALOVA\n\nunlucky. Many of them invested in the apartments they\nlived in. If they were reinstated to private owners, in\nprinciple, all these expenditures were lost.\n\nIn some ways, privatization reproduced the\ngrowing inequality. Those who had a good\nstanding in the past regime, thanks to which\nthey managed to get an apartment, for example,\nin Vinohrady, were able to buy it very cheaply,\nalmost instantly. On the other hand, disadvan-\ntaged people living in controlled-rent flats were\nafraid of privatization because they would not\nbe able to afford the buyout\n\n- explains Jan Sladek, a sociologist and housing expert.\n\nThere were urban legends about the buyout of flats.\n“A bloke in a suit, with a briefcase, would come to visit\nan elderly man, and offer to buy the apartment on his\nbehalf and let him live in it until his death.” In this way,\nfraudsters were capitalizing on the fear elderly people\nhad of being evicted. In most cases, however, flats were\npurchased by their actual tenants.\n\nThis is also confirmed by Smrz. In his opinion, the\nproblem lay rather in the method of appraisal: the value\nof the flat was determined on the basis of the square\nfootage; the location was not taken into account. By this\ntoken, for the same price, some obtained an apartment\nin a prestigious neighbourhood that would be worth\nmuch more on the free market. “We wanted to block the\nsale of flats by the new owners for a certain period of\n\ntime,” he explains. Sladek believes that there was no way\nto do that: property rights were only just being extended,\nand any such limitation would be unthinkable.\n\nEven greater differences than those within one dis-\ntrict were visible between municipalities. Each municip-\nality and each district independently determined the\nterms of property sale. In some places, everything was\nprivatized, such as in Teplice under Jaroslav Kubera’s\nadministration. In other places - for example in Brno —\nonly part of the housing stock has been privatized. The\nprices and the pace of the process were also different.\n\nAccording to Sladek, the ubiquitous reluctance\ntowards centralization stood in the way of the common\nhousing policy. “Towns have also clearly decentralized,\none could even say that they have become fragmented.\nThe regional level would be ideal for creating a hous-\ning policy, but appropriate agencies or offices probably\ndid not even exist.” Today, the municipalities, which\nretained some housing resources and completed the\nprivatization process, are now mostly satisfied with the\ndecisions they made. They understand that an increas-\ning number of people cannot afford housing in the\ncommercial market.\n\nAnother problem is that many municipalities have\nnot reinvested the money obtained through privatiza-\ntion into housing projects. According to Sladek, we must\nalso remember that they often lacked sufficient funds to\nrenovate houses and flats that were in poor condition.\nThey simply had to get rid of those.\n\n“Nobody questioned the need for privatization. Still,\npeople had good reasons to be outraged at the way the\ntransformation proceeded. Politicians tried to appease\nthem by granting apartments,” Sladek recalls. Milan\nSmrz adds: “Here, in Prague 1 district, people universally\nagreed: everyone was in favour of privatization except\nus.” Experts from other post-communist countries, even\nHungarians, who are still paying the price of privatizing\nmost of their housing, were unable to imagine a differ-\nent path.\n\nVaclav Klaus's campaign\nposter in a toy store window\ndisplay, Prague, 1990\n\nPhoto: Jaromir Cejka",

According to the latter,\nthe free market will always solve all problems in sucha\nway that all parties are satisfied. In the post-revolution\nyears, few people thought that the effects of the market\nforces also resulted in unforeseen, far-reaching conse-\nquences. A typical example thereof is the sharp increase\nin inequality of access to housing.\n\nSimply put, it is not in the owners’ interest to seek\nsolutions to this situation, because they make profit\nfrom the high and constantly rising prices and rents.\nThanks to their economic advantage, they gain more\npower in society than those condemned to renting on\nthe commercial market.\n\nOwing to the ideological belief in the market, no one\npaid any attention to the processes and problems faced\nby the cities in the West, the more so as these problems\ndid not penetrate into the public debate. Only later did\nwe begin to be aware of the phenomena of gentrifica-\ntion, privatization of public space, or the growing areas\nof exclusion.\n\nWe just had to “deal with it” in the 1990s. In the face\nof the so-called large privatization, the housing issue\nwas pushed into the background, and its importance\nnotwithstanding, it continues to remain there still. Let\nus recall that until recently the media was uninterested\n\n33 RESTITUTION, RE-PRIVATIZATION, DEREGULATION\n\n \n\nin the housing situation of people in the Ostrava region,\nfor instance.\n\nThe RPG apartments are perhaps the best example\nof a failed privatization.5 For years, the entire region had\nbeen absorbed with the righteous anger caused by this\nscandal. Anyway, who would trust politicians who are\nunable to provide for one of the basic human needs, not\nonly for the weakest individuals, but even for the middle\nclass as well?\n\nUltimately, there is no difference between those\nwho criticize the State for the lack of council housing,\nthose who are distressed by high property rental prices\nin Prague, and those who were promised their own\napartments but got nothing. A roof over one’s head isa\nbasic right, but also our greatest concern in life, and our\nbiggest investment.\n\nIf we are uncertain whether we will make the rent,\nor whether we will be able to save enough for our own\ncontribution and then pay off the loan, we lose our main\nanchor in life.

In an atmosphere of scandal, the\nlaw was passed on 30 January 2020 by the Berlin Senate,\nruled by the coalition of the Social Democratic Party of\nGermany, Alliance 90/the Greens, and the Left. The first\npart of the law came into force on 23 February last year\nand resulted in freezing the amount of rent at the level it\nwas at the time; the second part, which took effect on 23\nNovember, determines the maximum rent for the prop-\nerty — calculated on the basis of the year of construction,\namenities, and location. The Berlin Senate estimates\nthat thanks to the new regulation, rent will be reduced\nfor three hundred and forty thousand apartments.’ The\ncompliance of this act with the constitution has been\nquestioned by members of legal and political circles\nalike, as they see it as violating private property protec-\ntion and hindering the operation of the free market.\n\nQuite recently, only a dozen or so years ago, Ber-\nlin was famous for cheap apartments for rent. In this\nrespect, it stood out not just from among the other Euro-\npean metropolises, but also other large West German\ncities - Munich or Hamburg. Why, then, was it necessary\nto resort to such radical measures? In this article, I will\npresent significant political, economic and urban devel-\nopments and phenomena that have led to the current\nsituation in the Berlin housing market. According to\nestimates for March 2020, the German capital is short of\none hundred and forty-five thousand apartments.®\n\nAn apartment for rent\nIn order to understand the background to the creation\nof the Berlin rent cap law, it is necessary to explain the\nspecificity of the housing market in the Federal Republic\nof Germany and its history in the divided Berlin. Ger-\nmany has a long history of rental housing. O\n\nAccording to statistics from 2019, every second\nGerman resident lives in a rented apartment. Com-\n\npared to other European countries, Germany is second\nonly to Switzerland in terms of the lowest number of peo-\nple who own the apartments they live in.”\n\nTOWN FOR SALE\n\nThis solution was made possible by the extensive\nsystem, existing until recently, of subsidizing rental\nhousing by the state — both social housing, and housing\nintended for the middle class with their higher earnings.\nThe rental of flats is managed by housing cooperatives,\nalso acting as developers. In West Berlin, they operated\nas joint stock companies, and their shares still belong\n\nto the city. Thanks to this form of housing support, the\n\nsupply of apartments was maintained at a high level,\nand at the same time the prices on the real estate market\nwere stable.\n\nThe tradition of the state supporting the construc-\ntion of apartments for rent dates back to the Weimar\nRepublic, when the right to housing was written into\nthe constitution. The modern housing estates created\nat that time were intended to provide healthy living\nconditions for people of various social status, and meant\na counterbalance to “the world’s largest city of tenement\nhouses”, as Berlin used to be called in the Grtinderzeit\nera. As land was scarce and expensive in the city centre,\nhousing estates grew mainly in the erstwhile suburbs.\nConstruction was carried out by state-subsidized\nhousing cooperatives. Six of these estates have been\ninscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. They\ndeserved this distinction for their pioneering character\nfor those times, including amenities that met modern\nhygiene standards. Furthermore, the cooperative move-\nment was included on the list of intangible cultural her-\nitage. Significantly, to this day only two of the modernist\nestates — the garden city of Falkenberg and Schillerpark\nin the Wedding district (both designed by Bruno Taut)\n\n1. S.

Flats in\n\nthe remaining housing estates were sold several times\nover, and eventually ended up in the hands of large-\nscale, profit-oriented development companies or private\nindividuals.\n\nAn apartment in the divided Berlin\nAfter World War IL, providing shelter to all citizens and\nhousing policy became a fundamental element of the\nCold War competition between the two German states,\nand the divided Berlin played a special role in this\nrivalry.? In terms of housing construction, both parts of\nthe city relied on public subsidies: the eastern districts\ndue to the nature of the GDR’s political system and the\ncapital-city importance; whereas West Berlin as the\n“window display of the West”, cut off from the rest of the\nstate, would be too risky a market for investors without\nthe financial support of the state.!°\n\nThe first major undertaking in the “housing battle”\nwas the construction of a socialist realist housing estate\non Karl-Marx-Allee (then called Stalin-Allee). West\nBerlin responded first with the Ernst-Reuters estate in\nWedding (which was ceremoniously inaugurated in the\npresence of President Theodor Heuss), and then with\nHansaviertel, the housing estate that originated as an\ninternational architectural exhibition.\"\n\nAfter rejecting the doctrine of socialist realism,\nwhich was dubbed a national tradition in the GDR, mod-\nern housing estates in East Berlin began to spring up\nboth in the suburbs and in the city centre. Construction\nactivities intensified following the announcement, in\n1971, of the “Resolving the Housing Problem” by 1990, as\none of the flagship policy promises of Erich Honecker’s\n\n36 MAEGORZATA POPIOLEK-ROBKAMP\n\ngovernment. It was then that the large housing estates\nof Hellersdorf, Marzahn and Hohenschénhausen were\nbuilt, with three hundred and thirty thousand apart-\nments.” Contrary to popular belief about the GDR,\nslightly more than half of the population lived not in\napartment blocks, but in buildings erected in the first\nhalf of the twentieth century, and much more new archi-\ntecture was created in West Germany after the war.!*\nThe inhabitants of nineteenth-century tenement\nhouses were in a particularly difficult position. The\narchitecture of their homes, identified with the capital-\nist past, was not being renovated apart from a few exam-\nples of revitalization projects (Arnimplatz, Arkonaplatz);\ntherefore, it was gradually decaying.* Any renovation\ninvestments were made impossible by the artificially\nmaintained level of rents, throughout East Germany,\nat the level they were in 1936. Despite the nationaliza-\ntion of the land, 41 per cent of the flats still remained\nin private hands. Since the low rent made it impossible\nnot only to earn money on rent, but also to carry out\nany renovation works, landlords often relinquished\ntheir properties to the state. Statistics show that East\nGermans lived in much worse conditions than West Ger-\nmans. In 1989, 99 per cent of western flats had a shower\nor a bath, and 98 per cent had a toilet; in the east, these\nfigures were 80 per cent and 73 per cent, respectively.’\nIn West Berlin, the main goal of housing policy has\nbeen the renewal of former working class quarters. The\n“first city revitalization program”, announced in 1963\nby Willy Brandt, Berlin’s mayor at the time, consisted in\nthe massive demolition of nineteenth-century tene-\nment houses and the erection of modern buildings in\ntheir place. The displaced tenants were offered new\napartments in the Markisches Viertel, Gropiusstadt, or\nFalkenhangener Feld projects, which were built on the\nthen outskirts of the city. The protests of residents in\nKreuzberg and Wedding as well as a reorientation in the\nperception of historicist architecture led in the 1970s\nto a modification of the planning course, and shifted\nthe focus to the modernization of tenement houses and\ntheir surroundings. An important condition for these\nchanges, known as “careful revitalization” (behutsame\nStadterneuerung), was the inclusion of townhouses’\ntenants in the redevelopment planning process and\nkeeping rents at a level that would allow them to return\nto their old apartments after those had been renovated.!¢\nBoth the implementation of revitalization projects\nin the city centre and the construction of new housing\nestates in the suburbs were carried out —- with enormous\nfinancial support from public funds — by cooperatives\nof pre-war origins, including DEGEWO and GESOBAU.\nThey also dealt with housing management: rental,\nrepairs, and administration. Some of the units built at\nthat time were developed as social housing; subsidies\nand cheap loans for their construction were granted",

Andrej Holm writes that, contrary to the “legend”\nabout the social nature of the flats then created, the\npurpose of the subsidy was not to provide long-term\nhousing for the most needy, but to build owner-occu-\npied flats while making real estate developers richer.\nThe state’s financial support lasted fifteen years, with an\noption to extend it for another fifteen. After paying off\nthe low interest loan, the owner of the apartments - in\nthis case a real estate developer — was no longer com-\npelled to keep the rent low and was able to set prices\naccording to the free market.!”\n\nThe above model of financing the construction of\nsocial housing by the state led to a situation in which\nlow rents and the status of social housing survived long-\nest in those housing estates that were built last - namely\nthe blocks of flats on the outskirts of the city. As a result,\nthe poorest people clustered there, and so these projects\nbecame ghettoized.'*\n\nIn West Germany, the fees in rented flats were kept\nlow after the war by central planning. This practice was\ngradually abandoned in the 1960s, due to the saturation\nof the market with apartments following the period of\nreconstruction after the war damage. Back in the 1950s,\nboth the middle class and the lowest-income households\nspent the same proportion of their income on housing;\nin the 1960s it was the poorest who paid proportionally\nthe most.” Since the 1970s, West Germany had been\nundergoing deregulation of the housing market and\nprivatization, and this trend intensified after 1989.7°\n\nLiving together\nAfter the GDR was incorporated into the Federal Repub-\nlic of Germany, both parts of Berlin found themselves\nin a completely new political and economic situation,\ndevoid of the former status of competing centres. The\ndecision to transfer the German capital from Bonn to\nBerlin in 1991 gave hope to the united city. Therefore, a\nrapid population growth was expected and it was from\nthis angle that the housing policy was initially pursued.\nLucrative tax benefits were meant to be an incentive for\ninvestors. Until 1996, those who built new facilities, and\nuntil 1998, those who modernized the existing ones were\neligible to apply.” It was mainly the buyers of flats for\nrent, well-earning Germans from the West, who bene-\nfited from the new regulations; they treated investment\nin real estate market as an opportunity to reduce their\nincome taxes.\n\nA major challenge for the unified city was the\nrestitution of properties seized in East Berlin. Applica-\ntions for restitutions could be filed also by those who\nlost their homes earlier, after 1933. In the districts of\nPrenzlauer Berg and Mitte, 70 per cent of the buildings\nwere returned to the previous owners or their descend-\nants. Many of them, overwhelmed by the enormity of\nnecessary renovation investments, resold the recovered\nproperty to development companies. Most of the long-\nterm rental houses in the eastern districts, which had\nnot been modernized, were in a deplorable condition.\nSoon after reunification, the city launched a program\nfor revitalizing tenement houses. They attempted to\nimplement it under the slogan of “careful revitalization”\nlike the one used in West Berlin. Due to the reduction\nof direct subsidies and to restitution, despite the tenant\nprotection program, the process of replacement of\nresidents began. Even during the revitalization process,\nthey began to move out of tenement houses and were\noften unable to afford the new, higher rent in the reno-\nvated apartments.”\n\nIn addition to the revitalization of downtown\ndistricts, the modernization of tower block estates was\nalso carried out, which differed in standard from their\nWest German counterparts. Large investments in new\nhousing construction were made in the 1990s, mainly in\nthe new suburbs of Berlin (Buch, Karow, Alt-Glienicke,\nand Rummelsburger Bucht), i.e. areas that had been\nearmarked for development even before 1989. In the city\ncentre, however, a policy had been introduced of con-\ndensing the existing building substance with facilities\nfor “new urbanites” — well-earning employees of global\ncompanies that opened their offices in Berlin.\n\nFrom unification until 1995, seventy-one thousand\nnew flats were built with the city’s support.” Despite\nthese investments, the population of Berlin began to\ndecline after 1994. In the mid-1990s, Senator for Con-\nstruction and Housing, Wolfgang Nagel, pointed to the",
    "Page_40": "need for a change in the city’s housing policy founded\non extensive subsidies: “In Berlin, we have reached\n\nthe financial limits of our possibilities in this regard.\nWe even exceeded them.”?5 Subsidized social housing,\nprograms to revitalize old buildings in West Berlin even\nbefore reunification, combined with the revitalization of\ntenement houses and the modernization of apartment\nblocks in the eastern districts have pushed the city into\nenormous debt.” Besides, any further support for hous-\ning construction was unnecessary, as in 1996 the hous-\ning stock increased by 6.4 per cent, with the outflow of\nresidents at 2 per cent.?”\n\nHence, the situation on the housing market was\nstable in the first years after reunification. The high\npercentage of flats belonging to municipal coopera-\ntives, new construction investments, subsidies for the\nrevitalization of tenement houses in the eastern part of\nthe city, and a smaller than expected population growth\nall contributed to the fact that in 2002 the number of\nvacant flats for rent was around one hundred and twenty\nthousand.”8\n\nAn apartment for sale\nFrom the mid-1990s, the capital of Germany took the\ncourse towards liberalisation of the housing market,\nand enabled its progressive privatization. The former\nmodel, in which housing construction was carried out\nby private enterprises using state subsidies and cheap\nloans, had been gradually abandoned in West Germany\nsince the 1980s, following the scandal related to the\nmisappropriation of public money by the Neue Heimat\n\nreal estate development company.”? Due to the widening\ngap in the city’s budget, Berlin politicians wanted to\nreduce debts at all costs. This strategy was part of the\nNew Public Management trend, which proposed the\nreform of municipal public institutions, aimed at mak-\ning them similar to free market enterprises in terms of\ntheir functioning. This concept was characterized by the\ndrive to streamline administration as well as debt reduc-\ntion through privatization — also in the housing sector.\nTherefore, the city sold building plots and real estate\nbelonging to municipal enterprises on a mass scale.\n\nThe scale of the land sale phenomenon is illustrated\nby the exhibition 1989-2019: Politik des Raums im neuen\nBerlin (1989-2019: Spatial policy in new Berlin) at the\nNeuer Berliner Kunstverein, organized in 2019. In\nher work Kartografie der Privatisierung (Cartography\nof privatization), Florine Schtischke calculated that\ntwenty-one square kilometres of land in Berlin had been\nprivatized since the unification, which is the equivalent\nof the entire district of Friedrichshain. After 1989, Berlin\nsold more than half of its land that was fit for develop-\nment; no other German city had disposed of so much\nland at that time.

    "Page_41": "private landlords, already in debt before 1989, could\ncount on debt reduction under the Altschuldenhilfe Act,\non the condition that they would sell 15 per cent of their\nresources. The act provided for flats to be purchased\ndirectly by the tenants, but in the entire East Germany,\nonly 20 per cent of flats sold in this way ended up in the\nhands of their occupants; in Berlin the figure was only\n5-6 per cent. A total of 277,000 apartments in the former\nEast Germany -— including 46,000 in the eastern part of\nBerlin - were privatized at that time.*! The sale of coun-\ncil flats also covered West Berlin. In the early 1990s, the\ncity owned 480,000 municipal flats, whereas in 2009 - it\nwas down to only 260,000.*?\n\nIn search of an apartment\nFrom 2007 on, the population of Berlin began to grow\nagain, and so did prices in the housing market. In\nthe years 2009-2017, the city experienced an average\nincrease of forty-five thousand inhabitants per year.\nLocal politicians seemed to hope that the real estate\nmarket would be able to respond to the growing demand\nfor apartments on its own, but this did not happen.\nThe insufficient number of flats on the market also\naffected rental prices - they grew at a dizzying pace. The\nresidents of Berlin began to split into those with the old\nlease agreements, and those with the new ones, as each\nre-letting of the apartment allows the owner to increase\nthe rent. Currently, those who wish to rent an apartment\nhave to pay much more than those who have been rent-\ning for years. People of limited financial means often\nrestore to looking for a place on the outskirts of the city.\nFor incumbent Berliners, “luxury renovations” present\na big problem. The owners of tenement houses carry\nout modernization (for example, they add balconies and\ninstall elevators), and the costs - usually high - can later\nbe incorporated in the rent. Legally, the city can pre-\nvent this type of investment from happening - among\nothers, thanks to the Milieuschutz (community protec-\ntion) program, which covers the areas threatened with\ngentrification. The goal is to protect the tenants against\nmoving out; investors are required to get approval for all\nrenovation works from the city planning office.\nAnother strategy is the extremely costly repurchase\n\nof former council housing by the city. In 2019 and\n2020, two spectacular actions were taken to buy out\napartments that had been sold after the reunification\nof Berlin. They were carried out by the city-owned\nGewobag cooperative. Nearly six thousand flats in the\ndistricts of Spandau and Reinickendorf were purchased\nfrom the Luxembourg-based Ado Properties corporation\nfor nine hundred and seventy million euros. These units\nhad been built in West Berlin in 1960-1990 as part of\nthe municipal housing construction program, and were\n\nsold in 2004.%4 In November 2019,\n\nsix hundred and seventy apartments\n\nTOWN FOR SALE",

    "Page_45": "On January 19, 2021, the Act amending the law on cer-\ntain forms of support for housing construction entered\ninto force. Under the mysterious appellation we find\nthe so-called Housing Package — one of the last projects\nproposed by Poland’s former Deputy Prime Minister\nJadwiga Emilewicz. The amendment introduces new\nregulations, more favourable for municipalities, per-\ntaining to the financing of housing investments, as well\nas a number of changes aimed at improving investment\nprocesses in the development of municipal and social\nhousing. The changes also covered Social Housing Asso-\nciations (Towarzystwa Budownictwa Spotecznego, or TBS\nfor short), and included, inter alia, the “participation\nsettlement” - that is, the option of redeeming tenant\nparticipation after five years of lease —- and the codifica-\ntion of the mechanism of “obtaining ownership” in\nnew investment projects.\n\nThere is another change worth mentioning:\ndespite the protests of the TBS community, it was\ndecided that the nomenclature that has been used\nsince 1995 should now be abandoned. The already\nexisting entities may retain their names, but the\nTBSs established after the amendment enters into\nforce will be entered in the official registers as Social\nHousing Initiatives (Spoteczne Inicjatywy Mieszka-\nniowe), abbreviated as SIM. This new nomenclature is\na good opportunity to take a look at the TBSs, which\nhave been present on Polish soil for twenty-five years\nnow. What exactly are they, what was their genesis,\nand how did they work during the first quarter of the\ncentury? And is there more to the name change than\njust the desire to rebrand the old trademark?\n\nNew order, old problems\nThe Polish social rental housing program started in\nearnest in 1995, after the Act on certain forms of support\nfor housing construction entered into force, although its\norigins date back to 1992.\n\nIn July 1992, economist Irena Herbst, an expert from\nthe Institute of Housing Economy, started working\nat the Ministry of Spatial Economy and Construction.\nThe new Deputy Minister, politically connected with the\nSolidarity movement-derived Democratic Union, was\ngiven a difficult task: to organize the transition-related\nchaos and create regulations for the emerging housing\nmarket, which at the time resembled - as she herself\ncalls it - a wilderness.\n\n1 Compare: E. Kuminek, “Memoriat Mieszka-\nniowy — Dyskusja zorganizowana przez klub\nparlamentarny Unii Demokratycznej”, Sprawy\nMieszkaniowe, Institute of Housing Economy,\n1992, no. 1-2.\n\n2 |. Herbst, “Nowy tad Mieszkaniowy”, Sprawy\nMieszkaniowe, Institute of Housing Economy,\n1992, no. 4.\n\n43 FAREWELL TO TBS?\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, there were no real\nestate development companies in the format that we\nknow today; housing cooperatives continued to be the\nmain investors in the field of multi-family housing.\nBanks did not grant mortgage loans to private house-\nholds - although this is a very common tool today, back\nthen there were no laws that would regulate the granting\nof such loans. The systemic transformation did not elim-\ninate the housing crisis that had lingered for decades:\nthe fledgling Third Republic of Poland inherited from\nthe People’s Republic of Poland a dramatic overcrowd-\ning and a massive demand for housing.\n\nA few months before Irena Herbst was appointed\nDeputy Minister, Jacek Kuron (then a member of the\nDemocratic Union) asked her to analyse the situation at\n\n \n\nthat time, but also to propose solutions that would help\novercome the housing crisis. Together with the econo-\nmist Andrzej Bratkowski, who would later become the\nMinister of Spatial Economy and Construction, Herbst\ncreated the Memoriat mieszkaniowy [‘housing memo-\nrial’ or ‘housing agenda’). The document, issued by the\nInstitute of Housing Economy, reverberated far and\nwide, mainly among the people associated with the then\nemerging local self-government structures, and dealing\nwith municipal housing management on a daily basis.\nIn March 1992, the parliamentary club of the Democratic\nUnion invited local government representatives from\n\nall over Poland to a discussion on the Memoriat. It took\nplace in the famous Column Hall of the Sejm (the Polish\nParliament). The participants of the meeting — also at\nKuron’s initiative - praised the document, mostly for\nthe pioneering quality of the proposed institutional, leg-\nislative and financial instruments that all the previous\nstudies neglected to address.! Herbst and Bratkowski\neven called for the establishment of the Ministry of\nHousing (the latter never happened - unlike the other\n\nplans and assumptions of the Memoriat, which were\nextended, clarified and successfully implemented in\nthe government’s reform program dubbed the “New\nHousing Deal”).?\n\nThe program developed by Herbst was introduced\nback in 1992. It contained a proposal for a comprehen-\nsive restructuring of the entire housing sector in Poland,\nas well as the creation, from scratch, of a coherent hous-\ning policy (practically non-existent at the beginning\nof the 1990s), which would take into account the new\nmarket realities and implications for the housing econ-\nomy, tidying up ownership issues, introducing mortgage\nloan institutions, and the principles of functioning of\nhousing cooperatives. O\n\nBoth the Memoriat and\nthe “New Housing Deal”\ndefine housing as a system\nbased on market principles and\nrights of ownership, but they\nalso highlight the role of the\nstate in providing every citizen\nwith a roof over their heads.\nThe need to create a program\nof social housing for rent,\naimed at people and house-\nholds who do not qualify for a\nmortgage loan, featured prom-\ninently on the agenda. One of\nthe main pillars of the program\nwas to be a new kind of entity\n— Towarzystwo Budownictwa\nSpotecznego (TBS, or Social\nHousing Association).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe name is a reference to the pre-war Towarzystwo\nOsiedli Robotniczych (Workers’ Housing Association),\na company established in 1934 by Bank Gospodarstwa\nKrajowego (BGK), Fundusz Pracy (Labour Fund) and\nother state agencies. The Workers’ Housing Associa-\ntion built flats for blue-collar workers and low-paid\nwhite-collar workers. And although its activity was not\nenough to overcome many years of neglect in the area of\nworkers’ housing construction, in the context of Polish\nconditions it can be credited with a substantial num-\nber of completed apartments of decent quality — by the",
    "Page_46": "outbreak of World War II, 2.2 thousand units had been\nbuilt, and the construction of approximately nine thou-\nsand more had been financed.?\n\nTBSs were modelled on institutions known from\nWestern European countries: French habitations a loyer\nmodéré (HLM), Dutch woningcorporaties, and British\nhousing associations. In its assumptions, TBSs are non-\nprofit enterprises; they play the role of an investor, they\nmanage residential buildings and work in close collab-\noration with local governments. They usually operate\nin a specific area and can function as limited liability\ncompanies, joint stock companies, or cooperatives of\nlegal persons. The main statutory tasks of TBSs include\nthe construction and operation of residential buildings\nwith housing units made available on the basis of social\nlease, aimed at people who are above the threshold of\nearnings that would make them eligible for an allocation\nof council housing, yet at the same time they do not\nearn enough to take out a mortgage. Optionally, TBSs\ncan administer the stock of council flats and conduct\nother activities related to construction and to housing\ninfrastructure.4 Some municipalities have decided to\nuse the extended option — for example, TBSs in Stargard\nand Szczecin successfully manage council flats, while\nthe TBS in Katowice is currently implementing a multi-\nstorey car park in the Culture Zone and an aparthotel in\nthe city centre.\n\nMost TBSs were established by municipalities, but\nprivate companies are also authorized to act as the\nfounding bodies (although it must be admitted that\nthe non-profit character of TBSs was never intended to\nbe particularly attractive from business point of view).\nAmong others, J.W. Construction boasts its own TBS.\nThe Marki Sp. z 0.0. (limited company) Social Housing\nAssociation built a huge block of flats in Warsaw’s Zerau,\nreminiscent of the architecture of the parent company’s\nresidential skyscrapers near the Wilanowska metro\nstation. In Krakow, the second largest city in Poland,\nthere is not a single municipal TBS (the Krakow Munic-\nipality has only minority shares in one of the housing\nassociations), despite the fact that in the 1990s as many\nas ten TBSs were established there, and eight of them\nhave survived to this day. The largest of those - TBS\nKliny Zacisze — has built 1,013 apartments to date. These\ninvestment projects do not stand out from the contem-\nporary architecture of other developer-built housing\nestates. The developer’s aesthetics is not accidental, as\nall of Krakéw’s TBSs are owned by private construction\ncompanies, and they consistently implement a policy\nof building commercial apartments for sale - the last\nsocial apartments for rent in the capital of the Matopol-\nska region were put into use in 2006. On the map of\nPolish TBSs, Krakow remains an exception; apart from\nRzeszow, every other main regional city can boast a TBS\nof their own, belonging to the municipality.

    "Page_47": "Among those to attend the consultation meetings was\nPiotr Mync, deputy mayor of Szczecin in 1991-1998,\nresponsible for housing policy (later, among others,\npresident of the Housing and Urban Development\nOffice, deputy minister for construction, president of\nthe TBS in Stargard, and now vice mayor of Stargard).\n“We were captivated by the program,” recalls Mync.\n“We lacked the tools to work in the new socio-\neconomic system. The program included an idea for\nsmoothing all the basic problems of housing, and it\nlaid the foundations without which it would be difficult\nto get out of the “trap” of multi-family housing at the\ntime. Cooperative housing was practically all that there\nwas, inflation caused a very substantial reduction in\ncontributions from building society passbook savings,\nbut also an exponential growth in interest on loans.”5\nAmong other things, the “New Housing Deal”\n(Nowy Lad Mieszkaniowy) section describes the\nsystem of TBS financing: funds for the construction of\napartments for rent were to be largely obtained from\npreferential repayable loans granted by the National\nHousing Fund (Krajowy Fundusz Mieszkaniowy, KFM),\nmanaged by the BGK bank. Postulates from the Memo-\nriat and the “New Housing Deal” regarding TBSs have\nbeen codified in the Act on certain forms of support\nfor housing construction. The new law entered into\nforce in November 1995 as part of a package of laws\ndubbed “the housing constitution”, and it introduced\nthree new tools: savings banks with contract loans, the\n\ntes Be =|\n\n45 FAREWELL TO TBS?\n\naforementioned KFM, and the legal institution of TBS.\nAnd so the modern social housing sector in Poland was\nborn.\n\nSelf-government pioneers\nOne of the pioneers of the TBS program, registered\nunder number 27, was the Szczecin Association for\nSocial Housing (Szczeciriskie Towarzystwo Budownictwa\nSpotecznego, STBS) founded in December 1996. Its first\npresident was Grazyna Szotkowska, a clerk from the\nHousing Affairs Department of the City Hall in Szczecin.\nAt the beginning of 2021, STBS merged with the Prawo-\nbrzeze TBS, and together they created the largest enter-\nprise of the kind throughout the country.\n\nFrom the very beginning, TBSs in Szczecin have\nbased their activities on several pillars —- apart from the\nconstruction of social housing for rent, they are also\nmanaging a large part of the municipal resources and\nbuildings belonging to housing communities, as well\nas engaging in the revitalization of downtown quarters.\nDiversification turned out to be the key to the success\nof a tenaciously implemented housing policy, which\nis a good-practice model for the region and the whole\ncountry. This is confirmed by the figures: STBS now\nhas a stock of nine thousand community flats, and it\nmanages an additional 5.5 thousand council flats and\nunits belonging to housing communities. Diversified\nbranches of activity and the city’s strong commitment\nallowed STBS to survive unscathed through the darkest\n\nl\nmT\n\ntimes of marginalization and curbed financing of social\nhousing from the state budget in the years 2009-2015.\n\nIn 1998, the TBS in nearby Stargard was established.\nIt quickly adapted the best Szczecin-derived models,\ntranslating them into efficient operation ina much\nsmaller centre: with the population of 70,000, Stargard\neven went a step further and handed over all its munic-\nipal resources for the TBS to manage. This approach is a\nmodel implementation of Irena Herbst’s assumptions.\nHer intention was for TBSs to build but also to take over\nthe tasks of the municipality in the field of the use of\ncommunal flats, which was to ensure efficient adminis-\ntration of the resources.

Investments implemented both\n\nin Szczecin and in Stargard are known for their attractive archi-\ntecture that fits the urban context, for high-quality finishing mate-\nrials, and well-planned common spaces. Decent playgrounds and\nfriendly green areas with an appropriate number of comfortable\nbenches, which are still sorely missing from many development\nprojects in 2021, in West Pomeranian TBS projects were already\npart of the standard at the turn of the century.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n“Nie Sami\" senior housing complex realised\nby TBS in Stargard Szczecinski (2011), design:\nDomino Grupa Architektoniczna\n\nphoto: STBS\n\n \n\n46 ZUZANNA MIELCZAREK KAMIL TREPKA\n\nIt was no coincidence, because Piotr Mync, an architect\nby education, from the beginning followed the ambi-\ntion not only to build as many apartments as possible,\nbut also to create high-quality spaces. Throughout its\nexistence, STBS has organized architectural compe-\ntitions in cooperation with the SARP (Association of\nPolish Architects), the Municipal Spatial Planning Office\n(formerly Municipal Urban Planning Studio), and the\nCity Architect.\n\nAmong the investments in Szczecin city, Osiedle pod\nKlonami [The Maples housing estate], built according\nto the design of the Wunsch and Wolanowski studio\n(2003-2004), deserves special attention. The frontage-\ntype organisation, clinker facades, and tenant front\ngardens in the complex of housing blocks evoke associ-\nations with British or Dutch townhouses. Although the\nproject’s overall formal expression fits in with the trend\nof historicising references that was commonly used at\nthe beginning of this century (and that was uniformly\nembraced by cooperatives, TBSs, and fledgling develop-\ners alike), it is distinguished by attention to detail anda\nfriendly scale of development compared to the stand-\nard housing complexes of its time. The architecture of\nanother project by the Szczecin TBS, Paska-Parkowa\n(2001-2003) transports us to the mecca of social hous-\ning: contemporary Vienna. The housing estate designed\nby Szczecin-based studio Domino Grupa Architekton-\niczna fits in well with the dense downtown develop-\nment. The facade is distinguished by solids covered with\nnatural wood, the windows are large, and the balconies\nare plenty. In the scans of analogue photos posted on\nthe SBTS website, only the cars and the clothes worn by\nthe passers-by reveal that this is Poland of 2003 AD. The\nDomino studio also designed the first housing estate for\nseniors that the Stargard TBS built in 2011.\n\nThe milieu of West Pomeranian TBSs makes an effort\nto popularize investment projects that apply the archi-\ntectural competition formula as a nationwide standard,\nbut in smaller cities there are often no adequate agen-\ncies that could formulate the terms of such competition\nand successfully conduct it. This does not mean that\nTBS competitions never happen. Although this is not\na rule, they do sometimes take place in both smaller\nand larger cities. For example, at the end of 2019, the\nTBS Wroctaw, owned by the city of Wroctaw, commis-\nsioned the innovative residential and service building,\ndesigned by Major Architekci, in Nowe Zerniki — and\nthe design was selected in an architectural competition.\nAn interesting hybrid has emerged from the investment\nproject intended for a range of different generations\n— half of the apartments are intended for seniors, half\nare standard apartments for rent, and the ground floor\nhouses care services and a kindergarten.

Among other\nthings, this resulted in a kind of residential folly: a\ngigantic “cruise-ship” of the Nasze Katy TBS, built by the\nWroctaw-based real estate development company called\nIntakus (today TFI Holding SA).\n\nThe first successes\n\nDespite the initial difficulties associated with the\ntime-consuming process of setting up and registering\n\n47 FAREWELL TO TBS?\n\nConstruction of\n7,151 social rental\napartments\n\n \n\nnew TBSs, the program was gaining momentum. The\nnumber of flats built thanks to it was growing steadily:\nin 1996 - the first full year after the law on certain forms\nof support for housing construction entered into force\n\n— TBSs commissioned fifty-nine flats. The threshold\n\nof one thousand apartments per year was crossed in\n1998; 1,218 social flats were built at that time. Just three\nyears later - in 2001 - TBSs built 6,605 apartments,\nwhich constituted 6.2 per cent of all newly completed\nresidential units in Poland. In the years 2002-2007, the\nannual number of all flats put into service stabilized at\nthe level between 4,500 and 6,000, except for the record\nyear 2004, when TBSs built 7,151 flats. They would never\nachieve such investment momentum again.\n\nBuyout of apartments |\nin TBSs is allowed\n\n \n\nContribution of wedding money\nUntil 2009, TBSs financed the construction of new\napartments for rent from three sources: from prefer-\nential repayable loans granted by the KFM, from funds\ntransferred to TBSs from the owner (typically, the\nmunicipality), and from the so-called construction cost\ncontribution, paid by the future tenants. Plots for the\nconstruction of the projects were contributed to the TBS\nin kind by local governments or private owners.\n\n“Tn the first edition of the social rental housing\nprogram, the implementation of an investment project\nwas difficult. Initially, the preferential loan granted to\nTBSs from the KFM could not exceed 50 per cent of the\nvalue of the project,” explains Piotr Mync. “Fortunately,\nthe establishment of a TBS, its registration, constitution",

It was\ncommon practice to divide the resources of the munici-\npal TBS into segments addressed to different groups\n\nof residents — depending on their earnings, the future\ntenant would pay a contribution of 10, 20 or 30 per cent\nof the construction costs.

    "Page_51": "of recipients, and therefore it applies different levels of\nparticipation in construction costs (according to this\npolicy, the required contribution towards a flat built\nunder the “home for a graduate” program is 15 per cent\nof the construction costs).\n\nThe necessity to pay the tenant’s contribution is\nprobably the weakest point in the TBS program. On\nthe one hand, it improves and even enables the imple-\nmentation of investment projects in municipalities\nthat are otherwise unable to provide the company with\nsufficient financing; on the other hand, it can be an\nobstacle on the way to getting a flat ina TBS and may\nlead to abuse and distortion of the idea of social rental\nhousing. Contribution at the level of 30 per cent in large\ncities often translates into dizzying amounts, exceeding\nthe required minimum own contribution necessary to\nobtain mortgage credit for a similar apartment. This is\na paradox, as TBSs were supposed to be an alternative\nfor people who cannot afford a loan. On the website of\nthe Warsaw City Hall we find information that in the\nnewly-implemented investment project, the amount of\ncontribution per square meter is “only” 2,805 ztoty (i.e.\n30 per cent of the cost of building the flat, which is 9,350\nztoty per square meter). The future tenant of an apart-\nment with a size of fifty square meters must therefore\npay the contribution in the amount of one hundred\nand forty thousand ztoty, and added to that, a deposit\nequivalent to one year’s rent. This places contribution,\nas an expense, somewhere between the amount of own\ncontribution to the loan, and the purchase of an entire\napartment. Of course, in the event of pulling out from\nthe TBS, it is possible to redeem the contribution paid\n— furthermore, the amount is subjected to valorisation,\nwhich means that the actual sum redeemed is higher\n— therefore, it is sometimes (rightly) treated as a capi-\ntal investment. Before you invest, though, you need to\naccumulate considerable funds, which in many cases\nmakes taking out a loan necessary.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem that the amount of\ncontribution could scare potential tenants away — and\nyet, this is contradicted by the considerable interest that\nTBS apartments enjoy on local markets. “When recruit-\ning tenants for one newly built flat in the TBS system,\nthere are four applicants on average, and for the flat that\nis vacated, there are often as many as a dozen or so,\" says\nJanusz Olesinski, president of the TBS in Katowice. “In\nthe past, in Katowice, we experienced some problems\nwith large apartments that required greater financial\ncommitment. At that time, however, the Building Soci-\nety lowered the amount of the contribution required.\nToday, the problem of the lack of people willing to buy\ninto a TBS apartment no longer exists.”\n\nPiotr Mync recalls that in the early years of opera-\ntion, the monthly rent was a greater obstacle than the\ncost of a one-off contribution. “Young married couples\n\n49 FAREWELL TO TBS?\n\n( I )\n\nwere able to afford the contribution if they had a big\nwedding and they managed to raise enough cash there,\nbut they were not necessarily earning enough to pay\n\nthe rent. Thus, while in real money the contribution\n\nhas increased in relation to income, the rent in TBS\nflats, quite the reverse: it is now a smaller portion of the\nessential expenses of an average household. In addition,\nbanks are not currently offering loans to cover the con-\ntribution, as they used to.”\n\n“Will sell flat in TBS”\nAds with the above content can be found on the Internet\ntoday. Of course, they are not about selling the property,\nas it is not an owner-occupied flat. So why is it possible\nto “sell” or “buy” an apartment in a TBS?\n\nTenant contribution was supposed to be optional,\nbut with time it became an important component of the\nbudget of most investment projects. In turn, residents\noften treat the funds they paid as their own contribu-\ntion, and in the event of their resignation from the lease\nthey try to speculate on that. In theory, the Building\nSociety takes priority in terms of choosing and assign-\ning a new tenant, while the latter — also in theory — only\npays the contribution amount. However, the tenant\ngiving up the lease on the apartment has the right to\ntransfer the lease contract to a specific person that she\nnominates. If the “client” who responded to the adver-\ntisement meets the income conditions required by the\ngiven TBS, the person leaving the apartment can earn\nquite a lot of money. Additional “compensation” paid by\nthe new tenant to the one moving out could amount to\nseveral dozen or even hundred thousand Polish ztoty. O\n\nIllegal transactions\nare made to the detri-\nment of those on the waiting\nlist. In 2019, regulations were\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nregulated to curb this “trading”\n— today, the consent of the\nBuilding Society is required for\nthe transfer of a TBS apart-\nment. The situation resembles\nthe commodification of family\nallotments, which were never\nintended to be a market prod-\nuct. They were invented so that\nthey would serve a social pur-\npose, yet they have been sold\n“under the table” for several\nyears.\n\nSo long, KFM!\nIn the first years of the PO-PSL government, the social\nhousing for rent sector lost momentum in terms of\ninvestment dynamics. The government gradually\nreduced the outlays for financing the KFM from the state\nbudget: in 2007, they added 408.2 million ztoty; in 2008,\nthe subsidy dropped to 220 million ztoty, and in 2009,\ndown again, to only 150 million ztoty — the lowest level\nof budget expenditure on KFM since 1999. Ultimately,\nfor reasons that are incomprehensible today, and\ndespite huge protests from local governments and the\nTBS community, the PO-PSL coalition decided to dis-\nsolve the KFM. Interestingly, the bill cancelling the fund\n(that entered into force in May 2009) was supported by\nthe whole range of political parties in the then Sejm,\nfrom SLD to PiS.\n\nProfessor Anna Szelagowska from the Warsaw\nSchool of Economics calls the liquidation of KFM one\nof the “biggest mistakes of the state’s housing policy”.®",
    "Page_52": "The decision left the people associated with the TBSs\nperplexed. “Until the end, we did not believe that this\ncould happen,\" says Piotr Mync, who in 2009 was the\npresident of the Stargard TBS. “It just seemed so absurd,\nso wasteful, so damaging to the only housing sector that\ndeveloped in the new times. It is often said that TBSs\nand housing cooperatives built only one hundred thou-\nsand apartments with the KFM. In certain years, with\nthe actual demand worth a billion and several hundred\nmillion ztoty, less than two hundred million ztoty had\nbeen reserved in the state budget for the purpose. If all\nthe correctly submitted applications were implemented\nthroughout the entire time of KFM’s operation, there\nwould be many, many more flats. We were surprised\nand outraged that in 2009 the fund ceased to exist,\nespecially since until 2015 no other tool was proposed\nto support the development of the rental housing sector\nwith moderate rents.”\n\nToday it is impossible to reconstruct the reasons\nbehind the liquidation of the KFM. Various hypotheses\narise: one is that the government wanted to allocate\nthis money to buy out a stake in PKO BP bank, another\nis that the KFM fell victim to the personal dislike of\nPiotr Styczeni, the deputy minister of infrastructure\nresponsible for housing in 2005-2013, and the creator of\npro-ownership programs for mortgage loan subsidies,\ncalled “Rodzina na Swoim” [Family in their own home]\nand “Mieszkanie dla Mtodych” [Flat for the young].\n\n“When the KFM was being liquidated, I had a terrible\nfight with one of the MPs from the PO-PSL coalition,”\nrecalls Irena Herbst with bitterness. “I asked him: ‘How\ncan you vote for the liquidation of KFM?’ He replied:\n\n“We were promised that if we voted for the liquidation of\nKFM, the money would be allocated to road infrastruc-\nture.’ Then I said to him: ‘It won't, you'll see.’ And of\ncourse, it wasn’t!” If the government at the time had not\ndecided to abolish the KFM and kept it separate, accord-\ning to Herbst’s calculations, in 2018 the fund would\nhave had approximately three hundred and fifty million\nztoty of free resources, coming from the repayments\n\nof previously incurred loans; and in 2019 - as much as\nfive hundred million ztoty. Therefore, it would be able\nto grant new repayable loans on a similar scale as in the\nbest period of its operation, and that would be without\nhaving to use subsidies from the state budget.\n\nDeprived of preferential credits, TBSs had to reinvent\nthemselves in the new reality. In order to maintain the\nconstruction activity, some societies abandoned the\noriginal assumptions of the program and started build-\ning condos - that is, tenant-owned flats. Those TBSs,\nwhich also managed municipal resources on behalf of\nthe municipalities, were in a better position than those\nthat were building only social flats for rent, but all of\nthem faced problems with financing new investment\nprojects. Piotr Mync explains the context of those times:\n\n50 ZUZANNA MIELCZAREK\n\n“A TBS without investment activity is not ‘it’ anymore.\nIt is impossible to pursue an ambitious housing policy\nthis way. In order not to stop investing, we then decided\nto go for flats financed by the BGK Subsidy Fund, whose\nmain task is to bankroll the construction of social flats\nand council housing. For this reason, we automatically\nstopped offering flats for families with average earnings,\nbecause flats from the Subsidy Fund are intended only\nfor people from the municipal queue.”\n\nWith the PiS government taking power in 2015, the\nconcept of the so-called “lease leading to ownership”\ngained popularity: the tenant pays an increased rent\nwith the view to ultimately becoming the owner of the\napartment. Thanks to the favourable credit line at the\nBGK, certain Building Societies, for example those in\nPoznan or Katowice, are building some of their apart-\nments according to this formula. “The TBS in Katowice\n\n \n\nfollows the ‘tailor-made’ strategy,” explains Janusz\nOlesiriski. “We cater to three groups of clients: people\nwith low, medium, and high income. To families from\nthe first two groups, we offer classic apartments for rent\nin the TBS system. To the more affluent clients, we build\n‘leading to ownership’ apartments where the contribu-\ntion is 50 per cent of the construction costs, and tenants\npay an increased rent.”\n\nThe TBS belonging to the city of Katowice focuses\non the construction of apartments for rent. Janusz\nOlesiriski supports this strategy: “If I were to define the\n\nKAMIL TREPKA\n\nideal proportions of our construction activity, I would\nsay that the Katowice TBS should develop 80 per cent of\napartments for rent, with the remaining 20 per cent of\napartments offered for sale on the commercial market\nor with the option of obtaining ownership. We wish to\nallocate the funds obtained from the sale of these apart-\nments to our social projects, for example the revitaliza-\ntion of tenement houses in Mariacka street.” It is there\n\n— in one of the most famous places in Katowice - that\nKTBS plans to rebuild three neglected pre-war tenement\nhouses based on a design selected in an architectural\ncompetition in 2019. The investment, designed by the\nKatowice-based studio OVO Grabczewski Architekci,\ninvolves the construction of forty apartments for seniors\nand university graduates.\n\nA new beginning?\nTowards the end of the second term of the PO-PSL\ncoalition government, the attitude of decision-makers\ntowards the housing-for-rent sector slowly started to\nchange. In September 2015, at the eleventh hour before\nthe upcoming parliamentary elections, the Sejm revised\nits 2009 mistake and restored preferential crediting of\nsocial housing for rent, which was a huge success for the\nentire TBS community. BGK had also become the opera-\ntor of the new support program, known today under the\ntrade name of Spoteczne Budownictwo Czynszowe (Social\nRent Construction). Gradually, the number of flats\ncommissioned by TBSs began to grow again — from 1,265\nflats in 2015 to 2,472 in 2019. Unfortunately, the trend\nturned out to be short-lived. Despite the record-breaking\nconstruction activity in 2020 - the total of 222,000 apart-\nments were built throughout Poland - the number of\nflats completed by the TBSs decreased drastically. Last\nyear, Building Societies put to use only 1,035 apartments;\nthis is the worst result of the social housing sector since\n1997.\n\nSacred Property and the path\nthereto\nIn the original assumptions of the creators of the Polish\nsocial housing system, the units built by TBSs were to\nremain permanently in the stock of flats for rent.\nA month before the parliamentary elections in 2011, the\nSejm — just like two years earlier, when it liquidated\nthe KFM - almost unanimously voted to enable the pur-\nchase of flats by the tenants. However, the regulations\nhad been designed in such a way as to discourage the\nbuyout as far as possible. Zdzistaw Stabkowicz, the then\npresident of the Polish Chamber of Commerce\nof the Building Societies, explained the new regulations\nin Rzeczpospolita’ paper: “Tenants are counting on\ngetting discounts. Meanwhile, the amendment requires\nthe sale of units at market price, at least; and this applies\nto cooperative flats as well. You also have to pay off the",
    "Page_53": "mortgage burden on the apartment. So it simply isn’t\nworth it; it is better to give up renting a flat in the TBS,\nget the reimbursement of your contribution, and buy a\nnew flat from the developer.””\n\nThe community of people associated with local gov-\nernment TBSs was mostly against the idea of housing\nprivatization. Irena Herbst, the creator of the TBS pro-\ngram, was also among those dissatisfied: “I am totally\nagainst the privatization of TBS resources. If someone\nabsolutely wants to live in a tenant-owned apartment,\nthen they should leave the stock of social resources cre-\nated specifically for people who need it. We still have a\nhuge shortage of the apartments with accessible rent! It\nwas primarily private TBSs that lobbied for the possi-\nbility of privatizing TBS flats, whereas the much more\nnumerous municipal TBSs were against it.” O\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nin the TBS system concerns the vocabulary. The name\nSpoteczne Inicjatywy Mieszkaniowe (Social Housing\nInitiatives] brings to mind misleading associations\nwith housing cooperatives and a greater participation\nof grassroots ventures, while in fact the nature of the\nTBSs’ activities has not been significantly modified,\nexcept for the so-called “settlement of contribution in\nthe cost of building the apartment”. From January 1,\n2022, a tenant of a TBS flat, who has been a party to the\nlease agreement for at least five years, will be entitled to\nrecover the contribution paid by her in full or through a\nperiodic reduction in rent (i.e. she can go on a so-called\n“rent holiday”), of course, provided that the given TBS/\nSIM has repaid the preferential loan from the BGK\nbank. If the tenant has paid more than 20 per cent of\nthe contribution (25 per cent in the capital of the region\nora city with the status of a district, with a population\n\nIn the period of early transformation, and in the first decade\nof the twenty-first century, the promotion of property — of\n\nownership — as a superior value left its mark on both housing pol-\nicy and need creation: the need to own a flat at all costs. Since\n2015, we have been cleaning up the chaos in the wake of pro-\nownership loan subsidy programs. Despite this, both in the “Miesz-\nkanie Plus” investments and in the TBS system, against experi-\nence and despite the shortage of social housing, the State places\ngreat emphasis on the possibility of depleting this resource by\npromoting the aforementioned “lease leading to ownership”.\n\nMost of the milieu connected with TBSs does not\nshare the enthusiasm for this mechanism that those\nin power seem to have. “The TBS in Szczecin does not\noffer flats for rent with the ‘lease leading to ownership’\noption,” explains Grazyna Szotkowska. “Personally, as\nthe president of the board, I think that it is pointless for\nTBSs to build this type of apartments, and of course it\nwould be completely senseless for this to be their core\nbusiness. From 2009 to 2015, that is, during the stag-\nnation of housing support, the construction of flats on\n‘lease leading to ownership’ basis became popular. TBSs\nthen began to offer this option in order to fill the gap in\ntheir investment activities. Currently, the system has\nbeen structured by legal regulations, but in my opinion,\nmunicipal TBSs should be careful with such activities,\nand treat them as supplementary and secondary to the\n\nconstruction of classic, TBS-proper apartments for rent.\n\nIs SIM still a TBS?\n\nWhen reading the new law that introduces the Housing\n\no1\n\nPackage, one gets the impression that\nthe biggest change that has taken place\n\nFAREWELL TO TBS?\n\nof over one hundred thousand inhabitants), she will be\nable to convert her existing contract into a “lease leading\nto ownership” agreement.’ The government assures us\nthat the decision on whether tenants of social flats built\nbefore the entry into force of the Housing Package will\nbe able to “acquire ownership” in this mode should rest\nwith the owners of the TBSs. However, there are doubts:\nit may seem that the transitional provisions of the Act\nwere structured in such a way as to oblige municipali-\nties to take that decision, and thus open the door to the\nprivatization of the TBS resources ~ as it is still unclear\nwhether municipalities that decide not to introduce the\npossibility of transforming old lease contracts into those\nwith the “leading to ownership” option will be able to\nuse new, more favourable instruments for financing\ninvestment projects introduced under the Housing\nPackage.\n\nDespite the adversities, the social housing associa-\ntions survived and became one of the most interesting\nelements of the housing policy of the Third Polish\nRepublic. In the years 1996-2020, TBSs built 74.7 thou-\nsand new units, which is 2.2 per cent of all apartments\n\ncommissioned in that period. Although these numbers\nmay not seem very impressive, thanks to TBSs, we have\nexperienced some kind of version (albeit a poor substi-\n\ntute) of Western European housing policy in Poland.\n\nUsing the experience of foreign colleagues, individu-\nals involved in launching the program and creating TBSs\nhave implemented - and still continue to implement - a\npioneering, non-profit model of social housing. Thanks\nto the architectural competitions, many TBS projects\ncan be considered exemplary in terms of caring for the\nquality of space. Piotr Mync explains the uniqueness\nof TBSs: “A dynamic environment of experts who care\nabout housing construction has accumulated around\nsocial housing associations. Admittedly, not everyone\nconsiders this a priority issue, as it is not very spectacu-\nlar in terms of political actions and profits.”\n\nJanusz Olesiniski emphasizes that mutual support\ngiven to each other by self-government owned TBSs is of\ngreat value: “Social housing associations have this very\ncool feature: they freely share their good practices. If\nthe management of one of the TBSs has introduced an\ninteresting solution, they are happy to share it with rep-\nresentatives from other TBSs. This is probably because\nthe municipal TBSs do not compete against each other.\nEach society is building homes only within its own ter-\nritory. The TBS in Katowice builds only in Katowice, and\nnot, for example, in Chorzéw or Sosnowiec.”\n\nAnswering the title question: SIMs are still TBSs,\nalbeit under a changed name. Therefore, we do not bid\nfarewell to entities that for over twenty-five years\nhave been implementing the program of social rental\nhousing in the form that we known. On the contrary,\nwe are observing their further development with hope\nand curiosity. Our interlocutors unanimously recog-\n\n \n\nnize the TBS program as a success. We strongly support\nsocial housing associations so that they not only main-\ntain their current pool of resources, but also gradually\nincrease it. @\n\n7 R.Krupa-Dabrowska, Wykup mieszkan w TBS i\nspdtdzielniach mozliwy od 11 pazdziernika 2011,\nRzeczpospolita, 10 October 2011, https://www.\nrp.pl/artykul/729227-Wykup-mieszkan-w-T B-\nS-i-spoldzielniach-mozliwy-od-11-pazdzierni-\nka-2011.html (accessed: 28.02.2021).\n\n8  Ustawa z dnia 10 grudnia 2020 r. 0 zmianie nie-\nktdérych ustaw wspierajacych rozw6j mieszkal-\nnictwa [Law of 10 December 2002 amending\ncertain Acts supporting housing construction],\nDz.

In psychology, this\nattitude is called denial, and it can lead to amne-\nsia and numerous psychosomatic disorders.\nGated communities are a symptom of denial in\ncities.\n\nSince the end of the 1990s, the issue of gated commu-\nnities has inflamed the milieu of people associated\n\nwith urban issues in Poland. It was then that such\nhousing estates first appeared in our country. The first\nPolish gated community was most probably an enclave\nof single-family houses, built in Piaseczno. Zbigniew\nNiemczycki, the real estate developer responsible for\n\nits construction, had returned from America not long\nbefore that. From overseas, he brought not only the idea\nfor the estate being gated, but also for the houses - lit-\nerally — to be put together from prefabricated elements.1\nThe gated community debate has gone through the\nstages of curiosity, surprise, anxiety, indignation, and\nfinally, it seems, a kind of resignation. An impasse was\nreached: the professional community agrees that it is\n\na harmful phenomenon both from the point of view of\nspace and the functioning of society, but this consensus\ndoes not translate into material reality.\n\nTwo themes dominate the discourse on gated\ncommunities: the spatial and the social; several others\nfit within their narrative. The spatial thread is simpler.\nGated communities are “walled off or fenced off housing\nunits with limited public access”; and this thread\nanalyses the degrees and methods of limiting access,\nand their impact on the surrounding space. We are\ntalking about communication barriers,’ about the dis-\nruption of urban continuity, but also about monotony\nand ugliness of fences and related inconvenience.\n\nThe social thread is much more ambiguous and\nit consists of many narratives. The first one connects\nthe popularity of gated communities with the natural\nprocesses resulting from the political transformation\nand the transition from an inefficient socialized system\nto an idealized free market economy. According to this\nnarrative, the reasons for fences include distrust in pub-\nlic institutions and the liberal belief held by the middle\nclass that housing is a completely private affair.4 In this\nnarrative, a gated community becomes a synonym of\nresourcefulness and ennoblement.\n\nThe simplest explanation, often accepted intuitively\nand unreservedly, points to the feeling of danger or\nthreat as the main basis for the decision to live behind\nclosed gates. According to this - second — narrative,\ngated communities are a direct response to the need for\nsecurity, one of the most important human needs. This\npoint of view makes the fight against fences particularly\ndifficult.\n\n61 DENIAL SYNDROME\n\nThe individual narratives intertwine and overlap, and\nthus the second narrative turns into the third one -\nrelated to the commodification of fear, and then com-\nmodification in general. The fences and the system of\nprotection, and finally a sense of security, are indicated\nin it as another commodity for sale (Zygmunt Bauman\nwrote about it in his Liquid Life: “marketing experts find\nthe anxiety [...] to be potentially inexhaustible source of\nprofits”>), and because it is affected by market demand\nand supply mechanisms, it is subject to marketing\nefforts. Therefore, if it is profitable for business entities\nto sell flats in gated communities, they will tend to exag-\ngerate the threats posed by the outside world in their\nadvertisements and in public communications.\n\nThe fourth narrative changes the frame of fear into\na frame of cooperation.® It emphasizes the intentional\nside of fences, and the opportunity they present for cre-\nating lively neighbourly communities whose members\nact for the common good, support each other, and strive\nfor synergy. At this point, the narrative accompanying\ngated communities coincides with that of bottom-up\nhousing initiatives, that is housing cooperatives and\ncohousing, and these are getting good press - much\nbetter than housing estates behind the gates. The fourth\nnarrative implies the fifth one, which also concerns the\ncommunity character of gated housing estates, although\nit points to the community as a tool of oppression. This\nnarrative assumes the existence of intramural commu-\nnities, but emphasizes their internal oppressive func-\ntion of social control and external function of exclusion,\nbased on a sense of elitism and the need for distinction.\n\nAt this point, the concept of social segregation\nappears, followed by yet another narrative. The phe-\nnomenon of gated communities development is called\nghettoization. The word “ghetto”, although used in\nreverse, retains its pejorative connotations. It empha-\nsizes the importance of gates, but not only in the sense\nof protection, but also compulsory enclosure, and the\nrelativism of the fences — which always have two sides.\nThis narrative presents gated communities as some-\nthing shameful, out of fashion, and out of date. It results\nnot so much from their extensive criticism as from the\npopularisation of the phenomenon. The popularity of\ngated communities has made it more difficult to buy\na new apartment in an open housing estate than ina\ngated one, but at the same time the gated community\nhas lost its ennobling and exclusive character. Besides,\nwith its coarse fences, it does not resemble the most\nfashionable places in which to live today: functionally\ndiversified residential and service complexes, typically\nembedded in the historic urban fabric. Elektrownia\nPowisle (formerly a power plant) and Centrum Praskie\nKoneser (erstwhile vodka factory) in Warsaw manifest\ntheir elitism and exclusivity in much more subtle and\ntasteful ways. The excluding factor here is, on the\n\none hand, the prohibitive price of flats, and on the other\nhand, hidden security and monitoring, which keep up\nappearances of a fashionable urban space, despite the\nfact that they offer none of the authentic urban open-\nness and diversity. In this narrative, the criticism of\ngated communities, manifested in the contemptuous\nterms of “lemmings” and “transplants”,’ is founded in\nthe same resentment on which their elitism once stood.\n\nEach of the narratives contains a different part of the\ntruth about gated communities, and points to different\nparts of the problem, so it is no wonder that subsequent\nreactions to fencing off housing estates also match only\nselected narratives and subplots.\n\nSeeking a legal solution\nThe spatial thread contains the idea of introducing local\nlandscape resolutions. Pursuant to the Act of April 24,\n2015 on the amendment of certain acts in connection\nwith the strengthening of landscape protection tools,\nlocal governments may introduce their own local land-\nscape regulations. As part of these regulations, under\nlocal law, decisions are made on advertising-free cul-\ntural parks, as well as on the prohibition of fencing off\n\n1 Compare: P.

In short: the spatial solutions proposed by\nNewman are meant to result in specific behaviours of\nthe users.\n\nOn the basis of Newman’s theory, many programs\nwere created, recommended by city planners and\npolicemen,\"* including Secured by Design - the official\nprogram of the British police, and the CPTED program\n(Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design),\nwhich comes from the United States, widely promoted\nby the international non-governmental organization\ncalled the ICA (International CPTED Association)!”. ICA\nled to the publication of the ISO standard on CPTED in\nJanuary 2021 (ISO 22341:2021). Although the American\nversion focuses on spatial issues, it also emphasizes the\nimportance of a strong local community. In the second\ngeneration of CPTED rules (the first one contained\nspatial and technical solutions, also regarding access\nlimitation), it was described, for example, how to organ-\nize a neighbourhood watch. It is difficult to shake off the\nimpression that the proposed remedy may become a\ndisease at some point. The problem was noticed, among\nothers, by Bryan Lee Jr., a black designer from New\nOrleans who deals with the concept of ‘just city’. Lee\nbelieves that security mechanisms based on neigh-\nbourly control and the assumption that any person with\nantisocial intentions should feel uncomfortable may\ncause discomfort to anyone who looks different and\ndoes not conform to normative patterns or — what is par-\nticularly important in the United States — has a different\ncoloured skin.'8 The strategy promoted by the CPTED\nthreatens to deepen the divisions between “us” and\n“them” and reinforce the not-in-my-backyard phenom-\nenon, i.e. the opposition of residents to certain invest-\nments (for example shelters for people experiencing\nhomelessness crisis, or counselling centres for people\nwith addictions) in their immediate vicinity, although\nthey do not deny that these facilities are needed.\n\nThe concept of design influencing user behaviour\ncan also lead to abuse. After all, this includes the con-\ntroversial ‘hostile design’, i.e. elements used in public\nspace that are supposed to modify human behaviour,\nfor example, prevent the homeless from lying on park\nbenches. It is difficult to precisely answer the question\nof when the applied elements help maintain security,\nand when they serve to divide and exclude.\n\nTherefore, this solution cannot be considered effec-\ntive either. Focusing on one narrative does not lead to\nobtaining answers to other narratives; worse, it provokes\nsituations that, according to subsequent narratives, may\nbe considered problematic.

New way of fencing\nwithout using a fence\n\nPhoto: Agata Twardoch\n\nAGATA TWARDOCH\n\nthe contempt for inhabitants of gated communities who\nwant luxury and distinction, can be assessed in a similar\nway. It resulted (in a manner of speaking, because we\nshould not ascribe excessive importance to that) ina\nnew wave of antagonisms and reluctance towards yet\nanother social group.\n\nDiagnosis\nTo understand the problem of gated communities with\nall its complexity, no single narrative will suffice. In med-\nicine, when a set of symptoms is not amenable to diagno-\nsis or treatment, an explanation beyond purely physical\nissues is sought. As health problems can be a symptom\nof disease not only of the body, but also of the mental\nsphere, answers are sought in the patient’s personal life,\nin his relationships with his family and childhood mem-\nories, and uncomfortable truths are discovered. Perhaps,\nin a similar way, the problems of our cities result from\nthe psychological problems of individuals and the soci-\n\nety, and gated communities are merely a veil, the effect\nof the denial syndrome that breaks to the surface while\nhiding the thing that causes the unpleasant feelings, the\nthing we subconsciously do not want to look at, that does\nnot fit into our vision of reality?\n\n \n\nAfter all, there are many things we do not want to\nlook at: places and people who will never fit into the per-\nfect image of the city straight from Jan Gehl’s books, an\ninconvenient truth that does not fit in with our collec-\ntive vision of an ideal city. Many elements hurt our eyes\nalso in the housing sphere.\n\nFirstly, the housing problem can never be fully\nresolved. It is impossible to arrange a city where there\nwill be no substandard flats, which are too small,\novercrowded, underexposed, and ugly, or a city where\neveryone will have access to the flat they need. Housing\nresources are degrading, the requirements, needs and\npossibilities of the entire society and individuals are\nchanging, so even in cities where the statistical deficit\nof housing has been eliminated, a housing policy must\nbe pursued. If we were to acknowledge that for housing,\ncrisis is a natural condition, we would cease to perceive\nhousing policy as an intervention. The housing estate\nwould become a type of infrastructure, rather than a\nsocial policy; it would cease to be perceived in terms of\ncharity or as something shameful. It would not be neces-\nsary to hide social flats on Dudziarska Street in Warsaw,\nor in metal containers on the outskirts of many cities in\nPoland.\n\nSecondly, it is impossible to solve the problem of\nhomelessness or to remove people in the homelessness\ncrisis from the urban space. Some of these people will\nnever be able to lead the life that the general public\nconsiders ‘normal’. Some will never wish to. This does\nnot mean that night shelters should be closed; on the\ncontrary — infrastructure for people experiencing a\nhomelessness crisis should be made a rightful and equal\nelement of the urban landscape. Night shelters should\nnot be situated in the worst locations, and park benches\nshould not discourage people from lying down. No wor-\nries, people will not take to sleeping in parks on a mass\nscale, the general public prefer the comfort of their beds.\n\nFinland introduced the “home first” scheme, and\nhas done so comprehensively. Within that scheme, any\nperson in a homelessness crisis can obtain assisted\nhousing, regardless of whether or not they will adapt to\narbitrary rules. At the Congress of Urban Movements\nin Katowice in 2017, Hanna Gill-Piatek emphasized that\nwithin only three years, the costs generated for the city\nby a person in a homelessness crisis exceed the cost of\nbuilding a small, basic apartment. Perhaps the Finn-\nish method would help us bring the phenomenon of\nhomelessness to the lowest possible level, and save a few\npeople from dying in the street while we're at it.\n\nThirdly, when we say that a city is its people, we\ncannot mean merely heteronormative families with two\nchildren, or middle-class members with internalized\nsocial norms. The real city is the young and the old, the\npoor and the rich, the smart and the stupid, the pretty\nand the ugly; exemplary citizens, but also troubled",
    "Page_67": "recidivists, vegans, cyclists and diesel SUV-driving\npork-knuckle eaters. The city is made up of Catholics,\nBuddhists and followers of the Flying Spaghetti Mon-\nster, classical music lovers and disco polo fans, those\nwho are pro-choice and those who are pro-life, and even\nthe residents of gated communities.\n\nFourthly, city will never be completely safe, so\ninstead of hiding our children behind a fence, let us\nteach them to minimize the risk.\n\nFifthly, not everywhere can be beautiful. Ugliness,\ndirt and mediocrity have the same or even greater right\nto the city space as cleanliness, beauty and harmony.\nPerhaps a centrally managed shopping mall can be\ntruly clean, beautiful and harmonious — but a living city\ncannot.\n\nIdo not intend to psychoanalyze the city. There are\nauthors, for example Andrzej Leder, who are better\nequipped to do that. I would like to point out that if a\ncity (which also extends to ourselves — town planners\nand residents) wishes to solve the problem of gated\ncommunities, it must — to continue the psychological\nparallel - face the truth about itself: get rid of its ideal-\nized image, and in return begin to like itself the way it is,\naccept its imperfect but merely good enough elements.\n\n65 DENIAL SYNDROME\n\nDZIECI PROSIMY\n0 ZAMYKANIE\n\n \n\nWhat we need\nWe need an inclusive city that accepts its problems and\nsolves them openly instead of being ashamed of them,\nignoring them, and finally denying their existence. We\nneed a city in which every resident, regardless of their\nstatus, gender, age, ethnic origin and any other char-\nacteristics, firstly, will find a place for themselves (in a\ngeneral sense), and secondly, will find the conditions to\nsecure a decent place to live. Citizens have the right to\nthe city, and the right to housing. They have the right\nto use the city fairly, and to participate broadly in its\ngovernance, and in housing accessibility for all. That\naccessibility should be considered already at the stage\nof ensuring the conditions for the supply of housing, i.e.\nwhen establishing the framework for the city’s develop-\nment, estimating the number and type of housing units\nneeded, designating land for their construction, and\nplanning technical and social infrastructure.\n\nIn practice, we need the percentages of flats in the\naccessible sector to be established for each area within\nthe city limits, already at the level of local law. We need\nhousing provisions through which social housing will be\ncreated next to commercial housing, indistinguishable\nfrom the outside, for example in accordance with the\nprinciples of ‘pepper potting’ (scattering social housing\n\nunits among private housing) and ‘tenure blindness’\n(meaning that from the outside, it is impossible to\ndistinguish the status of the apartment). We need to\ncoordinate the construction of new apartments with the\ninfrastructure, not only technical, but also social where\nnecessary, and the costs of that must be passed on to\nreal estate developers. We need to start treating property\nalso as an obligation, and not just as an unlimited right.\nWe need a holistic paradigm shift. If it happens, per-\nhaps gated communities will not be needed anymore.\nHowever, if any do appear, we will include them in the\nurban landscape and accept them. e\n\nVv\nWarszawa, Elektrownia Powisle\n\nfot.

When and how\ndid the mortgage loans arrive in Poland and other\npost-communist countries?\n\nMIKOLAJ LEWICKI: The arrival of mortgage\n\nloans in Poland is both a symbolic and a literal\nmarker of the transformation of the entire housing\nsystem. You can probably argue with economists and\nanalysts, but I feel strong enough to defend that state-\nment in symbolic terms. Until 1997 - when the Mortgage\nAct came out - there existed housing loans, but they\nwere granted in a different manner, mainly to housing\ncooperatives or through housing cooperatives, and\nthe loan was included in the rent of the apartment. In\nprinciple, a form of ownership appeared, but it was still\ncooperative ownership.\n\nThen came the year 1997, and the Mortgage Act was\nintroduced. For the next several years, mortgage loans\nwere not in fact visible in the socio-economic life. They\nappeared rarely, in specific forms, such as the “Alicja”\nloan at PKO BP bank, which turned out to be a total fail-\nure due to inflation and interest rates. In the years 2002-\n2003, a version of a foreign currency loan, denominated\nand indexed to a foreign currency, made its debut. This\nwas not the only form of loan available, but it turned out\nto be crucial for the future history of credit.\n\nIn the first decade of the twenty-first century, macro-\neconomic conditions changed: at the level of public\nfinances, in line with the monetary policy, we managed\nto reduce the State deficit and its liabilities, and at the\nsame time to stifle demand. Thanks to this, the zloty\nhas become a stable currency with predictable interest\nrates. We had experienced a major economic crisis and\nhigh unemployment. After the stabilization of macro-\neconomic conditions, the financial sector was willing to\noffer mortgage loans. But the story of the mortgage loan\nneeds to be related in conjunction with the changes in\nthe Polish housing system. In the 1990s and early 2000s,\nit was not clear which way the latter would go. Various\nconcepts were clashing — one was close to the German\nsystem, that is, with incentives to accumulate savings,\nand with a range of different titles to an apartment: in\naddition to ownership, there was the rental market,\nnon-commercial i.e. subsidized rent, and social housing.\nThat might have given us a chance to respond to the\nhousing needs of different groups. However, that con-\ncept competed against and ultimately lost out to another\nsystem, strongly supported at that time by USAID or the\nWorld Bank, whose agendas recommended the com-\nmodification of housing.\n\nDLR: When did the postulate of housing commodifi-\ncation first appear?\n\nML: Much earlier than in the 1990s. It was associ-\nated with the general trend of neoliberal policy,\n\nbut in Poland it came to the fore more strongly on the\n\neve of its accession to the European Union, when our\ncountry became investment-worthy. The horizon of\naccession to the European Union was important for\nthree reasons. Firstly, for the stability of the currency\nand the price of money. Secondly, for the housing\n\nissue and its resolution by the State. At that time, the\nState’s involvement in the housing system in Poland\n\n— that includes also the expenditure on housing policy —\nwas limited in order to stabilize public spending, reduce\nthe deficit, and meet the criteria expected by the Euro-\npean Union. Hungary followed a similar trend. Thirdly,\nPoland’s accession to the European Union was impor-\ntant for real estate investors. Suddenly, we have become\na market where you can invest in residential real estate.\nCommercial real estate had already been globalized and\ninternationalized previously; to this day, lease prices for\noffice space are calculated in euros and dollars.\n\nThe year 2004 was important for the housing market,\nbecause foreign investors were expected to arrive, and\nso they did. This fuelled a surge in home prices, the\nmost dynamic in the last thirty years. Even today’s gains\nare no match for it. Those who were selling or trading\napartments at the time were able to generate enormous\nprofits. The “rush code” emerged. The narrative was\ndirected at those who bought their first apartment, in\norder to live in it: do not delay buying, because housing\nprices are constantly growing. When weighing our own\ncomfort and standard of living related to income, which\nalso somehow more or less predictably grows, it was\nnecessary to take into account the fact that the more we\npostpone the purchase of an apartment, the more we\nwill have to pay for it, and the ratio between our income\nand the costs of the loan can only get worse.\n\nLet us get back to the housing system. In 1997, in\naddition to the mortgage loan, other solutions were\nintroduced, such as reforms of the housing sector, and\nexperiments with TBSs (Social Housing Associations). It\nseemed that the rental market would develop in parallel\nand become competitive to real estate ownership. This\nwas to be ensured by exemptions, various tax solutions\nthat were meant to encourage investing in rental apart-\nments in order to build the stock of those. The plan did\nnot work. All discounts and incentives for private inves-\ntors have been cut. After 2000, the effects of the tran-\nsition could already be seen (and the transition itself\nwould end at the end of the first decade of the twenty-—\nfirst century), specifically in decreasing public sector\nspending on housing, which was radically reduced in\n2009 by the liquidation of the National Housing Fund as\nan institution responsible for the State’s housing policy.\nThe share of housing in the State budget has decreased\ndrastically, which translated into the marginalization of\nsolutions that competed with purely market-oriented\nones, focusing on individual ownership and individual\ninvestment in property, i.e. primarily the mortgage loan.\n\n67 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF CREDIT\n\nThis is a story about the role of the State in the develop-\n\nment of the housing market.\n\nDLR: The last piece of the puzzle is missing, namely\n\nthe privatization of the housing stock.\n\nML: We do not fully know the scale of the transfer\nof property. I found no reliable data to show\n\nhow many apartments were ultimately privatized, no\n\nestimates of their value. O\n\n \n\nWe know one thing: the\ntransition had enormous\neconomic consequences.\nPrivate apartments appeared\non the market, they could be\nsold, they belonged to some-\none. The owners could adopt\ndifferent strategies: to sell the\napartment, to exchange it, or\nto keep it. In a social sense,\nthe privatization of the housing\nstock played an even greater\nrole: home ownership has\nbecome the norm.\n\nData from the Central Statistical Office of Poland’s\nhousehold budget surveys show that this norm did not\ncome out of nowhere. We fantasized about living in our\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nown, beautiful, spacious apartment in a new building,\nwhile at the same time rental - even market-based\n\n— began to be associated with something transitory,\nrelated to a specific stage in life, or with a life’s failure.\nThe tenants are either young people, or those whose\nsocio-demographic and financial situation is worse than\nthat of apartment owners.\n\nTo sum up: three macro-processes — changes in the\nfinancial sector regarding the zloty and macroeconomic\nstability, the related change in the State’s housing policy,\nand privatization — led to the situation where the mort-\ngage loan, although it had appeared legally and insti-\ntutionally back in 1997, only started to play a major role\nfrom the beginning of the twenty-first century. In the\nyears 2008-2009, the mortgage credit was already the\nmain actor in the boom in the housing market in Poland,\nand then in the history of Swiss-franc debtors, emblem-\natic of what was happening with mortgage loans. Then\nmortgage became naturalized; from the second decade\nof the twenty-first century onwards, it has entered the\nhorizon of thinking about the future for the majority of\nyoung Poles who are becoming independent, starting a",
    "Page_70": "family, and looking for a place to live. Young Poles know\nthat a mortgage is practically the only way to acquire an\napartment of one’s own, unless you inherit or expect to\ninherit a flat.\n\nIn Poland and in Slovakia, unlike in the other two\nVisegrad countries, there is an intergenerational trans-\nfer of housing, and inheritance is gaining importance\nas a way to obtain your own apartment. In Hungary\nand the Czech Republic, it is the norm - or rather a\nsocial necessity — to buy a flat. The Polish market is not\nmoving towards the market of active investors who trade\nin apartments like on the Anglo-Saxon market. We are\nheading towards polarization: some will indeed enter\nthis kind of business, but at the same time we will see\nthe growing number of people waiting for a flat in the\nfamily stock to become vacant, similar to Italy. The latter\nmethod of obtaining a place to live has already become\nrelatively popular in Poland. In the population of\nhouseholds, some 10-15 per cent of their representatives\nfrom younger age cohorts report the so-called free use.\nThey do not formally pay for the apartment they occupy,\nmeaning that they live in it thanks to family relations.\nAnother dozen or so per cent hope that they will one day\ninherit an apartment. The process of marketization of\nthe housing sector does not have to end with a flourish-\ning society of speculators. It may well be based on the\ntransfer of property within the family.\n\nDLR: In the People’s Republic of Poland, there was a\n\nconviction that an apartment was one’s due\n(although one had to wait for it for a long time). How did\nit happen that we stopped seeing housing as our right,\nand began to perceive it as acommodity, and then as a\nfinancial instrument?\nML: Let me indulge in an intellectual exercise\n\nhere, because this process is yet to be investi-\ngated. I’m under the impression that an apartment as\ncommodity is currently legitimized in the discourse.\nThe younger generation are aware that their parents got\ntheir flats for free or bought them at low cost, therefore,\nit had been much easier for them. Now the apartment\ncan be bought or inherited. In terms of buying, there is\na growing challenge, as the actual relationship between\nthe earnings and the prices of flats is becoming increas-\ningly unfavourable for buyers. In subjective experience,\nthis means that since I cannot afford an apartment, I\nsimply have to recognize that I must wait for something\nto become available within the family resource. Such\nan apartment will not be a commodity; it will be an\ninheritance - or an inherited property. The above cir-\ncumstances lead us towards a social order based on the\npatrimonial principle. The decision by the head\nof the family - about who inherits what — is of primary\nimportance. Scholars who study this area and deal with\nthe housing sector also write that we are already seeing a\ntrend towards developing a sort of a patrimonial system.\n\nTherefore, family ties will certainly be broader, and\npeople will try to control them.\n\nThis behaviour is in opposition to the belief that\nthere is a continuous and dynamic process of individ-\nualization, meaning that each of us wants to become\nindependent as soon as possible. It seems that the\nimportance of family ties in Polish society will continue\nto grow. We have two Polands: one tries to individualize,\nbecome independent, go on its own; and the other is\nunable to do so, it lives by the hope of inheritance.\n\nDLR: You write a lot in your book about the impor-\ntance of family ties also among people who decide to\ntake out a loan. You have devoted much space to the\nfamily’s support in raising one’s own contribution to\nthe loan, taking care of one’s children, or financial\nassistance in purchasing furniture. About the title of\nyour book The Social Life of a Mortgage” — I'd like to ask\nyou, to which extent is the mortgage experience a social\nexperience? How does it affect society? What group of\nPoles does it concern?\n\nML: It must be clearly spelled out that the percent-\nage of credit recipients is not that high - and if\nwe were to stick to the data, it would be difficult to claim\nthat mortgage is important for the entire housing pro-\nduction and distribution system. In 2018, in a representa-\ntive survey by Eurostat, 11.7% of households declared that\nthey were recipients of a mortgage loan. In this respect\nwe are far behind Spain, where every second household\nis repaying such a loan. Two things must be taken into\naccount: the increasing number of credit recipients, and\nthe lack of alternative forms of title to an apartment,\nincluding a rental contract. The Platforma Obywatelska\n(Civic platform party) government towards the end of\ntheir term in office, too late realized the necessity for\nthe existence of home rental market. After the financial\nrecession, it was already made clear that mortgage loans\nalone would not solve the housing problem - but now the\nsecond decade of the twenty-first century was coming to\nan end, and no programs had been launched that would\nhave given the rental market a strong boost. The lack of\nalternatives means that the credit market has been grow-\ning dynamically all the time. O\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA study by Marta Olcon-Kubicka and Mateusz\nHalawa - systematic research, albeit not yet covering\nthe entire population - shows that there has been a\nnormativisation, related not only to those who take out\na mortgage. The wedding custom of gifting the bride\nand groom an envelope with money towards their own\ncontribution is a certain social norm. One of the reasons\nthat people get married and put on a wedding is because\nalong with the ceremony, there comes a chance to col-\nlect money for their own contribution towards the loan,\ncreating conditions in the family circle that will support\nendeavouring to acquire property.\n\nDLR: You are writing about household debt in your\nbook. How would you explain what it is,\nexactly, in the context of the configuration of global\ncapitalism?\nML: Research shows a steady trend in household\ndebt. It did not arrive with the transition and\nthe advent of neoliberalism; it had started earlier, but we\nonly now understood its nature. The banks’ portfolios\nshow that the value of loans to individual households is\ngrowing proportionally to the loans granted to entre-\npreneurs. In the global trend, household debt begins to\naffect the configuration of the financial sector. Banks\nare slowly ceasing to be the resource and the player that\ndevelops the production sector, and their customers\nare individual households who are not so much saving\nmoney, but getting into debt. We must remember that\nhousehold debt is integrated into institutional systems.\nFor instance, the debt of the entire Dutch society, which\nis higher than the country’s GDP, does not mean that\nthe poor, indebted society must take out loans in large\namounts. Note that households are getting into debt\nbecause they are encouraged to invest in the market.\nThis phenomenon has been typical of the last twenty\nyears; Poland and the countries of Central and Eastern\nEurope have become part of it, and the political and\neconomic transition in the region has coincided with\nthe dynamics of this process. The most emblematic\nexamples of this tendency are the stories of Ireland\nand Spain, the two countries that have modernized\nthemselves thanks to EU accession and globalization.\n\nThe second issue concerns the normative level: the own-\nership of a flat is evidence of social status, of the fact\n\nthat we have a predictable life trajectory — no longer as individu-\nals but as families. Loans for home purchase in Poland are mainly\ntaken out by couples, and so people burdened with credit are\nsending a signal to the society about what stage of life they are\nat, and what their plans are for the future. In this sense, the mort-\n\ngage radiates much wider.\n\n68 CONVERSATION WITH MIKOEAJ LEWICKI",
    "Page_71": "Modernisation was coupled with financialisation, and\nthe development of those countries largely resulted\nfrom the relationship between the financial sector and\nthe housing sector. Homes have become “high-quality\ncollateral”. Housing investments, in addition to meet-\ning the housing needs of the Spaniards and the Irish,\nsecured the capital needed to generate capital in the\nfinancial markets. Apartments are needed to dynam-\nically develop financial market instruments that have\nnothing to do with housing, or borrowing for housing\npurposes. This changes the logic of the relationship\nbetween supply and demand.\n\nWhen we think about why mortgage credit market\ngrows, we usually primarily consider housing needs.\nPeople have to satisfy these needs somehow, so they buy\napartments on the market. We wish they had another\nchoice, another option. The situation in Spain and\nIreland was different in the way that they already had\na developed and privatized housing stock. Agents and\nfinancial brokers would accost ordinary people, and use\nhard-sell techniques to peddle credits. They presented\nloans as a unique opportunity, cheap money, a great\ninvestment, and a way to earn money. They did this\nbecause banks needed the security of these forms of\ncapital.\nDLR:\nated...O\n\nSo some kind of fictional narrative was cre-\n\n \n\nML:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfrom the financial sector where investors earn serious\nmoney. They are prepared for that, they know the risks,\nand so they protect themselves. It wasn’t until 1980s in\nthe United States, and then in Europe in the process of\nmarket integration (primarily financial markets), that\nthe idea of linking the two was conceived — because it\nwould facilitate the creation of instruments involving\nmortgage loans for individual people — a specific Span-\niard who wished to buy an apartment to move in, or to\ninvest — with an investor in Wall Street or in Madrid who\nintended to speculate. The combination of these two\ncreated an explosive mixture - or rather, a narcotic drug\n— and now it is difficult to back away from it.\n\nDLR: It caused the crisis of 2008, and yet the system\npersists...\nML: Nothing extraordinary happened within that\n\nsystem. We can expect that since Poland - a\ncountry in Central and Eastern Europe — has already\nbecome globalized, it will also be involved in the pro-\ncess. Poland’s situation is slightly different from that\nin the Western European countries that I mentioned\nearlier: we do not have surplus capital here, meaning\nthat agents are not looking for potential credit recipi-\nents to generate more capital. In Poland, banks grant\nmortgage loans because they earn their rates of return as\nwell as the interest rate they charge on the loan. The real\nestate market is not liquid enough. There is a shortage\n\nThe idea was to find credit recipients who would\nhedge more important and more profitable financial\n\ninstruments. That is why no one thought much about the terms of\nmortgage loans, or analyse whether they were safe, whether they\nmet the actual needs, whether the construction of housing made\n\nsense. At some point, it all ceased to matter.\n\nThe whole phenomenon of “ghost cities” in Spain and\nempty quarters in large towns of Ireland is due to that\nrush, that bandwagon. Construction was not about pro-\nviding saleable and attractive flats. Instead, flats were\nbuilt as a collateral against more substantial capital.\n\nDLR: Why is an apartment a good collateral for the\nbank?\nML: Banks assume that the value of an apartment\n\nwill always grow. The apartment has a mate-\nrial aspect, i.e. it is inalienable. There will be tenants.\nAlso, we need to remember that - contrary to what\nmight seem - the financial market operates according\nto stereotypes, representations, and fantasies. Inves-\ntors are guided not only by numbers, but also by beliefs\nand intuitions. Hence the speculative manias. For a\nlong time, the political and economic system followed\none simple rule: let us separate ordinary people, with\ntheir ordinary needs and the pursuit of their fulfilment,\n\nof properties that change hands quickly, so the market\nis not attractive enough for the type of operations that\nhave been conducted in Spain.\nDLR: Does this mean that the “wall of money” does\nnot work in our country? You wrote about this —\nlet us explain what it is.\nML: In Poland, the “wall of money” does not work\nin the same way as in the aforementioned West-\nern countries. The basic problem of the global financial\nsector is capital surplus, meaning that it has a lot of\nmoney generated by successive financial operations,\nand is looking for new sources of profit. Inevitably, these\nsources are increasingly risky — after all, how many\noptions are there to invest in a predictable way, with a\ngood rate of return? And rates of return must be pre-\nserved. Consequently, risky investments are secured by\nfinancial products that appear to be more secure - such\nas the promise of future, consistent mortgage payments.\n\n69 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF CREDIT\n\nOn the other hand, progressively more risky invest-\nments are being sought. For an investment banker, the\n“wall of money” means that although he may have safe\ninvestments in his portfolio, they will not achieve his\nprimary goal of increasing the rate of return, or at least\nmaintaining it at the current level. Surplus money has\nto be employed somehow. During the financial crisis, it\nwas transferred to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe search for new sources of profit gave the main\nimpetus to increase the share of mortgage lending in\nthe region. We are talking about the years 2004-2008,\nbut it continued beyond that period, only with different\ndynamics. Banks withdrew loans partially due\nto the recession and its effects. For example, in Hungary,\nthe financial crisis had much greater repercussions, it\nturned into a social crisis, both due to the effects of the\neconomic collapse, the crash of the financial sector, the\ncollapse of investments, and also in the aspect of mort-\ngage loans denominated in foreign currencies. Hungary\n— and Croatia as well - incurred more severe social costs\nof credit loans than Poland did.\n\nAfter 2008, it quickly turned out that mortgage loans,\nespecially those denominated and indexed to a foreign\ncurrency, known as “foreign currency loans”, are simply\na dangerous tool. Because of them, there is a growing\ngroup of people who have already gone bankrupt or\nmay soon go bankrupt. As a result, there is a growing\npressure to do something about these loans, or to call\nthem by a different name, institutional and financial\nregulations notwithstanding. In Hungary and in Croatia\nthere has been a shift transforming the importance of\nthe mortgage loan. Orban called the banking sector the\n“foreign capital”, and announced a payback for driving\nso many Hungarians to the brink of bankruptcy, or\nto the actual bankruptcy and losing their homes. He got\nthe State and the public sector involved in solving the\nproblem, but shifted part of the costs of resolving the\nSwiss franc issue to global banking networks. In Croatia,\non the other hand, a strong consumer movement has led\nto a turning point in court proceedings. O\n\n \n\nIn Poland, we have not\nexperienced a transfor-\nmation of the significance of a\nmortgage loan. It is still socially\nlegitimate — implying that it is\nconsidered the main, even the\nonly way of obtaining property.\nTrue enough, we know the his-\ntory of Swiss franc debtors, but",
    "Page_72": "frankly, it is not teeming with\nsocial drama. Instead, it illus-\ntrates the risks involved. It tells\nus: “you are entering dangerous\nground”, rather than “someone\nhas done us harm”.\n\nThe Swiss franc credit recipients are constantly trying\nto be heard in the public sphere, so far unsuccessfully. I\nbelieve that the problem has become “juridized”, that is,\nthe claims were transferred from the political sphere - in\nwhich we say: “banks acted dishonestly” (the categories\nof justice and injustice can be seen in Orban’s discourse)\n— to the sphere of courts and lawyers, decided case by\ncase. Orban took advantage of the topic politically, but\nhe also politicized the whole problem, theoretically\nfinancial and economic one; he said that it was unfair,\nand the relationship with the banks had to be changed.\nSociety in Poland does not wonder: something has hap-\npened here, there is a large social group involved, and\nwe cannot lay all the blame on these people. We let it\nslide, in a similar way as we let the re-privatization slide.\n\nDLR: What are the social and spatial consequences of\nmortgage credit? How is space created as a result?\n\nML: Researchers dealing with urbanization agree\nthat without the mortgage credit, we would not have\nexperienced the same dynamic suburbanization as the\nlast two decades had seen. The faster the prices and the\ndemand in the housing market grow, the greater the\ntendency towards suburbanization. Flats are becoming\nmore expensive, especially in city centres, and so are\nloans - therefore, we settle further from the centre, in\nworse locations. This is quite an obvious correlation. I’m\ntalking about big cities. The situation is a bit different in\nlesser towns, where the market is smaller, the prices are\nnot so high, and there is more space. It is a simple deriv-\native of the land value and investment opportunities of\nindividual credit recipients. Few people can afford to\nlive in the city centre. Increasingly luxurious investment\nprojects are being built there, which are often the sub-\nject of speculation, in other words, real estate trade.\n\nLet us start getting used to the sight of vacant build-\nings and flats; indeed, they will be more common in the\ncity centre than on the outskirts. Flats purchased for\ninvestment purposes, for long-term or short-term rental\nwill fall victim to that phenomenon. In Warsaw, more\nthan half of the apartments are bought with cash, and\nthis is while the prices are rising. It is not some money\npulled out of a mattress. The buyers pulled the money\nout of their previous investment in an apartment, and\nput it into a new one. There is even a name for such\n\nmanoeuvres: flipping. Small entre-\n\npreneurs speculate in the housing\n\nmarket in the short term, and they are among the drivers\nof prices. They are crowding out those who want to buy\na flat to live in and start a family. The latter are left with\nlower standard housing outside the city centre. The\ncities are developing extensively.\n\nAlong with the dynamic suburbanization, there\ngrows a heterogeneous, less valued space, burdened\nwith higher risk from the developers’ point of view. Indi-\nvidual, small developers are starting to dominate within\nit. This is an important signal for all architects and town\nplanners. Suburbanization is not about purchasing large\ntracts of land by large investors who decide to build a\nlarge-scale housing estate near the city and we cannot\nassume that what they build will be a logical, rational\nurban or suburban structure, with a high degree of\ndensity, but relatively comfortable. Comfort-related\nrequirements are growing: people want apartments,\nplus a gym, and a space for themselves. Large real estate\ndevelopers take this into account at the planning stage,\nbut in the suburbs, that is in the areas with the highest\ndynamics, small-scale concerns tend to dominate. The\natter work in the short term; they wish to build and\nto sell right away. They do not need to create a brand.\nThere are so many suburban areas that if the investment\nproject does not work out in one part of the city, they\ncan simply move to another part. The implications are\nsimple: a standard of housing that is not too high, fairly\now expectations as to the integration and blending of\nthe project into the surroundings, shifting costs onto the\n‘uture tenants — because this is about short-term profit.\nYes, the fault lies with the developers, but also with the\nocal authorities. The latter encouraged people to settle\nin suburban municipalities, because they wanted more\ntax revenues, and they did not care much about the\nurban composition.\n\nThe process will continue. Growing expectations\nof the residents mean that the market may become\na bit more civilized, that is to say, investments of a\nhigher standard will be created, but it is not a given.\nInvestors do not think in terms of creating an urban\nfabric, which is best demonstrated by the notorious\ngates and fences. I think the developer uses them to\nclearly show the residents how far his power extends.\nThis generates the kind of urban composition that\ntriggers conflict. Inevitably, in this chaos, functionally\ndivergent spaces arise, and the people who live there\nhave to deal with that somehow.\n\nDLR: Ultimately, they self-organize in their own\nways. You studied these processes with Joanna\nKusiak in the context of the development of Biatoteka.\nNow I would like to address the social function of credit,\nits contribution to creating social stratification and\ndistinction. In your book, you invoke Pierre Bourdieu’s\nphrase: the “choice of the necessary”. Mainstream media\nhave been feeding us beautiful stories about choosing\n\n \n\nCONVERSATION WITH MIKOEAJ LEWICKI\n\nan apartment, and then furnishing it according to our\nstatus or our aspirations. It is only hard data - or the\nvery fact of the mortgage - that reveals to what extent\nthe housing situation is determined by creditworthiness\nor the lack thereof.\nML: “Choice of the necessary” was coined to\ndescribe the basic experience of the lower class.\n\nOf course, Pierre Bourdieu created an oxymoron. While\nwe experience something as an option, we are actually\ndeprived of any choice. In theory, we can buy an apart-\nment or not buy it. We can do it with someone, or we can\ndo it on our own. We can buy a cheaper or a smaller flat.\nWe ourselves decide whether we include another room\nfor a child, although this will cost us more, or whether\nwe stick with a safe option, just one room and a kitchen.\nPeople rarely notice that their choices are embedded in\na certain logic that led them to the fact that, for exam-\nple, they do not think of long-term rental as a viable\noption for an extended period of time. The dimension\nof aspirations is important in this context. The market\nof apartments for rent offers a low level of security and\ncomfort of living. Rental dominates: it is expensive,\nmainly due to limited supply, therefore it does not\npresent an attractive alternative to ownership; also, its\nconditions are mostly determined by the landlord.\nAs flats to rent are in short supply on the market, own-\nership remains the only option, while rental is a tempo-\nrary condition. And so: the waiter hands you the menu,\nyou are hungry, but you can only choose salad. Sure,\nthere are various ingredients to choose from, but you\ncannot order any other dish.\n\nSo far, our career opportunities, and thus our social\nand economic status, our social position and our earn-\nings, have been determined by our profession. O\n\n| believe that a second\norder is growing around\nus, in which housing becomes\nas important a resource as the\nprofession. Consequently, a\nmortgage is used as the pri-\nmary leverage that allows us\nto possibly climb higher up the\nladder, and therefore the func-\ntioning of the mortgage market\nis of paramount importance.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSociology used to believe that one’s profession was a\nderivative of how the market develops. Today we could\nsay that credit places you in a specific class division.",
    "Page_73": "If you manage to buy a good flat cheaply, in a good\nlocation, and at the same time you get attractive credit\nconditions, then you are a winner on the market. We\nknow from research that apartments in the suburbs are\nusually bought by those who were not able to afford\nbuying one in the centre, and furthermore they had low\ncreditworthiness, so they had to pay more for the loan.\nThese people are therefore potentially the most exposed\nto a possible turmoil resulting from the change in the\nstatus of their property (as its value may decrease), and\nif their source of income is unstable, they may find it\ndifficult to repay the loan.\nDLR: Added to this is the role of the State in creat-\ning housing policy. In the post-transition\nperiod, the State supported the activities of developers\nand banks through the so-called housing programs.\nML: This logic is striking in its simplicity. In 2009,\nthe boom on the housing market ended, as the\navailability of mortgage loans denominated in foreign\ncurrencies was declining, and ultimately reduced. At\nthat time, the government program was gaining pace,\ncalled “Rodzina na Swoim” [Family in their own home],\nwhich de facto consisted in subsidising loans to support\nindividual investments in home ownership. A similar\nprogram, “Mieszkanie dla mtodych” [Flat for the young],\ncontinued regardless of changes in the government.\nSome will say that we have a consensus on the housing\nissue, in that it is increasingly market-oriented, while\nothers will complain: we submitted to powerlessness.\nThe State cannot solve the problem, although we know\nthat with private property alone it is impossible to meet\nthe housing needs of Polish people.\n\nRecently, I have been thinking about the housing\nissue in a demographic context. The population was\nshrinking rapidly even before the pandemic. When was\nPolish demography in the black? This was immediately\nafter the boom on the housing market in the 1980s.\nTowards the end of the 1970s, the People’s Republic of\nPoland produced two hundred and twenty thousand\nflats per year. We remember that these were substandard\nflats (and we still find the “Alternatywy 4” comedy TV\nseries funny today), but they were also more accessible.\nSoon after, there was a demographic boom. It allowed us\nto enter the transition with an important resource pool:\nof people entering the labour market. Currently, in the\nstudies among young Poles, we can find declarations\nabout attachment to family values, and I would read\nthem not only in the context of fantasies about creat-\ning a wonderful family, but also in the context of the\nresources that the family brings with it. The respond-\nents also report that what they need the most is housing.\nWe can already see how dramatic this problem can be.\n\nThere is a danger that we will follow the Spanish sce-\n\nnario. In Spain, private property was not\n\nfirmly rooted - but at one point the State,\n\nruled by the dictator Franco, figured out how to prom-\nise the people that they would become “a better sort”.\nHe turned to tenant-owned housing, in order to make\nowners out of workers. The same process in Poland was\ninitiated by the privatization of apartments. Spain was\nfinancialised: the society of landlords then entered the\nglobal financial circuit, and in a short time we had five\nhundred thousand “sidewalk” evictions. The situation\nin Poland may evolve in a similar direction. The other\ndimension of the class question is social reproduction.\nClearly, at some point in their lives, young people face a\nbarrier that makes them postpone the decision to start\na family until they feel secure enough. Recently, I have\nnoticed that people who think about housing also think\nabout retirement. When the pension system collapses, it\nis only one’s own apartment that will provide financial\ncomfort and security in the old age. This raises ques-\ntions about other elements of the welfare state.\nDLR: The stories about the relationship between the\nfinancial markets and the individual fates of\nthe people in Central Europe inevitably lead to the\nconclusion that the new system, colloquially speaking,\nis evil. Empty housing shells are created in city cen-\ntres under the guise of building actual housing, while\npeople are being pushed out into a hostile environment.\nOverzealous pouring of concrete, pathological real\nestate development. In my observation, the housing\nestates of the last decade are even more optimized in\nterms of profit; now developers only think in terms of\nExcel sheets. Is it possible to somehow unscrew the tight\nneoliberal system, to explore alternative paths?\nML: I want to make it clear that Iam not demoniz-\ning the mortgage as a certain solution, which\nprovides people with a home of their own. The point\nis that it should have its place within the institutional\nsystem - rather than being the only option, with no\nalternatives.\nDLR: Is the operation of financial markets and the\ntreatment of housing as a resource for the\nproduction of financial instruments not equally prob-\nlematic?\nML: Although there is a lot of talk about how\ndysfunctional this relationship is, at the same\ntime both particular interests and the above-mentioned\nideologies, coupled with the relative weakness of nation-\nstates, mean that criticism does not lead to actual\nchange. Joe Biden and Barack Obama purportedly said\nthat the financial sector is terrible and that they wanted\nto do something about it, but nothing has happened.\nBefore financialisation, there was a ban on combining\ninvestments in the financial market with the capital of\nindividual bank customers, including credit recipients.\nNobody brought back that restriction.\nWe will not change this. We can exert social pressure\ntowards better living standards, but again we will run\n\nTHE SOCIAL LIFE OF CREDIT\n\ninto a big problem. I can imagine a reformed order at the\nlocal level — that is, increasingly better organised cities.\nIcan imagine regulations that will reduce the amount of\n“wild”, uncontrolled urbanization.\n\nThere is a growing group of people who are aware that\nquality of life does not end with one’s own apartment and\nthe fence around one’s own property or neighbourhood.\nThe number of aware citizens holding local governments\naccountable and making demands will grow - so far, I\nam observing that in particular districts of Warsaw — but\nthis does not mean that their demands will translate into\ndemands towards the State as a national organism. I do\nnot feel particularly optimistic. I believe that such big\nchanges only happen as a result of crisis events. We will\nprobably start to think differently about housing and\nlease under the influence of the coronavirus pandemic.\nSome time soon we will witness the bankruptcies of\nspeculators on the housing market, we will see how many\napartments remain vacant in the middle of the city.\n\nAt the same time, I am under no illusion that this\ncrisis can improve the lot of young people. Researchers\nneed to look at a broader context. Currently, protests of\nyoung people, organized for various reasons, are consid-\nered separately, case by case. At the discourse level, we\ndo not see any connection between the protests of young\nentrepreneurs and the Women’s Strike. Meanwhile, in\nthe experience of individuals, they all blend in with the\nquestion of life opportunities, next to the mortgage and\nthe housing issue. I see the multitude of movements in\nwhich young people engage as part of a certain social\nprocess, although I do not believe that the State or the\npoliticians will begin to change the system and to make\nit rational. PiS failed to launch the housing agenda as a\nrental program. This shows that even if someone comes\nwith meaningful program ideas and makes the first\nmoves: passing legal acts, establishing new institutions,\nat some point they end up running out of steam.\n\nDLR: Can the slogan and the belief that housing is a\nright, and not a commodity reappear in public\ndiscourse? Do you see an opportunity for such discus-\nsion and such values to break through to the main-\nstream media?\nML: The importance of the mainstream is decreas-\ning.

    "Page_75": "When housing loses its status as a right, and becomes\n\na commodity, this entails a number of changes, going\nbeyond legal and financial considerations. On the archi-\ntectural scale, the investment function leaves its mark\non the size of flats, their layout, natural light exposure,\nand quality standard of equipment. On the urban scale,\nthe way of shaping the housing estates is changing, as\nwell as the scenarios of their use and purpose. When\nbuildings constructed as apartment blocks cease to meet\nhousing standards, and investment properties do not\neven offer registration of residence, the real and tangible\ndimension of real estate investment becomes appar-\nent. Hundreds of substandard properties create junk\nspace that will be difficult to adapt to other purposes.\nThese types of investments bring a higher rate of return\nthan the most popular deposits or bonds, but they also\nadversely change the landscape and the functioning of\ncities, generating a gigantic carbon footprint and future\nmaintenance costs.\n\nThe market of apartments for sale\nThe housing market has not experienced a slowdown\nin the difficult pandemic period.! Units intended for\nsale are becoming more expensive despite the existing\nrestrictions and temporary limitations on granting\nmortgage loans. According to Eurostat data, housing\nprices in Poland are still the fastest growing of the\nentire European Union - in the period from the end of\n2019 to the third quarter of 2020, their prices increased\nby almost 8 per cent. On the one hand, this is due to\nlow interest rates and the outflow of cash from bank\ndeposits. Mortgage loans are currently the cheapest in\nthe history of the Third Republic of Poland - on average\nthey dropped from 4.39 per cent down to 2.95 per cent,\nwhich translates into hundreds of zloty worth savings\non each instalment. Unlike the growth of housing prices\nexperienced throughout the EU, the reduction of loan\ncosts is a phenomenon that is specific to Poland.\n\nOn the other hand, it would not be profitable or fea-\nsible to maintain growing sales if not for the long-term\ntrends in the Polish housing market. The postulates of\nthe right to housing and universal access to the insti-\ntutional rental market invariably remain unfulfilled.\nNegative phenomena are exacerbated by the prolifera-\ntion of non-residential investment properties, replacing\nsmaller flats and studios in the portfolio of real estate\ndevelopment investments.\n\nThe market of rental housing\nThe situation on the rental housing market is quite\ndifferent. The outflow of temporary workers, students,\nand tourists meant that the vacancy rate in large cities\nreached 12 per cent.? Only in Warsaw, this translates\ninto ten thousand units. At the same time, Eurostat data\nshow that almost every third tenant in Poland lives in\n\nan overcrowded apartment - this result is three times\nworse than the EU average.’ Unfortunately, the insta-\nbility of private rental, and the spectre of a comeback to\nhigh pre-pandemic prices mean that the recent reduc-\ntions are unlikely to bring about any improvement in\nthe quality of living spaces. Many of the units offered\nfor rent fulfil the overcrowding criteria adopted by\nEurostat.4\n\nA non-overcrowded flat is one in which a couple\nof household members, or a single person over the\nage of eighteen, have at least one room (bedroom) at\ntheir disposal. A room for children of the same gender\nshould not accommodate more than two people, and\nif they are of different gender, then each child should\nhave their own room. Such conditions are not met by\nthe micro-studios and micro-apartments, which are\nmass-produced at present. Also in larger, two-room\napartments, it is often impossible to provide a sepa-\nrate room for the child, the caregivers’ bedroom, anda\ncommon living space.

For the most part, they concerned residential\nbuildings and their immediate surroundings. Real estate\ndevelopers restricted the area of their interest (and their\ninvestment) as much as possible, which was dictated\nby cost minimization. Thus, the real estate fairs were\noverwhelmed by visualizations of apartment buildings\ndrowning in greenery, which in reality were part of a\nhousing estate without social infrastructure, or some-\ntimes merely a stand-alone block of flats, which had a\nsolely residential function.\n\nMore of the same thing\nFlats are mainly shaped by ratios and regulations\ndetermining the minimum natural light exposure,\ndistances, or biologically active surfaces.

Mere details\nseparate the apartment from the People’s Republic of\nPoland era from its successor, product of real estate\ndevelopers. Over time, the depth of the apartment’s\ncommunication route increased; therefore the area\nwith direct exposure to natural light has decreased.\nThe shape of the apartment has evolved from a square\ntowards an increasingly elongated rectangle with a\nshorter outer wall - the only one where the windows\ncan be placed. Balconies and loggias have been added to\nthe regular standard. Corner windows are also growing\nin popularity, despite the fact that they are bending\nthe rules of daylight analysis.

Real estate develop-\ners began to build housing estates with mixed func-\ntions, often advertised as small (“intimate”) residential\ndistricts or “little towns”, where the housing function\nis complemented by local services, private educational\ninstitutions, and network health clinics. There is still\nlittle room left for common spaces. Although you\ncannot see the fences, or their number has significantly\ndecreased, in such estates you will hardly ever come\nacross a public park, a kindergarten or a nursery run by\nlocal government.\n\nA spectacular example of a large housing estate\nerected by just one developer is Wilno Estate in War-\nsaw. The investment project by Dom Development on\nthe outskirts of Targowek has its own train station and\nacentral square. Several thousand people are going to\nlive in the estate designed by HRA Architekci. Although\nthe urban plan, the quarters, and the road layout were\nadapted to the local spatial development plan that is\ncurrently in force, the city planners gave the company\nalmost a free hand in shaping the development. No\nroads or public spaces were designated, and only basic\nindicators of height, floor area ratio, and biologically\nactive surface have been assigned. Marketing descrip-\ntions and press statements by both the investor and the\narchitects focus on common spaces and the individual-\nization of similar blocks of flats through murals. There\nare no mentions whatsoever of schools or kindergartens.\nThe entire Elsner estate, within which Wilno Estate is\nbeing built, does not have a single primary school. The\nincrease in the number of children between 2010 and\n2017 here was 1,592 per cent. This is the highest rate in\nthe capital, among other things, undoubtedly caused by\nthe construction of Wilno Estate. Translated into num-\nbers, this means the arrival of three hundred and fifty\nchildren up to the age of four. The data only includes the\npersons with registered residence, so it can be assumed\nthat the figures are significantly underestimated. In\n2018, 1,622 people were registered residents at the estate,\nwhereas according to the developer’s company, Wilno\nEstate already counts five thousand residents.\n\nSuburban estates are associated with mediocre\narchitectural standards and long commute time, and\nyet they remain in the investment portfolios of all major\ndevelopers, despite the fact that in recent years the\nlatter have entered the premium investment market\n\nii\n\nA\nA\n\neee\n\n \n\n— targeted at more affluent clients and investors in city\ncentres. These projects are often advertised as being\npart of the revitalization of post-industrial neighbour-\nhoods.

Because they\npresent a higher standard of common spaces, and create\nsemi-public squares and plazas open to outsiders, as\nwell as better quality architecture, they win favour with\nurban activists, authorities, and trade journals. At the\nsame time, the controversy related to the obvious gentri-\nfication effect of this type of enterprises, which was still\nbeing discussed as recently as a decade ago, now all but\ndisappeared from the press and public debate.\n\nTrojan horse\nIt is hard to shake the impression that investors make\nexcellent use of the narratives built by city activists\nagainst their creators.

    "Page_79": "movements) for the Towarowa 22 project would be\n\nhard to explain.? The design, commissioned by Echo\nInvestment, was created in the BIG architectural studio.\nThe previous version presented by the investor met\nwith fierce criticism, mainly due to the huge shopping\ncentre it proposed, passageways covered with glass roofs\ninstead of streets, and high density of built environ-\nment. In fact, BIG studio replicated all these premises,\nbut dressed them in showy architecture and covered\nthem with hundreds of trees in a rooftop park, and the\npresentation was delivered by a renowned architect.\nThese tricks have radically changed the perception of\nthe proposed investment. City representatives praise\n\nthe developer for introducing addi-\n\ntional green areas and new functions\n\nNON-HOUSING\n\ncompared to the previous project — in addition to the\nshopping centre, provisions were made for hotels and\na relatively small residential building. The question\n\nis whether the investors, who are not bound by the\nprovisions of the Local Development Plan (that has\nbeen in the works since 2004), will actually see these\nintentions through. Even if they do, the green-roofed\nbehemoth will remain but a huge commercial mall. As\nmuch as half of the area of the complex — 110 thousand\nsquare meters — has been earmarked for retail. Put this\nalongside 30 thousand square meters of offices and 15\nthousand square meters of living space, and we get the\nproof of the developer’s real intent. The size of retail\nspace will match that of the largest shopping centre in\nWarsaw, the Arkadia.!°\n\nNon-housing product\nSometimes it is difficult to assign the investment area\nto its function.

The popularity of the so-called\n“aparthotels”, which cannot be assigned either to the\nhousing category or to the service (hotel) category,\nresults from the leeway for bending local plans to the\ninvestor’s needs. Local governments are bound by\nministerial interpretations, which do not offer simple\ndefinitions or guidelines.\" They put local governments\nunder obligation to come up with analyses and inter-\npretations, which, unfortunately, are easy to question\nor undermine.

All these constitute circumstantial\nevidence, failing to provide a solid basis for making\ndecisions against the investor’s interests.\n\nThe legal situation of the units, which are located\nin residential buildings, but fail to meet the housing\nstandards, is somewhat simpler.

They can be offered for short-term rental,\nconverted into offices, but they can also remain empty,\nand serve merely as a tool of speculation.

Construction according to the design\nby Studio B.A.U. The press hailed it as “Polish Hong\nKong”. It is terrifying with its height (ninety-three\nmeters!) combined with the extreme density of built\nenvironment and small distances between the buildings.\nInside, 380 commercial units and one thousand apart-\nments have been planned, including 18-square-meter\n“investment mini-apartments” at fifteen thousand zlo-\ntys per square meter. Such shaping of the estate’s space\nwas possible, among other things, due to the fact that\nnon-residential investment properties were designed in\nthe most shaded areas.\n\nIn response to media interest, Jozef Wojciechowski,\nchairman of the supervisory board of J.W. Construction\nHolding SA, published a letter in which he presented\nhis perspective on the project that is gaining rather bad\nreputation.” From the developer’s statement, we learn\nthat the investment responds to market demand, and\nmeets the expectations of young people. According",
    "Page_81": "to Wojciechowski, many young people choose to live\n\nin smaller, often rented apartments due to the need\n\nfor mobility and comfort, and the proximity to work.\n“The developer cannot be indifferent to these needs;\nhe adapts to the market situation, and builds both very\nsmall and very large apartments.” Another reason why\ninvestors target small apartments is that for years now,\nthe latter have been the safest form of investing finan-\ncial surpluses. According to the investor, the housing\nestate fits in with the current lifestyle trends, “for exam-\nple, minimalism that is popular among young people\n[...]. People from generation Y often spend most of their\ntime outside the home. They want to meet friends, play\nsports, and devote themselves to their passions.”\n\nA flawed system or the lack of\n\nwill?\n\nAccording to representatives of state authorities, the\nsolution to the problem and the only way to safeguard\npublic interest and the quality of living spaces lies in\nthe local spatial development plans (master plans). “We\nneed to fight such investment projects. The solution\n\nis primarily local plans” - this is how Deputy Minister\nAnna Kornecka, responsible for construction, spatial\nplanning and housing, commented on Bliska Wola in\nthe media.’ There might have been something to it if it\nwere not for the fact that the investment project is being\nimplemented in compliance with the currently valid\nmaster plan. Therefore, as in the case of the aforemen-\ntioned Wilno Estate, we are again faced with the issue of\nthe questionable quality of master plans that are being\ndeveloped in Poland — plans, which make it possible to\nproduce such pathological spaces.\n\nUnder the pressure of landowners, and in fear of\nattempts to challenge the provisions of master plans\nin court, local authorities often act against the public\ninterest. It is common for land status to be changed\nfrom agricultural to residential, for the buildings to be\nsupersized, for the introduced provisions to be far too\ngeneral. By now, the residential areas planned in this\nfaulty manner possibly already accommodate some two\nhundred million people.\" Worse, these estimates do not\nseem to take into account the investment creativity of\nreal estate developers who hide even more micro-apart-\nments under the cloak of commercial premises.\n\nIn order to heal the bad situation, action must be\ntaken from at least two directions simultaneously.\nAbove all, master plans should protect the interests of\nthe city and the local community as well as reducing\nenvironmental costs. That cannot be achieved with-\nout land consolidation; and so land for public services\nand greenery must be bought from or exchanged with\nprivate owners. Obviously, such activities are expen-\nsive and time-consuming. Where to get funds for their\nfinancing? The answer lies in the cadastral tax - whose\n\n79 NON-HOUSING\n\nintroduction has been postulated for years. Such\nmeasurable financial tool of spatial policy would allow\nthe municipality to profit as well, whenever it adopts a\ndevelopment plan favourable to the investor, because\nthe value of the land would increase. The income from\nthe cadastral tax, at least in part, could cover the costs\nrelated to utility infrastructure and the provision and\nmaintenance of public services.\n\nThe reform should begin with the spatial planning\nsystem in Poland. Planning approvals require greater\ncontrol and participation of the community representa-\ntion in their creation, and the introduced provisions\nmust be given greater legal force. Starting with the\nstudies of land use conditions and directions, all plan-\nning acts should be binding for investors. Today, the\nstudy has no legal force; local master plans must comply\nwith it, but the investments projects based on planning\npermits do not have to. As a result, many of the areas in\nPolish cities where the greatest investment pressure is\nfelt remain unplanned - suffice it to mention Krakéw’s\nKrowodrza and Grzegorzki, or almost the entire area of\nWarsaw’s Srodmiescie with Muranow, the East Wall, or\nPowisle.\n\nAt the same time, we need master plans that are\ndetailed enough to really shape the quality of the space\nin Polish cities: they should define the street grid, devel-\nopment areas, differentiation of functions, and their\nspatial distribution. Some of these postulates can be\nintroduced today, using the existing legal solutions. @\n\n \n\n€ Wilno Estate in Warsaw,\nApartment supply and investor: Dom Development,\nstandard, a comparison of design: HRA Architekci\nyears 1989-2017\n\n0 najstynniejszym polskim osiedlu, Money.pl,\n27.02.2021, https://www.money.pl/gospodarka/\nwszystkie-apartamenty-sprzedane-dewelo-\nper-jozef-wojciechowski-o-najslynniejszym-\n-polskim-osiedlu-6612477124819904a.html\n(accessed: 08.03.2021).\n\n13 Cyt. za: D.

The end result\ncaused a range of extreme reactions. The longstanding\nresidents of Nowa Huta responded with a bon mot: “We\nare living with a view of the park, your view will be that\nof a car park.” The reaction of younger people was more\nsurprising: for them, the patodeweloperka (“patho-de-\nvelopment” or dysfunctional development) squeezing\napartment sizes at the expense of the quality of space\nhas become the norm; some of the interviewees even\nvoiced their appreciation for the fact that a green spot of\nthe micro-park was featured in the visualizations of the\n“new” housing estate.\n\nThe reactions of young people, mostly from the\ngeneration who are repaying their mortgage loan or\nplanning to buy a flat, show how much we have got used\n\n>.\n\nto living in biedamodernizm (“poverty-modernism”) in\nPoland (the term coined by Kacper Pobtocki).?

If so, can we just as easily attempt to\nseek out the practices of “new modernism”?\n\nHousing in times of poverty-\n\nmodernism: patho-development\n\nand Excel-based cities\nSearching for any way out of the housing deadlock by\nredefining modernism would not be possible without\nsketching the mechanisms that force the idea of mass\nprovision of housing into the logic of profit.\n\nThe paradox of poverty-modernism is that the\nideas of Existenzminimum (minimum dwelling)’ were\nhijacked and used to “optimize” the efficiency of invest-\nments, that is, to reduce the necessary floor space in\norder to maximize profit. Developers reduce their costs\nand, at the same time, they are testing the tolerance\nthreshold of apartment buyers. Technological develop-\nment, allowing the acceleration of resource production,\nand the reduction of production costs, no longer serves\nthe purpose of mass housing programs; instead, it is\nused to improve financial results of real estate develop-\ners and the institutions that are financing the con-\nstruction projects. Its integration in design is not only\nabout applying progressively better technologies, but\nit also involves a close union between the form and the\nmarket results. The result of land speculation (in 2020,\non average, a quarter of the cost per one square meter of\nan apartment resulted from the cost of land) combined\nwith the projected rates of return on investment directly\ndictate the shape and nature of a housing development.\nThe latter, in a way, is a container for the products sold,\n\n82 LUKASZ PANCEWICZ\n\nwhich the individual apartments have become. Hence\nthe idea of cities created in an Excel spreadsheet. The\nidiom of finance was turned into a tool for describing\ncities and dictating the living conditions of their inhab-\nitants.¢ In this sense, the worst practices of real estate\n\ndevelopers resemble those known from the declining\nphase of late modernism, when it was essential for the\n\nbuilders of housing estates to meet the needs of invest-\nment efficiency - quantity over quality - rather than to\nimplement the assumptions of social housing estates. At\nbest, from the perspective of an average inhabitant of a\nPolish city, the parameters of the new buildings slightly\ndeviated from the standards and achievements of com-\nmunist-era apartment blocks.”\n\nRecently “discovered” by Warsaw activists, the\nphenomenon of “patho-development”,’ from the\nperspective of thirty years, is a logical consequence\nof the contest between costs, profits and the subject\nof optimization. When re-evaluating the principles of\nbuilding housing estates, if the usable floor space of\napartments is taken as the key parameter, the obvious\nfield for reducing standards are non-residential parts of\nthe investment project - green areas, services, time of\nsunlight access — designed at the statutory minimum\nlevel or even reduced as a result of “creative” interpreta-\ntion of regulations by designers. The illustrations of the\nlatter include the grotesque micro playgrounds, count-\ning green areas on balconies and terraces as bioactive\nsurfaces, and other developer “tricks”.

In line with the principles of market segmen-\ntation, developers are still trying to diversify the value\nof real estate properties in commercial housing estates,\nand they do so by improving these places. The elements\nof the modernist minimum - distance from the neigh-\nbour, presence of a green area, fulfilment of environ-\nmental conditions, comprehensive design of housing\nestates — this is what we may (or may not) get as a bonus,\nat most. The latest practice of the so-called corporate\nsocial responsibility works in a similar way: commit-\nment is parameterized, included in cost balances, and\nwoven into the PR narrative, nowadays an obligatory\nelement of commercial housing construction. In fact,\nthese are optional measures, contingent on the goodwill\nof investors, and not subjected to the standard.\n\nModernist dwelling as a result of\nrational planning\nA feature of modernist thinking was the idea of rebuild-\ning the city “from scratch” within the possibilities\noffered by new technological means, knowledge and\nactions of designers. In response to\nthe pathologies of the first version\n\nof industrial town, modernist planners created a new\nformula for the concept of dwelling and the city. Their\nweapons were twofold: social ideas and technological\nsolutions — prefabrication, development of construction\ntechniques, and new principles of composition. They\ncombined ideas, values, and action. Subsequent criti-\ncism by social activists and sociologists soon revised the\nreductionist aspirations of engineers, or the technocrats’\nmisunderstanding of urban complexity. Modernism,\nhowever, was a creative force with enormous influence.\nIn the field of housing, modernists, with the support of\nsocial housing programs, created significant housing\nresources and developed a set of rules for the organiza-\ntion of a good place to live. Universal concepts, such as\nthe creation of “neighbourhood units”, the provision of\ngreen areas, segregation of vehicle traffic, and linking\nhousing estates to public transport hubs, were applied\nand modified nationally and locally as part of “real exist-\ning modernisms”.?\n\nIf we were to look back - even at the risk of gross\noversimplification — and to examine the possibility to\nbuild the order of the “new modernism” in 2021, the\nstarting point should be the idea of pushing architec-\nture towards something more than merely profit-driven\nactivity. Following the example of modernists, we\nshould face the main challenges - the housing crisis,\nthe environmental crisis. It is impossible to discuss the\nconcepts of “new” modernism without addressing the\nissue of values. The modernists from a hundred years\nago were guided by the ideas of technological progress,\nalbeit closely related to the ideas of social reformers,\nmotivated by moral, often leftist, attitudes!° - the desire\nto improve housing conditions, health, and dignity\nof living. The practical application of these principles\nincluded cooperative housing estates, the progenitors of\nlarge-scale post-war public housing programs.\n\nDirectly related to large-scale design would be\nthe restoration of what I would tentatively call urban\nthinking, i.e. combining activities on a city scale, and\nits almost planetary range of influence.\" This involves\nbuilding and negotiating ideas and plans for the city\nthat go beyond the narrow horizons of individual\nschemes of private investors, or one part of the city; it is\nabout influencing the entire urban system. Modernists\nwere distinguished by their courage to act, the desire\nto push the boundaries of what was possible in terms\nof realisation, and the “optimism of the imagination”\ninvoked by Mike Davies.” This means permitting one-\nself to practise utopian design, to dream, to engage in\nintellectual speculation, in activities not focused solely\non efficiency. It is a practice that is contrary to market\nactivities, which are often characterized by conserva-\ntism, risk avoidance, or shrinking from engagement in\ncommunity activities. It is also connected with allowing\noneself to experiment, understood as novel building\n\nTHE NEED FOR NEW MODERNISM\n\npractices and testing the unknown. As it is impossible\nto effectively build a theoretical answer to the question\nof what living in a city could be in the era of climate\nchange; the only sensible option is an urban experi-\nment.¥\n\nCity as the space of experiment\nThe concept of the idea, test, and implementation, of\nstrategic activities on an urban scale, returns today not\nas total urban planning scheme created by a technocrat;\ninstead, it is more akin to the distributed city manage-\nment. This is probably the biggest single difference\nbetween the ideas of erstwhile modernists and today’s\ndesigners - the modernists were guided primarily by\nthe logic of “grand gesture”, they implemented mega-\nprojects, which were planned and executed by design-\ners-technocrats. We tend to associate modernism with\nmomentum, urbanity and courage.

Therefore, the domain of\nexperiment and change consists mainly of the city’s\nshared resources — public spaces and streets, urban\ninfrastructure and transportation systems, green spaces,\nmodest but still existing municipal housing resources.\n\nUrban “real utopias” on the citywide scale are never\na total, finished project. They arise as complex systems,\nprocesses and institutions, and they evolve with time -\nthey continue to develop and provide foundations for\nfurther activities. An example of implementing a utopia\nis the idea of a “fifteen-minute city” — the political\nslogan of Anne Hidalgo, the left-wing mayor of Paris,\nre-elected for the second term in office - which refers\nto the modernist ideas of the “neighbourhood unit”. It\nentails various actions on the part of the authorities:\nexcluding car traffic from the centre of the capital,\ngreening the city space, building safe roads to school\nfor children traveling by bike or on foot, neighbourhood\ninfrastructure — kindergartens, community centres.\n\nIn the communications by the authorities, technical\nsolutions are mentioned on a par with the idea of broad-\nening participation and sharing in decision-making. All\nthese activities are possible by accepting the common\nbenefits of reducing car traffic combined with planting\ntrees: improving air quality, combating heat waves, bet-\nter conditions of living. In practice, implementation is\nto be ensured by a combination of legal actions - regu-\nlation, testing, and application of new solutions or new\npublic projects.\n\nAnother long-term, complex activity in the sphere\nof housing is the so-called “Viennese model”, that is, an\nenduring public housing system that includes a number\nof activities: building up the public housing stock, nur-\nturing cooperative movement, and urban experiments\nin designing new housing estates. The guarantee of\nsuccess came from the consistent and coherent idea of\nensuring decent housing, and steadily maintaining the\nmechanism for over a hundred years.\n\nThe city as a public service\nProviding decent living conditions involves not only\nbuilding new structures, which is a departure from the\nmodernist concept of total city reconstruction, but also\nensuring access to the urban “new minimum”, i.e. com-\nmunity services in the existing urban areas.\n\nWhile referring, among other things, to Viennese\nsolutions and the ideas of co-living and co-housing,\nJoanna Erbel points out that apartments for rent could\nhelp us out of the impasse of the decreasing availability\nof mortgage credit-financed housing.“ The mecha-\nnisms of the modernist “welfare state” - guaranteed\naccess to basic public services - do not always meet the\n\nrequirements of complex life ina\nmodern city, the diverse needs, paths,\n\nLUKASZ PANCEWICZ\n\n    \n\nSi eae enaem\n\nand life choices. The problem concerns especially the\ndeparture from the family model in favour of various\nforms of being together — individually and socially. The\nemergence of new ways of living requires a review of\nthe activities that the designers of “hard-infrastructure\nmodernism” used to focus on. An example thereof was\nbuilding large block-of-flats housing estates, “machines\nfor living in” with a set of essential social facilities —\nschools, kindergartens, and parks. The realities of a\ncontemporary, diverse city require for this approach to\nbe further developed and supplemented with thinking\nabout neighbourhood infrastructure.\n\nMarket mechanisms try to keep up with consumer\nneeds through the actions of supervisory capitalism:\ngathering and analysing data, searching for links\nbetween behaviour in urban space and personalization\nand selection of services. The idea of “smart cities” was\nan expression of a technological digital utopia involving\nthe use of panoptical data analysis, while new concepts\nfocus on combining various kinds of information. New\nideas attempt to combine the analysis of market data\nand the knowledge about real estate resources with the\npractices of tracking user behaviour.'5 The new slogan\nis treating “the city as a service”, which means making\nthe availability of services more flexible and adapting\nthem to the mechanisms of free market choices. As a\nresult of the aforementioned organizational change,\ncities witnessed swift and efficient development of fran-\nchise networks of neighbourhood shops, logistics ser-\nvices’ market, and food deliveries using these activities.\nThis approach facilitates personalizing all these services\nas much as possible.\n\nThe opposite of the liquefaction and commer-\ncialization of services is the flight of capital from the\ncity’s non-profit functions and the atrophy of public\nresources. This process results in withdrawal from\nunprofitable public services: closing schools which lose\nstudents, and selling the buildings; selling the munici-\npal stock of real estate properties, and withdrawing from\nmaintaining transport functions.\n\nCreating a city that provides the right combina-\ntion of quality-of-housing services needs to rely ona\ncombination of public activities and should be comple-\nmented by commercial services. In a proto-modern city,\nthe development of public infrastructure determined\nwhether urbanization would favour the creation of\nfriendly places to live; almost a century later, nothing\nhas changed. The organization of housing environment\nis associated with ensuring the basic minimum, and\nthat is still based primarily on public services — a park,\na school, the access to public transport. At the same\ntime, the public side should provide space to support\nthe essential needs resulting from various life paths\n— namely, meeting places for various neighbourhood\nactivities.\n\nUrban modernists fought for access to light, clean\nair, transport; today, the list is supplemented by a social\ninfrastructure that allows avoiding the problem of lone-\nliness, facilitates meeting residents of the same district,\nprovides respite from living in ever smaller apartments,\nand improves environmental conditions. The desire\nto shape the urban environment means caring for and\nestablishing urban green areas and squares, creating\nsocial infrastructure - community centres and libraries",
    "Page_87": "— or even maintaining alternative trade venues, such as\nneighbourhood marketplaces. A parallel activity is the\ndevelopment of mechanisms enabling the financial sur-\nvival of the aforementioned services: preferential rent,\nfacilitated subsidizing of such activities by the users,\nreducing legal and organizational obstacles.\n\nLearning from the modernists - a\nhousing estate-scale experiment\nThe orders of new modernism do not mean abandoning\n\nthe idea of building new housing estates as alternative\nhousing schemes. In our private conversation about\nNowe Zerniki, one of the few new Polish “model housing\nestates”,\"” Wroctaw-based architect Mikotaj Smoleriski\nmentioned his desire to create a housing estate com-\nparable to the achievements of WUWA architects or\ncomprehensive projects of socialist housing estates. The\nidea of Wohnungsausstellung — an exhibition of archi-\ntecture created as a living prototype and a model fora\ndifferent, better formula for building apartments - was\nconsciously adopted by the designers of the Wroctaw\nhousing estate. Apart from Zerniki, other attempts\n\nwere made to build such districts, mainly in Warsaw:\nWarszawska Dzielnica Spoteczna (Warsaw Social Dis-\ntrict, WDS), Jeziorki, and Osiedla Warszawy (Warsaw\nEstates). Only Zerniki has been fully implemented. All\nthese projects have a common denominator: dissatisfac-\ntion with the standard of currently emerging commer-\ncial housing estates and “mobilising the imagination” of\ntheir authors.\n\nShared motivation, collective creativity and the will\nto improve the city found their expression in an unprec-\nedented cooperation of the “super-studio” - a collective\nof over forty architects from different generations. This\ngesture symbolically negated the practice of compet-\ning for a commission, which is typical of commercial\narchitects. The departure from the commercial mode\nof operation was to reverse another aspect of the profit\nlogic. The starting point for the design of Zerniki was to\nbe the reorganization and improvement of the way of\nliving, rather than the production of square meters, as in\nmost commercial projects.\n\nThe completed Nowe Zerniki is also an example of a\nnew version of the idea for a complete urban unit, a new\nneighbourhood, with services and public spaces. The\nWroctaw housing estate was created as a result of a com-\nprehensive process, starting with workshop sketches\nand ending with the construction of buildings. In a way,\nit is a distant echo of massive housing construction\nprograms. Not in terms of scale, of course. The experi-\nmental model housing estates are still small, and they\nlack the momentum of mass industrialized production.\nInstead, what they have in common with modernist\ndesigns is the comprehensive process of shaping space.\nIn terms of tools, it is the restoration of designing\n\npractice, which is rarely used in Poland today.'8 Within\nthat practice, the design covers all the elements of a\nhousing estate comprehensively, combining different\nscales of design (from urban to architectural) as well as\ncovering all aspects of the estate (residential buildings,\ncommon spaces). Designers of the Wroctaw housing\nestate, at least at the first stage, departed from the effi-\nciency regime - they abandoned the idea of employing\nan architect for quick project implementation in favour\nof workshop and design activities aimed at developing\nthe main assumptions for the estate. Under the assump-\ntions of WDS and Osiedla Warszawy, specialists from\nother fields —- housing and sociology - also joined in the\nprocess of creating designing guidelines. The projects\nwere publicly consulted — this was also a departure from\ncommercial reductionism in favour of holistic practices.\nMost of the large-scale model projects are built with\npublic backing. In the case of the Wroctaw housing\nestate, architects from the SARP persuaded the munici-\npal authorities to take joint action. Thanks to the coop-\neration with the city, it was possible to provide public\nland for the estate, to develop a comprehensive idea in\nthe test design formula,” to safeguard the negotiated\nconcept within the provisions of the local plan, and to\nbuild the essential infrastructure. The city was responsi-\nble for the sale of land and the gradual implementation\nof the housing mix: commercial and communal housing,\nTBSs (building societies), and cooperatives. Therefore,\nthe public party acted as a co-organizer of the whole\nprocess, and at the same time promoted best practices\nthat would not have been possible otherwise, under\ndifferent circumstances. The planning has worked in\ncombination with the public form of ownership.\n\n“New Modernism” as the practice\nof building a good city\n\nThe exercise in Nowa Huta reveals that thirty years after\nwe started building a neo-liberal city model, we have\nplunged into a serious crisis of imagination connected\nwith the command of “Excel formula cities”. There\ncomes a moment when change becomes necessary — not\nonly because of the housing problem, but also because\nof the existential challenge posed by the climate crisis.\nCritique of the old modernism, apart from dismantling\nthe model of building large, comprehensive housing\nestates, did not propose an effective alternative to the\nideas that guided the modernist revolution. As archi-\ntects and city planners, we must take responsibility\nfor creating a good and dignified place to live in cities.\nOur inspiration is certainly the modernist courage in\ndeveloping a new mode of operation, activating the col-\nlective imagination, the willingness to carry out urban\nexperiments, and to practice a city that is responsible\ntowards others.?° Good intentions are most emphatically\nnot enough. If the experience of modernism teaches us\n\n85 THE NEED FOR NEW MODERNISM\n\nanything, it is first and foremost a lesson about the key\nrole of the public base in supporting radical housing\ninnovation. For several decades, solving strategic urban\nchallenges — fast construction of good quality housing\nstock, its servicing with social and technical infrastruc-\nture — has become the subject of public attention.\n\nThe three decades of cities’ privatization has torn\nthrough the thinking and acting in the field, and left a\nsignificant gap. To answer Kusiak’s question, the imple-\nmentation of the new order, apart from giving room for\nhuman invention and re-evaluation in thinking about\nhousing, must rely on the actions of the public side -\nthat is, the local governments — as well as the social side.\nThe tools for building a “new modernism” must include\nnot only ideas and “real existing utopias”, but also\nchanges in the law, the use of fiscal tools (for example,\ncadastral tax), public projects, practices of managing\ncommon resources, moderating community debates,\nresisting free market and privatization temptations. @\n\n€\nIntensywna zabudowa osiedla\nAvia w Czyzynach, Krakow\n\nPhoto: Jarek Matla\n\n14 J.

Its\nadvisory council was made up of ministers and rep-\nresentatives of eminent institutions. The nominees\nincluded the Debno housing estate, developed by the\nKurzetnik municipality. It is undoubtedly commendable\nthat the municipality, through its own investment, cre-\nates new opportunities to meet housing needs in areas\nwhere real estate developer activity is hardly present.\n\nBefore we give our final verdict, however, let us take\na closer look at the investment project in question. Its\narchitecture, to put it mildly, “does not bring you to\nyour knees”. In terms of urban planning, it deserves\nstrong criticism — it is situated outside the urbanized\narea, sandwiched between a sand mine, and some farm\nbuildings. Nearby is the beautifully meandering river\nDrweca, an additional argument against this being the\nright place for a complex of apartment blocks.\n\nSo, does this - clearly defective - public investment\nproject really deserve recognition from the members of\nthe advisory council? Of course not, and yet it received\nsuch an endorsement. It is a failure of the municipality,\nwhich “treated” the inhabitants to such living condi-\ntions, but also of us all as a society - even though neither\nthe “experts” awarding the nominations nor the public\nseem to notice the problem. The biggest losers are the\nnew tenants, ready to settle for living in a substandard\nlocation — because they have no comparable offers to\nchoose from, they do not know that they could expect\nmore, and they do not anticipate the problems that\nliving in such location may involve.\n\nIfa similar project was implemented by private\nentrepreneurs, one would typically complain about\ntheir unscrupulous drive for profit and the philosophy\nof “sell and forget”, subject closed. However, this is a\npublic investment. Importantly, it is not an exception,\nbecause public investors have produced many more\nsuch “mishaps”. When the first project within the frame-\nwork of the government housing program “Mieszkanie\nPlus” (a housing estate near Jarocin) was commissioned,\ninformation about it featured in all media. No attention\nwas paid to the location of the housing estate and the\nlocation of the buildings - crying shame from the point\nof view of quality of life and climate challenges.\n\nWe can and we must demand more from a public\ninvestor. After all, they do not operate for profit, but in\nthe public interest — that is, in principle, they are work-\ning for the benefit of all. Unfortunately, in order to make\nthat demand, we would first need to have awareness\nand social control, exercised, for example, by the media.\nIf we had them, we would have a chance to create a\n\ncertain STANDARD, which could also\n\nbe a reference point when assessing\n\ncommercial residential investment projects. Meanwhile,\nit seems that we collectively participate in a kind of\ngame of make-believe - mediocrity bothers very few\npeople; others are even prone to praise it. In this way, as\na society, we greatly reduce our chances for high quality.\n\nA debate leading nowhere\nTo say that we do not at all value the quality of housing\ndevelopment would be an oversimplification. Recently,\nthe expression “patodeweloperka” (patho-development,\npathological or dysfunctional real estate development)\nhas become immensely popular, and a succession of\nshocking examples of the phenomenon that it defines\ncan be found flagged in social and traditional media.\nHowever, these are mostly used to entertain (yes, they\noften make you laugh out loud) or to relieve righteous\nexasperation. It is much less often that they give rise toa\nprofounder discussion about their causes; for example,\nabout what mechanisms have been driving the recent\npressure to increase the floor to area ratio - wherever the\nplanning guidelines are not precise enough. Does this\ndensity of development result from the developers’ lack\nof scruples and greed, or is it a market process derived\nfrom a defective spatial planning system? Since it gives\nsomeone the opportunity to significantly “plump up”\ntheir investment, the competition forces others to also\n“squeeze as much out of their plots as possible”. The sys-\ntemic consent to the chaotic urban sprawl has a similarly\ndestructive effect - the permissibility of the construction\nof subsequent housing estates in random and scattered\nsuburban locations, often with a dramatically poor spa-\ntial structure. The analogy to the “bad money driving out\ngood” comes to mind. The widespread awareness of the\nproblem and the increased media interest therein have\nnot yet led to any significant changes for the better.\n\nOn the other hand — paradoxically — the average\nstandard of a housing development has been improving\nin recent years. In large cities, in the face of competing\nfor clients, more and more developers are paying atten-\ntion to common spaces between buildings, facilities for\npedestrians and bicycles, access to public transport, etc.\nThe number of fences is decreasing, public recreational\nspaces are being arranged, and numerous housing estates\nare gaining a block structure with service premises in the\nground floors. Often such spatial arrangement results\nfrom the local zoning plan, but the fight for clients seems\nto be a stronger factor. The latter can be measured by\nthe degree of finding one’s place on the market, because\nsignificant differences in the approach to the above-\nmentioned issues are visible even among real estate\ndevelopers of neighbouring estates, implemented on the\nbasis of the same planning acts. Those more ambitious\nand/or reliable undoubtedly deserve praise, and it would\nbe desirable for their behaviour to set a new STAND-\nARD. However, we must remember that the process of\n\nWILL URBAN STANDARD SAVE US?\n\n“improving” a housing product has its limits. On the one\nhand, it is certainly weakened by the current situation of\nunsatisfied demand, in which an apartment is primarily\nan investment of capital and you can sell it without much\neffort; on the other hand, we cannot naively expect that\ndevelopers will rationally arrange our cities on their own\naccord, relying solely on market mechanisms. Their\n\narea of intervention is generally limited to the building\nplot. Although recently more and more comprehensive\nprojects have been developed, leading to the construction\nof large districts (with some benefit to their quality — see\nfor example Wilno Estate in Warsaw’s Targowek district),\nindividual developers will not - we should hope - build\nor rebuild entire cities.\n\nLonging for the standard\nThis is where we must return to the subject of public\nauthority. Its action and its endeavours are necessary to\nensure that the contribution of new housing develop-\nments to the creation of a good city is the norm, rather\nthan an occasional resultant of various factors. O\n\n \n\nVirtually every discussion\nin this context uses the\nslogan “urban standard”; the\nintroduction, or rather the resto-\nration of the latter is suggested\nby every proposal for reforming\nthe planning system in Poland.\nAnd rightly so, although the\napproach to that standard is\nprobably a bit unrealistic. Older\ntown planners fondly remember\nit as an element of the times\nwhen effective design and\nimplementation of urban guide-\nlines were simpler than they\n\nare today; the younger ones\nidealistically see it as a symbol\nof the “era of better urban plan-\nning”, in which so much space\nwas left between the buildings\nfor greenery that today crea-\ntive developers often “manage”",
    "Page_90": "to squeeze another full-sized\nblock of flats in the middle.\n\nIt is true that in the People’s Republic of Poland there\nwere regulations on the urban planning norm. They\nwere last updated in 1974 and in theory they continued\nto apply until the mid-1980s. They defined, among\nother things, standards for furnishing residential areas\nwith technical infrastructure, securing green areas, and\nensuring access to various amenities, including public\nservices. The norm lost its relevance completely with\nthe local government reform, and the subsequent adop-\ntion of the law on spatial development in 1994. In the\ncompletely changed systemic conditions, it was decided\nthat it was no longer necessary to impose anything on\nthe municipal town planners. They would know best,\ngiven the specific local conditions, how to determine\nland development indicators and other principles and\nparameters of urban planning.\n\nWhile this approach may appear to be a gross negli-\ngence today, back then it was not entirely irrational. All\nareas based on the professionalism and inventiveness of\nthe designer do not succumb easily to rigid, top-down\nregulations — and if they are forced to do so, it usually\nhappens to the detriment of the final designing deci-\nsions. For example, in complex cases, the technical con-\nditions for buildings tend to be too strict, and they are\nblocking the implementation of rational ideas, and yet\nthey do not offer protection against substandard solu-\ntions, for example in the aspect of daylight exposure.\n\nLawmakers in the early 1990s made a mistake. They\ndid not foresee the development of the situation, and\nmore specifically, they did not anticipate how the new\nrealities would affect urban planning: that in most cases\nit would cease to be a sphere of creative activity of a\nprofessional project team, but instead it would become\nan area of non-transparent synthesis of various condi-\ntions — legal judgments and interpretations, financial\npossibilities of the municipality, and often not very\ntransparent agendas and particular interests. In sucha\nsystem there may not be enough space for state-of-the-\nart, good-practice design decisions. The difficulty with\nthe resulting local plans concerns not even inappropri-\nate urban planning parameters, but often, instead, it is\ntheir limited regulatory importance that is the problem.\nThey do not contain appropriate provisions, or they\nformulate their guidelines so “loosely” that a stubborn\ninvestor will coerce an interpretation that is favourable\nto him, ruining the original concept on which the local\nplan was based.\n\n1 “Lex developer” is a popular name of the Spe-\ncial Housing Act that came into force in Poland\nin 2018.\n\n88 RAJMUND RYS\n\nIt is not that simple\nTherefore, the urban planning standard should\nundoubtedly be introduced. We do not know whether\nit will be an easy and obvious procedure, and what its\neffects will be. Many questions arise. Will all newly\nconstructed residential buildings in Poland fit into the\ncomplete urban structure as a result, and will it be the\nonly result? Will there be side effects? O\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nby regulation. Clearly, the classic “I'll think about it\ntomorrow” kind of solution - better still, let someone\nelse think about it, that is, the relevant ministry.\n\nA quality determinant or a barrier?\nAnd yet “urban standards” are something more than\na theoretical entity in our legislation. To some extent,\nthey are already operational as part of the infamous “lex\n\nThe basic question is what the urban standard should look\nlike. What should its scope and functioning mechanism be?\n\nWould it apply uniformly to the territory of the whole country, or\nwould it be differentiated depending on the characteristics of the\nmunicipality, type of development, or other parameters specific\nfor the given area? Or perhaps individual municipalities should be\nallowed to modify the standard (if so, only to tighten it, or also\n\nto alleviate it?) or to extend it thematically? Would it apply only to\nthe area without detailed local plans, or would it be binding when\n\nthose plans are developed?\n\nIt turns out that if the legislators wanted to develop\nan optimal solution - one that would solve as many\nproblems as possible and cause as few complications as\npossible - then in virtually all of the above issues, each\nof the options would have its advantages and disadvan-\ntages. Perhaps the biggest challenge is related to the\ncorrect definition of the substantive scope of the stand-\nard, and the manner of its formulation. One can reject\nin advance the option of using the normative of the Peo-\nple’s Republic of Poland, if only because of the changes\nin the lifestyle that have occurred over the last fifty\nyears; these changes directly translate into completely\ndifferent needs in the way that housing complexes are\nshaped. Translating new needs into regulations will be\nquite problematic. I will use an example from the times\nof the Building Law Codification Commission, work-\ning on the Urban Planning and Construction Code (in\n2013-2014). A group of professionals and masterminds\nplanned to restore the standard, but while trying to\nformulate it, they came across some obstacles. A set of\nconditions emerged that did not match the most impor-\ntant development challenges —- for example, members\nof the commission proposed making the permissible\nnumber of storeys dependent on the size of the city.\n\nAs a result of Edward Gierek’s decision, there are eleven-\nstorey blocks of flats in Stubice, with the population of\n16 thousand, and they do not seem to have any impact\non the urban problems of this city. In any case, the pro-\nfessors from the committee quickly gave up the onerous\ntask, and in the draft of the standards code they only\nentered a designation to develop and issue standards\n\ndeveloper” act.‘ The structure of the latter leads us to\nquestion the remnants of rationality in what is called\nthe spatial planning system in Poland (and which some\nargue does not even deserve that term). The scope of\napplication of the law is smaller than assumed by its\nauthors, but this does not alleviate its sins. Moreover,\nmany find positive aspects in it today, and derive from\nit the defective financing mechanism of social infra-\nstructure by real estate developers — which only proves\nthe extent of desperation of local governments who are\nlacking effective urban planning tools. Urban standards\nare seen as an undoubtedly positive aspect of the “lex\ndeveloper” act — and rightly so —- but attention should be\npaid to the way they are used in the application of this\nact. Typically, municipalities try to oppose the buildings\nproposed by investors that are inconsistent with local\nplans. In those cases, statutory urban standards, often\nadditionally tightened by the municipalities, turn out to\nbea helpful tool: they prevent the construction of unde-\nsirable buildings.\n\nAnd so we are arriving at the heart of the matter. What\nis the purpose of the urban standards that we are think-\ning about: to block the construction of new buildings,\nor to shape them? It seems that introducing the stand-\nards as universally applicable would have the same\neffect as the “lex developer” act: a large part of the\nplanned investment ventures could not be completed.\nAlthough real estate development companies evidently\nabuse this argument in discussions about systemic\nchanges, in this context it is an actual fear that the\navailability of new housing would decrease, and prices\nwould increase due to the limited supply. Therefore, the",
    "Page_91": "standards alone are not enough to heal the situation.\nAssociated legal mechanisms are needed in order to\nensure the emergence of new infrastructure. Restoring\nthe urban standard cannot be a one-off, “spot” reform\nout of context, but it must be aligned with a number\nof other changes to the system, especially in terms of\nfinancing urbanization.\n\nAdditionally, when you want to use the standards\n“in a positive way”, the nuances that could be omitted\nin the case of “lex developer” will become important.\nThe requirement for access to a public transport stop is\nseemingly a zero-one variable, but if you evaluate the\nactual expediency for future residents, you should take\ninto account the range of transport offer from this stop,\nas well as other issues that are included in the urban\nprimer, but are difficult to translate into the language of\na mandatory legal act. For example, if the stop is located\nat the required distance from a residential building, and\nthe kindergarten is also located at a required distance,\nbut in the opposite direction, then the functionality of\nsuch a system for the resident will be limited, despite its\nbeing in accordance with the regulations. Common sense\nshould be used in the context of urban planning stand-\nards — and this is something that is difficult to achieve\nwhen it comes to applying and interpreting generally\napplicable law. If there is no school at the appropriate\ndistance in a new housing estate, regulations may require\nits construction even in a situation where just a little\nfurther, in another housing estate whose population have\nalready “matured”, and which has good public transport\naccess, there is a school that is only partially used.\n\nIn times of chaos and crisis\nIt is also worth asking ourselves how many new hous-\ning estates are we still going to build, because it is for\ntheir creation that urban standards seem to be an ideal\ntool (just as they were during the People’s Republic of\nPoland). Designing a new housing estate is relatively sim-\nple: it is easy to estimate the number of inhabitants and\nshape the spatial structure adequately, without\nforgetting any functions required by the standards.\nIf further spatial development (does it really deserve to\nbe called that?) in Poland follows the current dynamics\nand continues to apply the unchanged formal and quali-\ntative principles — then a lot of new projects will actually\nbe constructed.\n\nThe challenges facing us today should, after all,\nforce us to rapidly change the way of thinking about the\ndesired directions of spatial development in our country.\nAlready in 2015, the principle of situating new buildings\nby supplementing the existing ones was introduced into\nthe planning act. In particular, this should mean the best\npossible use of developed areas - those that have lost\ntheir former functions, as well as those built up haphaz-\nardly: temporarily, accidentally, and extensively. It would\n\nbe impossible to argue that this principle is being con-\nsistently implemented at present. The blame lies chiefly\nwith the lingering, perverse mechanism of issuing a\n“decision on land development conditions” (also known\nas zoning decisions). However, the lack of consistency\ndoes not invalidate the importance of the principle, on\nthe contrary — there are all the more arguments for it.\nEven though the announced EU regulations limiting the\npossibility of additional soil sealing have not yet come\n\nto pass, some countries, with their actions, have already\nembarked in this direction, treating it as one of the mech-\nanisms to counteract climate change. Poland, a European\nlaggard in the area of water retention, must also follow\nthis path sooner or later.\n\nMeanwhile, around Polish cities, not only the largest,\nbut also those quite small, “rings of spontaneous subur-\nbanization” are growing - bigger and bigger areas built\nup haphazardly and with varying intensity. They will not\n“repair themselves” spontaneously, nor will they become\nfriendly and well-functioning living spaces. The priori-\nties of climate-responsible and economically responsible\nurban planning in Poland should focus on precisely those\nareas. Instead of creating new “ideal” housing estates, it\nis first necessary to take care of such spatial planning that\non the one hand would minimize the area intended for\nland sealing, and on the other hand, would repair the cur-\nrent dysfunctional structure of suburban built environ-\nment. It is about functional and environmentally rational\nfilling the gaps in chaotically dispersed buildings, and\nan attempt to transform them into sensible housing\ncomplexes with access to services and efficient public\ntransport connection to central cities. The task seems\nenormous, and it probably really is so. It is worth making\nsure that the way the future universal urban standard\nis formulated does not pose any additional complica-\ntions — therefore in the case of the areas of “spontaneous\nsuburbanization” it should be sufficiently flexible.\n\nLegislative remedy to cure all evil?\nWhat is the conclusion from the above considerations?\nThere is no doubt that an urban standard is necessary.\nThe philosophy of spatial planning, which boils down\nto the principle of “each municipality will know best\nhow to shape the spatial order in their area”, unfortu-\nnately — as is only evident — did not work. Therefore,\napart from the procedures, the regulations must include\nsubstantive content safeguarding the guaranteed min-\nimum quality of planning studies. On the other hand,\nthey should be formulated in such a way that the baby\nis not thrown out with the bathwater. If necessary, they\nshould enable the municipality and the designer using\nhis own knowledge and techniques to flexibly approach\nthe application of at least some elements of the stand-\nard. Of course, we need to make sure that this flexibility\ndoes not go too far. The statutory expanding of the\n\n89 WILL URBAN STANDARD SAVE US?\n\nmechanisms of social participation in the development\nof planning acts will be useful here.\n\nIndeed. The introduction of the urban standard as an\nexclusive and self-contained reform of spatial planning\nwill not work. As already indicated, in order for it to\nbring real and positive change, it must be related to\nother changes in the spatial planning system, especially\nin terms of effective financing of urbanization and elimi-\nnation of uncontrolled development in previously unde-\nveloped areas, but also in terms of rationalization and\nimprovement of planning procedures, broadening the\npermissible scope of content regulated by local plans, as\nwell as the aforementioned social participation.\n\nAt this point, many of you will ask about one more\nkey aspect: what about the existing housing that will\nnot meet the new, universal urban standards? There are\ncertainly many such cases. Would they also be subject\nto these regulations? Of course, in theory it is possible to\nformulate such law, but what would it achieve? Wher-\never the conditions are not met, the local government\nwould have to build the missing schools, kindergar-\ntens, widen the streets and sidewalks, launch public\ntransport? Undoubtedly, such legal norm would join\nthe litany of useless laws and generally ignored regula-\ntions, and after years of zoning free-for-all and chaotic\ndispersal of built environment, it would lead to many\ndifficult dilemmas. I do not believe that we are mentally\nor financially ready, for example, to demolish some of\nthe buildings in a development that is too dense in order\nto fill the deficit of green areas, although probably, in\nthe future, we could also think about that. Moreover, in\nsome cases an obligation to conform to a rigid standard\nwould be simply unfair. Why should a local community\nbear the above-standard costs of supplementing the\ninfrastructure for people who consciously decided to\nlive in locations where such infrastructure was missing\nand where it was never planned in the first place? On\nthe other hand, even without statutory provisions, local\ngovernment officials know where in their area there are\ndeficiencies in terms of infrastructure or access to public\nservices. This knowledge is communicated in letters,\npetitions, or protests of dissatisfied residents, yet local\nauthorities do not keep up in terms of meeting these\nexpectations. The essence of the problem lies not so\nmuch in the lack of regulations on adapting the existing\nbuildings to specific standards, as in the lack of financ-\ning. This is an element of the aforementioned funda-\nmental omission in Polish urban planning regulations\n— the lack of rational and effective economic mecha-\nnisms that would ensure the formation of the whole,\ncomplete city, i.e. residential development with parallel\nimplementation of infrastructure and guaranteed access\nto public services and green areas.\n\nToday, when so much “milk has already been\nspilled”, formulating rational rules is more difficult",
    "Page_92": "than ever. It is all too easy to assume that the costs of\nnew urbanization are to be borne by its users, but then\nhow to finance the redressing of shortcomings where\nhouses have already been built? Should we introduce a\nuniversal infrastructure charge? Each potential solution\nwill find its opponents, and the development of a fair\nmechanism will be extremely challenging, because it is\ndifficult to take into account all the pre-existing complex\nconditions. For example, where residents in the past\nco-financed the infrastructure (for example through the\nso-called adjacent fee, a betterment levy), a universal\ninfrastructure fee would force them to do so again. This\nis probably the most difficult aspect in the necessary\nreform of the planning system. Alas, from the public\ndebate so far it does not appear that the proponents of\nnew solutions actually focus on these issues.\n\nLet us, however, be optimistic and assume that\nthe new and comprehensive legislative solutions\nwill become binding law. When that happens, does it\nmean that overnight we will enter a straight and wide\npath towards improved space and a specific housing\nSTANDARD in Poland? Probably not. As experiences\nwith changes in spatial planning systems have shown,\nnot everything goes according to the intention of the\nlegislator. Interpretations and jurisprudence have led us\nto stray from many a rational solution. In addition, there\nis the unstoppable inventiveness of some investors and\ndesigners in circumventing the adopted regulations.\nThe relevant groups in social media would probably\nsoon fill with discussions on how to “bend” or interpret\na given regulatory requirement in order to continue\nbuilding the old way. Even if this is only a marginal pur-\nsuit, and the introduced legal solutions turn out to be\nfairly effective, we will still need someone to build these\ndistricts according to the established standards.\n\nSo much to do, right now\nTherefore, legislation needs to be a significant, albeit\none of the many areas of action, which public authori-\nties take. Spatial policy cannot be reduced only to legal\nchanges at the national level, or planning acts at the\nlocal level. It is no less important to promote specific\nattitudes, build awareness, communicate expectations\nand wishes to investors, and set a good example. The lat-\nter aspect seems particularly essential. When represent-\natives of local authorities complain about spatial chaos\nor low-quality commercial development, they do not\nsound credible if the municipality allots poor locations\nfor its municipal projects or TBS investment ventures,\nor if it gives up investment activity in the housing area\naltogether.\n\nMeanwhile, it is the municipality’s investment\nactivity that has an enormous potential to create a\nSTANDARD - that is, to establish good practice in terms\nof the shape and the location of investment projects that\n\n90 RAJMUND RYS\n\ncommercial investors should match.

O\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nadoption of planning acts (or the lack thereof), but it is\nalso easy to notice the correlation with whether the city\nis implementing ambitious downtown housing invest-\nments.

Unfortunately, in some cit-\nies, there is no noticeable tendency to locate residential buildings\nin the centre, regardless of the availability of vacant land. A good\nexample from the municipal investor would be useful.\n\nSome of the largest Polish cities - Warsaw, Lodz,\nGdansk, and Szczecin - have completed numerous\nown housing investments in central areas. Besides, in\nlarge cities there is the greatest potential to formulate\ninnovative projects, whose main objective is to create a\nbenchmark for high-quality housing - both public and\ncommercial. In this context, it is impossible not to men-\ntion the award-winning Nowe Zerniki housing estate in\nWroctaw and the unfortunately unfinished initiatives in\nthe capital: the Warsaw Housing Standard (Warszawski\nStandard Mieszkaniowy), and the Warsaw Social District\n(Warszawska Dzielnica Spoteczna). It is a pity indeed\nthat such projects are few and sensitive to staff changes\nand procedural complications. They have a long way to\ngo — it really seems like light years — until they reach the\nscale and importance of projects with similar aspira-\ntions that we find abroad, such as the successive IBA\n“exhibitions”, which are organized in various locations\nin Germany.\n\nThe few good examples\nThe role of the public investor as a promoter of the\nurban STANDARD is sorely needed in smaller cities,\nwhere, private developers are few and they often lack\nincentives to compete with each other in terms of qual-\nity. In these circumstances, the city’s activity within the\nhousing market becomes a necessity.\n\nIf we cast a broader comparative look at Polish\nmedium-sized and smaller cities, we will notice clear\ndifferences in their spatial development. In some of\nthem, new or modernized buildings, mainly residential,\ncomplement the earlier urban tissue and enrich the\nstructure of the city. In others, new residential build-\nings are being built, but their location in no way fits in\nwith a well-thought-out plan for improving or shaping\naresidents-friendly city. Usually, this differentiation is\nrelated to a more or less rational spatial policy and the\n\nappearance), some have only recently embarked on\nthis path of development — including Stargard, Stupsk,\nSuwatki, Konin, Kwidzyn, and Wtoctawek. This model\nof operation is also accessible to towns of really small\nsizes. A TBS has been operating in Karlino (less than six\nthousand inhabitants) since 1997, and has already com-\npleted numerous investment ventures. Some of these\nare small buildings filling the gaps in the existing built\ndevelopment, and shaping the present-day image of the\ntown. Without their investment activity, Karlino would\nundoubtedly look quite different.\n\nCurrently, few smaller cities take up the challenge of\nactively and consciously shaping the housing develop-\nment in their area, particularly such development that\nhas the ambition to create a STANDARD. This deficit is\none of the key challenges for our housing policy, and\nalso a crucial spatial and demographic challenge. What\nis an exception today must be made a universal rule.\n\nBut how can we achieve that? First, it is necessary to\nunderstand what it is that produces the success of the\naforementioned cities. They probably owe the most to\nthe right people in the right places, to their work ethos,\nand to the continuity of ideas and actions.\n\nIn order to transform the occasional attention to the\nquality of living conditions into something common and\nuniversal, a multiple and versatile action is necessary,\nand we need to focus on the effects achieved by the lead-\ning, benchmark cities. This requires linking legislative\nactivities with the education and support of officials and\nagencies, appropriate financing tools, various mecha-\nnisms of promotion, pressure and regulation on the part\nof public authorities aimed at investors, and building\nmarket awareness among consumers who should not be\nsatisfied with mediocrity.\n\nIf most of the issues on this list can be at least par-\ntially addressed, it is to be hoped that the STANDARD\nwill indeed become standard. e",

It implements the con-\ncept of direct democracy not in the political dimension,\nbut in the direct building of the economy. Cooperatives\ncan be treated as an economic utopia built around the\nideals of equality and self-governance, or as one of the\nmethods of managing a company. Either way, we should\nnot forget that they are primarily a social movement.\n\nCooperative movement began to emerge since the\nmid-eighteenth century in England, the most devel-\noped capitalist country at the time. The first consumer\ncooperatives collapsed quickly — it turned out that ideas\nalone, without good organization and political support,\nwere not enough. The establishment of the Society of\nEquitable Pioneers in 1844, a consumer cooperative of\nweavers from Rochdale, is considered a breakthrough\nfor the cooperative movement. The principles for-\nmulated at that time still form the foundation of the\ninternational cooperative movement, and are called\nthe Rochdale principles. Six, seven, or sometimes eight\nlegendary founding rules are listed. The Polish National\nCooperative Council (Polska Krajowa Rada Spétdzielcza)\nincluded them in the following points:!\n\n1. The principle of voluntary and open\nmembership;\n\n2. The principle of democratic mem-\nber control;\n\n3. The principle of member economic\nparticipation;\n\n4. The principle of autonomy and\nindependence;\n\n5. The principle of education, training,\n\nand information;\n\nThe principle of cooperation;\n\n7. The principle of concern for the\nlocal community.\n\n@\n\nCooperatives developed the fastest in the area of food\nproduction and distribution. By the end of the nine-\nteenth century, cooperatives accounted for up to 15 per\ncent of retail turnover in some countries. A social utopia\nhas been turned into an efficient — or at least feasible —\neconomic model that encompassed agriculture, com-\nmerce, industry and, later, also housing.\n\nRecently, the ideas of cooperatives are gaining more\nand more popularity, and some point towards them as\nan alternative to today’s form of capitalism; a solution\nthat would lead to a fairer and more sustainable eco-\nnomic development. Housing cooperatives are part of\nthis strategy. To illustrate the latter, the most frequently\ncited example is the city of Zurich, where coopera-\ntives own as much as 38 per cent of the housing stock\n\n(although the average for the entire Switzerland is only\n5 per cent); three-quarters of them are small organiza-\ntions, managing about ninety flats each, although there\nare larger ones that take care of 5,000 flats.” Large insti-\ntutions, in the segment of one thousand to five thousand\napartments, dominate in Germany. There are a total of\ntwo thousand such cooperatives in Germany, and they\ncomprise a total of 2.2 million flats, which is slightly\nmore than 5 per cent of the country’s housing stock.?\nMany German cities support the development of small\ncooperatives as a city-forming instrument and a means\nto supplement the built environment of downtowns,\n\nor to activate communities in newly emerging districts.\nBerlin and Hamburg are best known for such activities.\n\nEven against the background of the European\nleaders - Germany and Switzerland, Poland is a unique\ncountry. In our reports, we are breaking records in\nterms of cooperative construction, also in comparison\nto other post-socialist countries. As recently as in 2015,\n16.2 per cent of the Polish housing stock belonged to\ncooperatives, while neighbours with a similar history of\npublic support for cooperative building models retained\nmuch smaller stocks - in the Czech Republic it was 9.4\nper cent, and in Hungary only 1 per cent.* An outside\nobserver might find the situation enviable; the Polish\nreader sees in these statistics only an image of a useless\ncooperative swamp.\n\nDreams of a new housing cooperative movement,\nsuch as the implementation of individual examples of\nbuilding groups that would act as “urban acupuncture”,\nwill not come true until we deal with the cumbersome\ninheritance of the previous system. Urban planners\nand activists dodge the subject even in the sphere of\nlanguage: when talking about cooperatives, they limit\nthemselves to one segment of the issue and to one - in\nfact, the most exclusive — investment model. And yet\nmillions of Poles still live in cooperative flats. With-\nout judging whether the latter are the noble legacy of\nsocialism, or the cursed legacy of a system based on\ncorruption, we need to ask ourselves what to do with\nthis: repair the system, or finally eliminate it?\n\nPath to glory\nPoles created housing cooperatives already before the\nFirst World War. In the 1890s, the cooperative move-\nment was active in the part of Polish territory that had\nbeen annexed by Prussia: the first organizations started\noperating in Bydgoszcz, Poznan and Torun. In the\ninterwar period, the Warsaw Housing Cooperative was\nestablished, extremely progressive both socially and\narchitecturally. Many buildings were constructed in the\nformula of building cooperatives created by the wealthy\npart of the society. And yet the cooperative model did\nnot dominate the market of new apartments; it did not\neven gain a significant share in that market, despite the\n\n93 BY THEMSELVES, FOR THEMSELVES\n\nfact that already existing organizations survived World\nWar II. By the end of the 1940s, they managed to com-\nplete the construction of the Koto II and Praga I estates\nin Warsaw, which had started before the war.\n\nIt soon turned out that the new authorities wanted\nto take control of all areas of the economy; therefore,\nany kind of social activities were placed on the list of\nsuspects. The established Zaktad Osiedli Robotniczych\n(National Unit of Workers’ Estates) had a monopoly on\nthe construction and distribution of apartments, while\nthe role of the cooperatives was limited to managing the\npre-existing housing stock.\n\nThe 1950s brought the “Thaw”. Apart from state-\nowned flats, the needs of the population were now to\nbe met also by individual and cooperative housing. The\nconstitution of 1952 even stated that “for the sake of the\ngood of the families, the Polish People’s Republic strives\nto improve the housing situation; with the participation\nof citizens, it develops and supports various forms of\nhousing, especially cooperative housing, and cares for\nthe rational management of housing resources.”5 Three\ntypes of cooperatives were established: tenant coopera-\ntives (their members had a non-transferable right to the\napartments, which meant that they could not transfer it\nto another person), construction and housing coopera-\ntives (they ensured a limited property, transferable and\n\n€\nStegny Estate in Warsaw, constructed in the\n1970s, now forms part of MSM \"Energetyka\".\nAlmost half of its area is green space.

We owe it not so much to legislation as to public\nfunding, which continued until the 1980s. The own\ncontribution for tenants’ flats was 10 per cent, whereas\nfor construction flats, it was 20 per cent. Low-interest\nstate loans were granted for a period of sixty years, and\nsubsidies were sufficient to cover up to 40 per cent of\nthe construction costs. As a result, until the 1990s, the\naverage family’s housing expenditure remained below\n5 per cent of the household budget.\n\nThe distribution of finances made it possible to\ncontrol the selection of program beneficiaries. A 40 per\ncent quota for manual workers was established, which\nmade cooperative membership a mass phenomenon.\nWith time, especially after the complete cessation of\nmunicipal construction in the mid-1970s, some (possi-\nbly as many as half) of all completed flats did not go to\nthose on the official waiting list; instead, they were dis-\ntributed at the discretion of local authorities to adminis-\ntrative staff and service employees of large state-owned\nenterprises. The number of cooperative members who\nneeded an apartment consistently exceeded the number\nof the lucky ones who actually got one. According to sta-\ntistics from 1984, one-third of the applicants had been\non the waiting lists for more than ten years, and it was\ncommon practice to open a housing savings passbook\nfor a new-born baby.®\n\n \n\n94 ZOFIA PIOTROWSKA\n\nCentral budget management made it possible to\nimpose architectural and urban solutions - there were\nstandards and construction systems using the prefabri-\ncated panel technology. An unquestionable advantage\nwas the integrated planning of housing estates with\nsocial infrastructure, and the collaboration of public\ninstitutions with housing cooperatives. On the other\nhand, this also made it possible for buildings to be\nerected on land with an unregulated ownership status,\nwhich continues to generate many problems today.\n\nNeedless to say, such use of public finances inevi-\ntably led to an economic recession in the long run. In\nthe 1980s, funds for the construction of apartments\nwere significantly reduced, although only one impor-\ntant new provision was introduced in the legislation\n— namely, it became possible to establish land and\nmortgage registers for limited property rights (i.e. for\ncooperative ownership apartments), which could be\nmortgaged from then on. Without public funding, the\ncooperatives stopped building new homes. In the 1990s,\nasharp decline in the number of newly built flats began,\nregardless of the type of the investor. In 1992, the last\nyear before the collapse, the cooperatives still managed\nto build eighty thousand flats (63 per cent of all new\nconstruction); today they build only three thousand flats\nper year.”\n\nThe constitution of 1997 incorporates a policy that\nfavours satisfying the housing needs of citizens, in\nparticular counteracting homelessness, supporting\nthe development of social housing and activities of\n\ncitizens aimed at obtaining their own apartment. The\nAct of 2000 implements this policy through the right\n\nto purchase tenant flats and legally separate them into\nisolated properties. Cooperatives can conduct real estate\ndevelopment activities and the profit made on those\nactivities can be invested towards the renovation and\nmaintenance of the existing housing stock.\n\nA public image of cooperative\n\nmovement\nDespite the changes introduced at the turn of the twen-\ntieth and twenty-first centuries, which were unfavoura-\nble and inconsistent with the ideas of social cooperation\nand joint ownership, housing cooperatives are not seen\nto be the victims of the system. They are still perceived\nas privileged institutions that have found a comfortable\ncorner in the current legal reality.

The Housing Europe federation brings together\nentities involved in public and social housing, and\none of them is the Auditing Union of Housing Coop-\neratives of the Republic of Poland (Zwiazek Rewizyjny\nSpotdzielni Mieszkaniowych RP). The “cooperative\nlobby” should encompass the existing organizations as\nwell as the future cooperative movement, representing\nthe interests of both members and management boards.\nOtherwise, it will continue to be perceived as a herd of\nCEO’s friends and relations.\n\nThe principle of concern for the local\n\ncommunity\nHousing cooperatives are still actively pursuing cultural\nand social functions — they run residents’ clubs and\nlocal community centres or collaborate with founda-\ntions that conduct this type of activity. This “old school”\nendeavour is a positive heritage of the People’s Republic\nof Poland, and should be preserved and supported.\n\nMany housing cooperatives, especially those man-\n\naging complexes of blocks of flats, also manage public\ngreen areas, which are used by both their own members\nand residents of other, newly erected buildings, even\n\nthough the latter do not contribute financially to their\nmaintenance. The real estate development activity of\ncooperatives, consisting in irreversible privatization of a\npart of the common resources, reinforces this phenome-\nnon even further.\n\nThe social dimension of a cooperative may also man-\nifest itself in an individual approach to its members,\nalso in the dimension of settling receivables. Already at\nthe moment, some cooperatives offer the possibility of\nreplacing the flat with a smaller one with the financial\ncompensation used to repay the debt. Flexible adapta-\ntion of flat sizes to the changing needs of owners within\nthe same neighbourhood is a response to the problem of\nelderly people trapped in too large apartments, which\nare expensive to maintain.\n\nCooperatives’ greatest strength comes from their\nability to create a holistic picture of the living environ-\nment - including infrastructure, community, green\nspaces, and cultural activities. Despite many barriers\nand irregularities in the Polish system, comprehensive\nmanagement of the housing stock is a value cherished in\nmany housing estates. Separation into individual prop-\nerties would result in the loss of this asset.\n\nNew rules\nThe present ruling party, Law and Justice (Prawo i\nSprawiedliwosé, PiS), became interested in coopera-\ntives (as well as in many previously forgotten matters\nrelated to housing). In 2017, the first law strengthening\nmembership rights was adopted, and there are plans\nto introduce direct elections and rotation in office for\nmanagement boards. The Ministry of Development,\nLabour and Technology also proposes new forms of\nco-financing for cooperative investments as part of\na multi-faceted housing support program. Before we\nbegin to praise the present government, however, let us\nwait for this concern to turn into reality. As the fate of\nthe never-passed large re-privatization act has shown,\nPiS is better at diagnosing problems than implementing\nspecific solutions.\n\n“The latest idea of the Ministry of Development,\nLabour and Technology is a very fine diagnosis, pre-\ndicting a half-hearted action. Still, any move towards\nrestoring the idea of housing cooperatives in Poland\ndeserves recognition,” lawyer and journalist Patryk\nStowik believes.?°\n\nSo far, the topic of two million cooperative flats has\nnot emerged in the discussion on the availability of\nhousing. The activists’ efforts are focused on developing\nthe idea of building societies. And although the latter\ncertainly constitute a valuable city-forming tool, they\nwill always remain but a small-scale activity, dedicated\nto people in a comfortable financial situation.\n\nThe Micro Cooperative (Mikrospétdzielnia),\nlaunched ten years ago by Maciej Czeredys and Piotr\n\n99 BY THEMSELVES, FOR THEMSELVES\n\nTopinski, was an attempt to implement a slightly dif-\nferent vision. The originators wished to build a house\nwhose residents would remain co-owners of the entire\nproperty with the right to lease individual units. This\nwould ensure that the organization would continue as a\nsocial resource regardless of changing tenants. Several\nyears’ work led to the creation of an organizational\nframework necessary for the implementation of the\nventure. Although the project was guided by the idea of\ncooperation, its proponents decided not to incorporate\nunder the cooperative law. The limited liability company\nmodel was chosen - because it is an uncomplicated legal\nform, and it does not require tons of documentation and\nby-laws. The biggest obstacles to obtaining commercial\ncredit were the company’s lack of experience in con-\nducting similar investment projects, and the tenants,\nwho would become a problem in the event of the bank\ntaking over the building. Ultimately, a financing model\nwas developed not in the form of a mortgage credit but a\nleasing contract; the building would remain the prop-\nerty of the bank until the loan is repaid.\n\nThe implementation of the project was thwarted by\nthe city’s land-plot sale system. Warsaw city’s tender\nprocedure requires the winner to deliver the cash\nquickly (although in practice the deadlines may be\nextended, it is difficult to base the success of an invest-\nment venture on an uncertain decision of officials); thus,\nit gives preference to capital groups, and discriminates\nagainst entities, which use sources of financing that\nrequire a longer time frame. In the end, all the plots\nindicated by the Micro Cooperative in discussions with\nofficials (including the plot at number 4 in Sprzeczna\nStreet) were bought by commercial investors.\n\nThe city also pursues a policy of merging small plots\ninto large construction areas, ultimately discrediting\nsmall entities, and destructive to healthy city-forming\nprocesses. We need to emphasize that the problems\nof the Micro Cooperative did not arise from the city’s\noperation on a commercial basis, either in terms of\ncredit-granting or the price of the plot (small and large\nplots are sold at the same price per square meter).

Puskas Aréna, opened in 2019, is one of the\nnewest and most modern European stadiums and it cost\nHungarian taxpayers some 567 million euros. Viktor\nOrban clearly decided that rather than enter uncertain\nwaters, it would be better to stick to the tried and tested\nauthoritarian approach of “bread and circuses” — sup-\nport of football infrastructure is among his key invest-\nments. The announced renovation and construction of\nseveral dozen other stadiums (the first of which, as coin-\ncidence would have it, in Orban’s home village) could\ncost up to 598 million euros, some sources claim.\n\nWhile the construction of one of Budapest’s new\nlandmarks swallowed up vast sums, the city around it\nis falling into an increasingly pressing housing crisis,\nwhich is, in some respects, the worst in the European\nUnion. Rents have more than doubled over the course of\nthe last ten years and property prices have grown by up\nto a hundred and eighty per cent in some districts.\n\nIn lucrative locations, a square metre goes for as\nmuch as four thousand euros. In Hungary, over thirty\nper cent of all households spend over half their income\non housing, and in Budapest, the number is even high-\ner.! According to Eurostat, quoted by the Hungarian\nNational Bank in its report on the housing market, the\nHungarian capital is the fourth worst in unaffordable\nhousing in the EU - after Paris, Prague, and Bratislava.”\nHungary also regularly leads European tables regard-\ning the number of people living in inadequate condi-\ntions. Though the situation has improved considerably\nover the last few years, Hungary is still fifth, following\nRomania, Latvia, Bulgaria, and Poland.

    "Page_104": "Before 1989, almost 50 per cent of Budapest’s apart-\nments were owned by the city, but tenants also had\ncertain proprietary rights. “As a tenant, I could exchange\nmy apartment for another, or even change rental hous-\ning for ownership. The price at which these exchanges\ntook place were around 50 per cent of the market price,”\nsays the sociologist and economist Jozsef Hegedtis\nfrom the Metropolitan Research Institute (MIT). “It\nwas essentially a grey economy transferred into official\nwaters. According to our research, some 30 per cent of\npeople in the 1980s acquired housing in this manner.”\n\nAs early as the 1980s, Hungary became relatively\nliberal in the context of the Eastern Bloc - among other\nthings, the privatisation of housing began before the fall\nof the regime. Fifty thousand apartments were priva-\ntised before 1989 and the process continued after the\nrevolution. Hungarian privatisation, or rather restitu-\ntion, was different from the Czech case in that it was\nnot possible to receive an entire house (with tenants\nincluded), but only individual housing units. The\nprevious owners could apply for compensation, but this\nwasn't very high.\n\nAs a result of these factors, the rental housing sector\nin Hungary is highly non-transparent and unregulated.\n“We have virtually no data - we don’t know who’s rent-\ning what to whom and for how much, it usually takes\nplace on an unofficial basis,” says Hegedtis as he tries\nto explain the local system. This leads to a great uncer-\ntainty on both sides, but particularly for tenants, who\ncan lose their accommodation very easily. “But I’ve also\nheard of many cases in which the tenant did not pay\nrent and the landlord had to pay him to leave the apart-\nment,” continues the sociologist. “This disorganised\nsituation is convenient for many people and interest\ngroups. But our institute proposes at least partial regula-\ntion,” he adds. O\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMunicipal property continued to be sold off in recent\nyears, even as property and rent prices skyrocketed.\nAccording to the 2019 Annual Report on the Housing\nCrisis in Hungary, in 2017, another 536 apartments in\nBudapest were privatised.*\n\nHousing benefit. Decent families\n\nwith children only, please\nAfter the year 2000, as the economy grew, mortgages in\nforeign currencies (usually in euros and Swiss francs)\nwith floating interest rates became very popular among\nHungarians. The cheaper they were, however, the risk-\nier. This was confirmed in 2008, when a mortgage crisis\nbroke out, closely followed by a global economic crisis.\nHungary was one of the most severely affected states\n~ the state debt was over 70 per cent of the GDP and\nHungarian households owed over six billion euros. Two\nyears later, the economic and political crisis gave rise to\nViktor Orban as the country’s leader.\n\n“That was perhaps the first time housing became a\ntopic of discussion across society — the crisis affected\nhundreds of thousands of people across all classes,\nincluding the richest,” explains Csaba Jelinek. “It took\nyears before we got out of the crisis, but it didn’t give\nrise to any public support for housing. Or at least\nnot in a form that would truly help the social groups\nmost in need,” he remarks. Though the government cre-\nated a programme to increase the birth rate and support\neconomic growth, within which it offers families with\nchildren subsidies and loans for housing, in order to be\neligible for these funds, you must conform to a number\nof criteria, including a certain income level and a clean\ncriminal record. “This support therefore doesn’t make\nits way to the poor families at risk, but is mostly reserved\nfor the financially secure middle classes,” says Jelinek.\nThe system therefore ultimately aids the increasing\ndifferences between various social groups.\n\nThirty years after the revolution, the city’s housing stock\nrepresents only about 6 per cent of all the apartments in\n\nBudapest. Just like in other post-communist cities, the city\ntherefore has limited options for supporting affordable housing\nand protecting its inhabitants from the negative impacts of finan-\n\ncialisation and gentrification.\n\n4  K.Amon et al., Annual Report on Housing\nPoverty in Hungary - executive summary,\nBudapest: Habitat for Humanity Hungary,\n2019, https://habitat.hu/sites/lakhatasi-jelen-\ntes/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/01/\nHFH2019EN_V2.pdf (accessed: 25.03.2021).\n\n5 New Residency, https://newresidency.com/\nprograms/hungarian-real-estate-residency-\n-program (accessed: 26.03.2021).\n\n102 ALZBETA MEDKOVA\n\nIn Budapest, the governmental programme had\na further negative impact - some 40 per cent of all\nfamilies that received the housing benefit did not use\nthe money to acquire housing in the metropolis, instead\nopting for a house in one of the urban agglomerations\nsurrounding Budapest. This strengthened the generally\ncriticised trend of suburbanisation. The government\nitself admitted a partial failure, especially after the\nprogramme and the dire situation became the point\nof critique from the Hungarian National Bank, as the\n\nextreme rise in housing prices began endangering the\nentire financial market.\n\nWe (don’t) want foreigners\n\nin Hungary\n“Unaffordable housing has always been an issue for the\npoor. But today, it is also an issue for the middle classes,\nincluding the well-educated younger generations,” says\nAron Horvath, an economist at ELTINGY, the Centre for\nProperty Research at E6étvés Lorand University. “Most\nof our students spend some time at universities abroad.\nThey would then like to return, but more and more\noften, I hear that when they compare the costs of living,\nmoving back here simply isn’t worth it,” explains Hor-\nvath. “Housing prices are lower in Dutch or British cities\n(except London), and they often have the opportunity to\nget better work for better money there.” O\n\nEveryone agrees that\nwithout the help of their\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfamilies, young people simply\ncannot find housing here.",
    "Page_105": "Insufficient availability of municipal rental apartments,\nthe unregulated private sector, unsystematic state sup-\nport, and also the slim offer of affordable private hous-\ning, along with the typically Eastern European desire\nfor home ownership at any cost all contribute to the fact\nthat over 40 per cent of Hungarians between the ages of\n25 and 34 live with their parents. And all these factors\ncontinue driving prices up.\n\nIn Budapest, there is the added element of the attrac-\ntiveness of the centre for Hungarian and international\ninvestors and the large number of apartments used for\nshort-term tourist rentals. On top of that, property is\nincreasingly being acquired as an investment. “Housing\nhas become a commodity. The upper middle class and\nthe wealthy are now investing much more in housing\nthan in the stock market. And again, that contributes\nto the creation of social inequality, which has grown\nconsiderably in past decades,” says Jozsef Hegediis. It\nis not only the local elites who are storing their money\nin property — there are foreign investors too, and this\ndespite the fact that Hungary’s leadership continues to\nclaim that it is restricting the influence of foreigners and\nforeign powers in the country. O\n\n \n\n103\n\nBUDAPEST\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOrban’s regime influences (not only) the housing policy of\nthe city to a much greater extent than is commonly found in\n\nthe state—capital city relationship elsewhere in Europe. Though we\ncould describe the official discourse as neoliberal dogma, Orban’s\ngovernment is also strengthening the position of the state, which\nsome experts interpret as the sign of a centralist system.\n\nBut Csaba Jelinek describes the current Hungarian\nsystem as merely another form of neoliberalism, linked\nto elements of authoritarianism and economic nation-\nalism. “As for housing policy, the central position is\nstill that the state should not interfere too much; that\nit is not the role of the state to build houses,” explains\nJelinek. Even the family subsidies mentioned above\naren’t provided by the state directly — banks are used\nas intermediaries. “What we had before was classic\nneoliberalism: we have to privatize, even though the\nones privatising and investing were generally foreign-\ners. Then Orban introduced the idea that they had to be\nreplaced by Hungarians, so he gave the local oligarchs\nmuch greater power.”\n\nBut most development projects, especially in the\ncentre of Budapest, involve investors from abroad.\nJelinek claims that we can assume many of them are\nprofiting from good political relationships. Aron Hor-\nvath speaks of the old government programme, The\nHungarian Investor Residency Bond Program, in which\nforeign nationals could receive Hungarian citizenship\nin return for an investment over a certain sum. The\nprogramme was mostly popular with the Chinese and\ncitizens from the Middle East. “I don’t think it was a\ncompletely transparent programme. Hundreds of apart-\nments were sold to foreign investors this way,” claims\nHorvath. Though this programme has been terminated,\nit was replaced by another, focused directly on the\nproperty market: the Hungarian Real Estate Residency\nProgram. “The residency permit will be based on the\nprofit of your real estate investment. The simplest way\nto acquire it is to purchase at least two apartments in\nBudapest and rent them out with the aim of generating\nprofit,” we read on the website of the New Residency\ncompany, which organises the programme. All you need\nto get is a residency permit for you and your family is\nan investment of at least two hundred thousand euros\nin “one of the most dynamically developing real estate\nmarkets in the European Union.”5\n\nFerenc Puskas Stadium in\nBudapest with a panoramic\nview of the city\n\nPhoto: OD Pictures / Wikimedia\nCommons CC A-SA 4.0\n\nHead to head\nWandering around Budapest, you don’t exactly feel like\nyou're in a real estate dream. The tattered buildings\nare beautiful and they possess a romantic charm, but\nI doubt their tenants feel just as charmed. Solutions to\nthe sorry state of the housing stock and making hous-\ning more available are some of the priorities of the new\nleadership of the city. The opposition won the autumn\n2019 municipal elections, Gergely Karacsony from the\nDialogue party became mayor, and the opposition also\nformed governing coalitions in many city districts. The\nruling party’s failure in local elections, however, meant\nit fortified its centralising tendencies, further limiting\nthe cities’ autonomy. The government is primarily\ntrying to limit budgets. This year’s pandemic was a\nwelcome pretext that allowed the government to confis-\ncate large sums from cities’ budgets as part of extensive\nextraordinary measures. The eighth and ninth district,\nfor instance, where the housing crisis in Budapest is at\nits worst, lost hundreds of millions of forints intended\nfor the renovation of municipal apartments and aid for\npoor families, as reported by Balkan Insight.\n\nAlthough the city hall now has at its disposal a\nproposal for the city’s housing policy from 2020 to\n2030 developed by MIT, Balint Misetics, an expert on\nsocial policy and housing and an advisor to Budapest’s\ncity hall, points out that it is unclear how much of the\nproposal will be carried through and enforced. The core\nof the institute’s plan lies in broadening the segment\nof available rental housing in three basic ways: through\nbetter and more effective care for the current housing\nstock, by establishing a non-profit agency to administer\nthe municipal housing stock and expand it, and through\nsupport of alternative forms of ownership (condomini-\nums, cooperatives, and others). If the city were to follow\nthis strategy, the proportion of municipal or agency\nhousing would rise to 12 per cent, up to 30 per cent in\nthe long-term. At this stage, however, all these are just\nproposals on paper.\n\nWhere do the poor go?\nAfter the coronavirus outbreak, most tourists disap-\npeared from Budapest, so thousands of apartments used\nfor short-term rentals returned to the market and rental\ncosts decreased slightly. Regulating tourist rentals was",
    "Page_106": "one of the central tenets of Karacsony’s programme, to\nwhich end the mayor met with Airbnb representatives\nshortly after last year’s election. “That was more a dip-\nlomatic meeting to clarify our respective positions — we\ndidn’t have a legislative tool to limit this type of rentals,”\nexplains Misetics.\n\nAugust 2020, however, saw the ratification of an\namendment of a trade law that gives local politicians\nthe right to restrict short-term rentals, most directly\nregarding the number of days for which apartments can\nbe rented this way. In Budapest, however, this decision\nis not up to the city hall but to individual city districts.\n“Airbnb is lobbying against the new regulations and\nwe're trying to get the municipalities to cooperate and\nunify the rules as much as possible,” says Misetics. “In\nany case, apartments should only be rented for short-\nterm rentals for a smaller part of the year from now on.”\n\nAirbnb and other platforms often state that only\nabout ten to fifteen thousand apartments in Budapest\nare used for short-term rentals, i.e. about 1 per cent, so\ntourist rentals have no impact on the cost and availabil-\nity of housing. “This is a highly misleading statement.\nBudapest is a large city, and of its twenty-three districts,\nonly about seven are affected by this phenomenon,” says\nMisetics. “In the central districts, it might well be more\nthan half of all apartments, perhaps even three quar-\nters.”\n\nEspecially in the centre, recent years have seen the\nprogression of gentrification processes that have been\nhardest on the city’s poorest inhabitants. The central\nareas on the Pest side (where the parliament is) are\nnow lucrative and popular with tourists. Traditionally,\nhowever, the central districts of Budapest were working\nclass, poor, with a high percentage of Roma population,\nand highly socially stigmatised. The relocation of the\noriginal inhabitants has been taking place since 1989,\nbut it gathered speed particularly in the past decade.\n“Thanks to the fact that only individual apartments\ncould be restituted and privatised, a highly specific\nmosaic-like ownership structure was created here, and\nit didn’t allow investors to buy entire houses or blocks,”\nexplains Csaba Jelinek. “In this respect, we’re lucky\ncompared to Prague, because this prevented the quick\ndisplacement of the inhabitants and the transformation\nof the centre into a Disney Land park. But investors find\na way, of course.”\n\nA right to dignity\nFollowing a recommendation from journalist Eszter\nNeuberger, who focuses on social issues and hous-\ning, I visit Hés Utca, the location of one of Budapest’s\nfamous socially excluded districts, stigmatised by the\nmainstream media as a hub for a variety of negative\n\nsocial phenomena. In reality, it\n\nis home to dozens of families,\n\nALZBETA MEDKOVA\n\nmostly Roma, who have the “good fortune” — for now -\nto live in these houses (though they are falling apart),\nand not in tents in the park or beyond the city borders.\nAccording to public opinion, a walk through Hés Utca\nwould likely be dangerous for my health, but I wouldn’t\nreally have noticed I was walking through a “problem\ndistrict” if I hadn’t been alerted to this fact in advance.\nThe only sign of social exclusion is the sorry state of\nthe houses, but that is nothing uncommon in Buda-\npest. Poverty strikes the eye even harder in a city where\nhundreds of millions of euros are being invested in giant\ndevelopment projects.\n\nThe surroundings of Puskas Ferenc Stadion under-\nground station, where I board my train back to the\ncentre, are full of homeless people and others clearly\nfrom the poorest strata of society. This tableau is typical\nof all the metropolises of the world, but I meet many\nmore poor and begging people in Budapest than in,\nsay, Prague, and not just at the central transport nodes.\nAccording to Jozsef Hegedtisz, some 15 per cent of Hun-\ngarians can be described as very poor, but another 70\nper cent represents classes in precarious circumstances,\nwith no security they won’t lose their job or apartment,\nleading to serious problems.\n\nI give the rest of my cash to an older gentleman\nplaying the guitar on the dirty tiles in an underpass. He\nlooks like he might have been teaching high school Eng-\nlish just last week. Perhaps he still has a job, but it’s no\nlonger enough to live off. I have nothing left for the pen-\nsioner sitting at the other exit, so I avert my eyes. After\na few days in Budapest, one can hardly avoid thinking\nabout the banal but crucial fact that here, poverty is\nrobbing people of one of the most valuable things they\nhave - their dignity. e\n\nEnglish translation: lan Mikyska",

This growth wasn’t\nslowed even by the coronavirus epidemic — though the\nreal estate market seemed to stop for a moment in April,\nit began a process of renewal as early as May, so the\nsecond quarter displayed a growth of one and a half per\ncent compared to the first. This July, the average price of\nthe apartments on offer rose to a record 3,500 euros per\nsquare metre, signifying a yearly increase of 17 per cent,\nas reported by Bencont Investments in their regular\nmarket analysis.3\n\nNo parents, please!\nThe average price of rent has decreased slightly since\n2019, when it reached a peak of 12.3 euros per m? per\nmonth. Unlike Prague, where the price drop in 2020 was\nmostly related to a decrease in short-term rent, Bratisla-\nva’s decline is related to fewer apartments being built in\nnewly built properties, where rents are generally higher.\nPrices per square metre are therefore between 11.5 and 12\neuros in both cities. O\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRecently, the media have paid considerable atten-\ntion to the dismal situation in Bratislava. Just like in the\nCzech Republic, the reports often claim that the high\nprices are a result of the small number of apartments\navailable and the slow bureaucratic process accompa-\nnying development. Developers continue claiming that\nif they could build without regulations, prices would\n“naturally” go down.\n\nRepresentatives of the city — including Sergej Kara\n— agree that there really aren’t enough apartments and\nthat the permission process on the level of the city\nand its individual districts is extremely slow. However,\nmerely speeding them up will not bring prices down.\nTerms such as “financialisation” and “investment hous-\ning” appear minimally in the Slovak public debate, and\nyet they have a crucial influence on housing. The global\ncontext is thus virtually absent from the Slovak debate,\nas is the local context. And in Bratislava, local condi-\ntions have a determining influence on housing costs.\n\nIn Slovakia, as in other countries in Central and Eastern\nEurope, rental housing is considered a temporary solution\n\nto a personal emergency. Even in the Bratislava Region, where\nthe ratio of people renting accommodation is the highest in all of\nSlovakia, only around 11 per cent of the population pay rent.\n\nGenerally, however, rent prices have gone up in pre-\nvious years (some ten to fifteen per cent between 2018\nand 2019), and, according to the experts, will continue\nrising.\n\nMany people living in Bratislava are therefore caught\nin a difficult situation — there aren’t enough free apart-\nments, prices are extortionate, so one must take on con-\nsiderable debt in order to buy an apartment, and many\npeople will not be given mortgages and other loans.\nThere are also insufficient rental apartments and rent\nprices are going up just as quickly. “If demand is higher\nthan supply, landlords can begin to choose,” notes Sergej\nKara, plenipotentiary of the mayor for social housing\nand people experiencing homelessness. “And I’m not\ntalking about skin colour, that’s a topic in itself. Discrim-\nination of this kind affects parents, particularly single\nparents, as landlords will opt for someone less econom-\nically risky.” A single parent of one child who works ina\nchain store is left with only eight euro a day after paying\naverage commercial rent, as Kara and his colleagues\ndemonstrated at the exhibition mentioned above. It is\na straightforward deduction that if people spend most\nof their income on housing - and this is the case for an\nenormous number of people in Slovakia - they are all\nthe more threatened by losing their accommodation in\nany exceptional circumstances.\n\n107 BRATISLAVA\n\nMunicipal apartments? One per\ncent of the market\n“Since 1994, the city of Bratislava has let go some 67,000\napartments. We currently have less than two thousand\nhousing units at our disposal,” explains Kara. About\na thousand apartments are administered directly by\nthe city hall and the rest is in the care of various city\ndistricts. O\n\n \n\nThis means the city owns\nonly one per cent of all\nthe apartments in Bratislava,\nand is therefore essentially\nincapable of exerting any influ-\nence on rent prices. For com-\nparison: in Vienna, the figure\n\nis 6O per cent, in Brno, 15 per\ncent, and in Prague, only 5 per\ncent. If the Slovak metropo-\n\nlis hadn’t sold off its assets, it\nwould now be able to influence\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrent prices in almost a third of\nall the apartments in the city\n\nThe city’s housing stock is an important instrument\nfor maintaining an acceptable price range and thus\nkeeping the city socially diverse and functional. If the\ncity has no such tool at its disposal, it becomes much\nmore difficult to maintain even the previously stable\nmiddle class, as well as helping poorer classes, people\nin housing need, or people experiencing homelessness.\n“The city should own not only apartments for single par-\nents, older people, or people in need, but also for neces-\nsary professions such as teachers and social workers,”\nthinks Lucia Stasselova (SPOLU), deputy of the mayor\nfor social issues. “Bratislava does not have enough of\nthese people, simply because they struggle so much to\nfind accommodation and keep it,” she adds.\n\nA lack of apartments everywhere\nBratislava is no exception in Slovakia. The privatisation\nand selling off of property took place on a much more\nmassive scale than in the Czech Republic, and there are\neven cities like Zilina, which disposed of absolutely all\nof its apartments. And, bar exceptions, no new munici-\npal housing was built. There are also many cases of cities\nkeeping part of their housing stock but not using or car-\ning for the apartments. In recent years, with the onset\nof the global housing crisis, however, cities are realising\nmore and more that they need their own housing stock.\n\nBratislava’s current liberal government, led by the\narchitect Matu8 Vallo since the 2018 communal elec-\ntion, wants to reverse the trend of selling off municipal\nproperty. Vallo’s bid for mayor was portrayed as a civic\ncandidate leading a team of experts called Team Vallo\n~— who prepared an ambitious vision for the general\ndevelopment of the metropolis, Plan Bratislava -, with\nthe support of the centrist liberal movement Progresivne\nSlovensko (Progressive Slovakia) and the liberal-\nconservative party SPOLU (TOGETHER). The ruling\ncoalition wants to extend the urban housing capacity in\nseveral ways. “We've got our eye on some unused prop-\nerties belonging to the city that could be renovated and\ntransformed into rental housing,” explains Lucia Stasse-\nlova. “We’re also negotiating with state institutions and\nthe Bratislava Region, who have empty buildings in the\ncity, about transferring or buying these properties,” con-\ntinues the deputy. According to Stasselova, this could\nlead to the acquisition of up to two hundred apartments.\n\n3 “Ani doéasné zastavenie dopytu po nehnu-\ntel'nostiach ceny bytov v Bratislave neovplyv-\nnilo”, Kvartdlna analyza realitného trhu 2020,\nkv. 2, https://www.bencont.sk/app/cmsSite-\n-Attachment.php?ID=290&disposition=inline\n(accessed: 25.03.2021).",
    "Page_110": "Most importantly, the municipal authorities are\nrestarting construction after years of inactivity. In addi-\ntion to the reasons listed above, there is a further moti-\nvation: the law on restitutions. In buildings that were\nreturned to their original owners after the collapse of the\ncommunist regime in 1989, rent is regulated and the city\nhas to compensate the difference between the regulated\nrent and market-value rent. This costs the city two mil-\nlion euro every year. Furthermore, the law states that the\ncity is obliged to find substitute rental apartments for\nabout five hundred tenants in restituted houses.\n\nNot in my backyard!\nSeen from the castle view, Bratislava looks a little like a\ncity put together by children at an architecture work-\nshop looking to test out all the approaches that took\nplace in various European cities over the preceding\ncenturies. In the 1970s, the old town, with its crooked\npaths and cathedral, was ripped apart by the huge arte-\nrial road and the SNP Bridge, crowned by the iconic UFO\nbuilding. The distant horizon is lined by wind turbines\nand the chimneys of old gasworks. O\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nin their neighbourhood. “People usually support the\nconstruction of new municipal housing - anywhere\nexcept near their home,” agrees Stasselova. The city\n\nhall is therefore organising participative meetings in\nselected localities, and, according to Stasselova, they\nhave been successful in convincing the inhabitants of\nneighbouring properties that municipal apartments will\nnot be detrimental to their quality of life. A distaste for\nmunicipal development is also rooted in the stereotypes\nabout rental housing mentioned above. “People often\nthink that problematic individuals will inhabit these\nhouses. Though a few apartments will be set apart for\npeople in greatest need, most of them will be aimed\n\nat young families, seniors, nurses, policemen, and the\nlike,” explains the mayor’s deputy.\n\nThe most developed project so far is a group of\nhouses on the opposite end of the city, in Terchovska\nStreet in the district of RuZinov. The city organised an\narchitectural competition along with the Metropolitan\nInstitute, established in April 2019. The Czech studio\nThe Biiro won the commission and negotiations about\nthe contract are currently taking place. Here too, the\n\nHowever, we need only to turn our heads slightly and we'll\nsee an unlikely view: directly in the historical centre are sev-\n\neral skyscrapers, towering dozens of metres into the air as con-\nsumerist counterweights to the Cathedral of St Martin. This is the\nNew Bratislava — the Bratislava of the future. At least according to\nits creators, who would very much like to multiply the numbers of\ncathedrals of unbridled capitalism. There must be at least some\ntruth to the saying going around the city - Bratislava today, appar-\nently, is a “Klondike for developers”.\n\nBehind the SNP Bridge is a different “city of tomor-\nrow” - that of the 1970s. The largest housing estate in\nCentral Europe, PetrZalka, is home to almost a quarter\nof all the inhabitants of Bratislava. It is here that the city\nhall has selected several properties on which new rental\nhouses could be built. But the city’s problem is that it\ndisposed of its best properties along with its apartments\nduring the transformation period and it only has small\nplots of land left. “But perhaps this isn’t such a bad\nthing - smaller projects will be easier to accept for the\nlocal inhabitants,” thinks Stasselova. In Bratislava too,\nthe slogan “not in my backyard” is important — locals are\nusually not very happy with the idea of rental housing\n\n4 For current rental regulations in Bratislava, see\nhttps://bratislava.sk/sk/najomne-byty-mesta\n(accessed: 25.03.2021).\n\n108 ALZBETA MEDKOVA\n\nlocals were worried at first, but Stasselova claims they\nhave mostly been assuaged. “At the participative meet-\nings, we don’t just discuss the new constructions but\nalso other problems worrying the locals that we try to\naddress,” she describes the city’s strategy.\n\nThe city hall also wants to acquire new apartments\nthrough collaboration with developers. It is planning to\nmake use of the fact that developers often circumvented\nthe territorial plan, for instance by bypassing housing\ncoefficients. “They built more housing units that was\npermitted in the given area, bypassing the regulations\nby presenting part of the flats as suites, counting these\ninto the category of public amenities,” explains Stasse-\nlova. The city hall has put an end to this practice and\nis negotiating with developers: the plan is that the city\nwill retroactively change these coefficients, the devel-\noper will then be allowed to build more apartments,\nbut part of these will be sold off to the city at cost value.\n\nStasselova claims at least some developers are open to\nthis kind of cooperation.\n\nWe have regulations, but they\n\ndon't correspond to our needs\n“At present, Bratislava only has threatened, more threat-\nened, and the most threatened,” says Sergej Kara about\nthe present situation on the Bratislava housing market.\n“Even the middle class is now among the threatened.\n\nIt is unrealistic for Bratislava to provide housing for all\nthose who need it in the following, say, ten years,” he\nresponds when we asked him who should be selected\nto inhabit the new municipal apartments. The current\nwaiting time is four to seven years. “If someone finds\nthemselves in a difficult situation, God forbid a critical\none, they have no chance to get an apartment regardless\nof whether they conform to the current criteria or not.”\nThe regulations for distributing municipal apartments\ndate back to 2000 and they do not correspond to the\nneeds of today. In 2020, however, the system by which\napartments are allocated should have been reset.4\n\nBefore working at the city hall, Kara worked as a\nsocial field worker and co-founded the Vagus civic initi-\native, aiming to help people experiencing homelessness.\nSocially endangered groups are also his area of expertise\nat the city hall. These groups are not eligible for hous-\ning, even when they have a small income. With the aid\nof experts from Brno, Bratislava is now setting up pilot\nprojects for people in greatest need of housing based\non the principles of Housing First. “It’s a very long path\nbefore we are like Helsinki, where they can aim to erad-\nicate homelessness completely,” Kara muses. “But it’s\nimportant to start naming these issues, as that dictates\npublic policy. This is what we, as responsible people,\nshould be doing.”\n\nCompared to Prague, the Bratislava city hall seems\nmuch more ready for action in carrying through specific\nsolutions. The Bratislava coalition has a much stronger\nposition, and unlike Prague’s, is unified on issues of\nhousing. The comparison yields one more difference:\nwhile in the Czech Republic, similar approaches are\noften considered left-wing and sometimes even “radi-\ncal” (whatever that may mean), in Bratislava, they are\npromoted by centrist and right-wing parties. SPOLU, for\ninstance, Lucia Stasselova’s party, is a political partner\nof TOP 09, the Czech liberal-conservative party. Prague’s\nconservatives could learn a thing or two from their Slo-\nvak colleagues.\n\nHousing equals living\n“Unfortunately, Czechoslovakia and the entire Eastern\nBloc was unlucky in having an ideological rupture ina\nperiod when neoliberalism was already the dominant\nideology around the world,” says Elena Szolgayova, plac-\ning today’s problems in context. More and more experts,",
    "Page_111": "such as sociologist Saskia Sassen, draw attention to the\nfact that as far as housing goes, neoliberalism simply\ndoes not work. “The unavailability of housing grows into\nall sectors of society; it is a factor impacting economic\nand social life. But it’s hard to trace these connections\nfrom a layman’s perspective,” explains Szolgayova. “The\nneoliberal ideological principles of the 1980s left a huge\nmark on the first attempts of post-socialist countries at\napproaching the issue of housing. And it has become\napparent that the more liberal a country’s approach was,\nthe greater the problems it has on its hands today.”\n\n“We subordinate our lives to the housing we can\nafford,” says Michal Janak of the social impact of\nunavailable housing. I met him in the Nova Cvernovka\ncultural centre to discuss how the current crisis impacts\ntwenty- and thirty-year-olds. “Many people live with\npartners they no longer want to be with simply because\nthey cannot afford to live on their own,” he explains.\nAnd it’s not just partners: in Slovakia, some 60 per cent\nof young people live with their parents. The country is\nthe European record holder, tied with Croatia for first\nplace.\n\n \n\nBRATISLAVA\n\nJanak, who works as an architect, also draws atten-\ntion to the part his field can play in formulating societal\nconditions. The prevailing typology of Slovak apart-\nments reflects the normative idea that the inhabitants\nof the apartment are a traditional family. “In Austria, for\ninstance, the apartments under construction right now\nare much more diversified —- adapted for the cohabi-\ntation of several single individuals, for instance,” he\nexplains, describing the Austrian approach as more\ndemocratic.\n\nAccording to Janak, the problem of market mecha-\nnisms is that they narrow the issue down to the greatest\ncommon societal denominator, which can also make\nthe most money. “Today, people over thirty opt for a par-\nticular way of life just to have a roof above their heads,\nand this seems dangerous to me.” His words are a stark\ncontrast to the political slogans that so favour the happy\n- of course, most often also the “traditional” - family.\nPerhaps they will also once come to the realisation that\neven a happy family has to have a dignified place to live.\n\ne\n\nEnglish translation: lan Mikyska\n\nView on Petrzalka\n\ndistrict in Bratislava from the\nSNP bridge\n\nPhoto: Mare Ryckart / Wikime-\ndia Commons CCA 3.0",

    "Page_113": "Mass construction of housing\n\nestates in Bratislava\nAfter World War IL, Bratislava had thirty thousand apart-\nments.! Despite the efforts of progressive architects,\nthe housing stock was largely deprived of sufficient\nsanitary facilities. The city became depopulated, and\nthe socialist regime applied its concept of planning and\ncollectivization - among other things - also to housing\ndevelopment in Czechoslovakia. After the abolition\nof private ownership and the nationalization of land,\nmarket prices ceased to apply, but unrestrained spatial\ndevelopment of cities began: the existing urban struc-\ntures were interfered with or replaced with new build-\nings. Intensive post-war modernization of various areas\nof life was conducive to urbanization, and the planning\nof housing development required the state to create\ninstitutions focused on research, design, and implemen-\ntation of projects.”\n\nThe authorities pushed for quantitative efficiency\nof the construction industry, and the response was an\nintensive development of prefabrication. The rapid\npopulation growth in urban centres commanded the\ncreation of flexible construction companies that would\noffer diversified urban solutions, and at the same time\nwould provide a level of comfort in various types of\napartments in line with modern expectations. Efforts to\nincrease the number of flats have resulted in the prefab-\nrication of several standardized forms of a tower block.\nThe state-financed construction of prefabricated blocks\nof flats responded to the needs of the changing demo-\ngraphic structure of the city — in a period of forty years,\napartments for over three hundred thousand people\nwere built in Bratislava.?\n\nIt is because of this high number that we called it\nmass construction rather than social housing. In a class-\nless society that the socialist regime tried to create, the\nsocially weaker class was simply not meant to be. Mass\nconstruction and the influx of people from other regions\nof Slovakia resulted in breaking the cultural continuity\nof the city.4 Nowadays, while criticizing all that is asso-\nciated with the past regime, we unconsciously reject the\nvaluable urban structures that had been created in that\nera. Iam not driven by nostalgic optimism or the indis-\ncriminating praise for spatial planning of the last cen-\ntury. I merely wish to compare concepts and tendencies\nthat we suppose indifferent to the quality of living today.\nThe centralization of Bratislava’s function as a capital in\nthe last century, and the lack of a motorway connection\nto KoSice, the main metropolis of eastern Slovakia and\nthe second largest city in the country, have led and con-\ntinue to lead to a constant influx of new residents and\na permanent housing shortage. Apartments offered on\nthe market meet only the basic demand, whereas their\nquality and size turn out to be of secondary importance.\nResidential units meet only the minimum requirements\n\nin terms of standards and norms, and they are built as\ncheaply as possible. We are falling into a vicious circle:\nnew residents do not establish ties with the city, and\nthe city does not offer them a living space that would\nfoster a bond. As a result, the immigrants perceive the\nmetropolis only as a source of income, rather than a\nplace to live.\n\nIntensive housing development\n\nyesterday and today\nUntil 1968, mass construction occupied all areas suitable\nfor building housing estates, i.e. flat plots of land, with-\nout spatial barriers or the pre-existing buildings. Subse-\nquently, the constant influx of new residents forced the\ndevelopment of urban projects also in less favourable\nlocations: in hilly terrain, outside the city limits, or\nwithin the existing urban structures. The necessity to\neconomically manage financial resources, the prob-\nlems with operating machinery in more hilly terrain or\nbetween the existing buildings, and arguments related\nto the need of maintaining agricultural land slowed\ndown the development.’ The optimal solution was to\nincrease density of the planned housing estates, but\nurban concepts were often implemented in part only.\nIncreasing the density of buildings continues to this\nday, and is not accompanied by any attempts to draw\nconclusions from previous experiences. The efficiency\nof infrastructure and the provision of services are still\ninadequate compared to the needs of the current and\nfuture residents.\n\nContemporary intensification is not only about\nincreasing the density of urban structures and reducing\nthe amount of green areas. Where the construction of\nunderground car parks seems too expensive, part of the\nland is allocated to aboveground parking lots.\n\nAt the same time, in houses with underground car parks,\nthe layout of the apartments depends on the structure\nof pillars and load-bearing walls of the car park. Exten-\nsions are also built — extra floors added on to the existing\nmulti-family houses.\n\nNew buildings and extensions attempt to meet the\ndemand, but they do not offer comprehensive solutions\nto the problems related to living in the city. Private real\nestate development companies carry out their projects\nmostly in order to sell or rent flats and commercial\nspaces; activities aimed at the development of the city\nas such are outside their purview. They understand their\ncontribution to the city’s development as creating pro-\njects of unique visual quality. In terms of size and inte-\nrior layout, the apartments offered in these buildings are\nbarely within the norm. A walk around Bratislava is like\nwatching an egocentrics’ parade where the combina-\ntion of materials and designs rubs shoulders with tacky\ndetails, soulless emptiness, and a lack of genius loci. The\nlocal government is only gradually developing tools that\n\n111 SLAVES TO PREFABRICATION\n\nwill allow them to compel private developers to include\npublic services — for example schools and kindergartens\n— and the development of public infrastructure in their\ninvestment projects.\n\nAll the above-mentioned processes, combined with\nchanges in the law, have recently caused a disaster\nin the transport infrastructure. Since 2009, the edges of\nthe streets have been littered with cars. Since new law\nallowed parking on pavements in the capital, there has\nbeen practically no space left there for pedestrians. In\naddition, the parking space density index, enshrined in\nthe law, designates the obligatory one parking space per\napartment. The direct effect of the increase of pseudo-\nresidential space was the increase of the number of\npeople who live in Bratislava but are not registered there\nas residents. As a result, the local government ran out\nof financial resources for the city to function like other\nEuropean metropolises.\n\nAt the same time, the inhabitants of the concentrated\ncity of Bratislava have become experts on parking. Hous-\ning estates built in the late 1970s on hilly terrain taught\nthe migrants from lowlands how to park on steep streets.\nIn modern housing estates, people handle it differently:\nthey double park and don’t apply the handbrake. Ifa\ncar is blocked, its driver will simply push away the ones\nthat are blocking it. In addition to allowing time for the\ntypical morning traffic jam, we must therefore add at\nleast half an hour needed to free up or find our own car,\nbecause it could be standing up to two hundred meters\nfrom the place where we parked it a few hours earlier.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, efforts\nto develop efficient and economical buildings resulted\nin prefabricated housing estates. Prefabrication was\ninvented in order to eliminate the wet process - pouring\nconcrete — from the construction site, which was meant\nto speed up the work. The walls were lined with wallpa-\nper, the floors were laid with linoleum. These materials\nwere subject to centralized production and appeared\nin a limited number of patterns, so the unification of\nthe interiors grew even deeper. At that time it was a\nnew technology, the builders were only just learning\n\n1 Compare: H.

    "Page_114": "how to use it, therefore many low-quality houses were\nput into use. In a situation where the architects did\nnot have enough time or financial resources to create\ndetailed documentation regarding the finishing works,\nthe choice of finishing materials and aesthetic solutions\nturned out to be the combined result of the taste of the\nforeman of the construction crew and circumstance.\nAfter collectivization came privatization and free-\ndom of expression. In the 1990s, central planning ended\nand the owners began to make decisions about the\nappearance of their houses. The period of extensions\nand thermal modernization began. The lack of cultural\ncontinuity, the indiscriminate elimination of prefabrica-\ntion from the life of Slovaks, getting rid of prefabricated\nhousing estates and everything that was associated with\ncommunism, combined with the extremely effective\nmarketing of companies dealing with thermal modern-\nization, gave rise to mass trend of painting the uni-\nformed housing estates from the last century. Thermal\ninsulation became an indispensable element of any\nrenovation, a way to improve the quality of housing\nand a showcase product of capitalism. The marketing\nwas based on presenting thermo-modernization as an\ninvestment that would make it possible to save on main-\ntenance costs in the future, but its negative side-effects\nwere ignored (attaching polystyrene to an uneven, brit-\ntle base promotes the appearance of mould; amateurish\nfixing causes the insulation to move away from the wall,\nwhich reduces its effectiveness; shoddy finish does not\ndrain moisture, it collects dust and is an ideal substrate\nfor fungi). The polystyrene insulation system had prac-\ntically been promoted to the rank of a norm in build-\ning renovation. In housing estates, criticized for their\nuniformization, a standardized and simple solution was\nused, which was supposed to be the answer to many\nproblems at once. Thermo-modernization was sold as a\ntreatment to the “trauma of socialism”: the monotonous\nhomogeneity of neighbourhood facades turned\ninto a palette of pastel colours and geometric patterns.\nThis new, fluid identity was created by thermo-\nmodernization companies without aesthetic education,\nby painting crews, and by mere chance. Today’s smooth,\nfaultless, industrially manufactured plasters reflect the\nresidents’ longing for an ideal, carefree world. Yet their\nlives and the interiors of their apartments are many\ncoloured, full of various tones and irregularities. As\nSlovak architect Ivan MatuSik put it: “All things live their\nown lives, including mistakes.” We try to hide the mis-\ntakes behind a false idea of perfection. The apartment\nblock insulated with polystyrene, painted in bright col-\nours, responds to the problems of the post-communist\nsociety. The inhabitants are no longer surrounded by\nthe greyness typical of the past regime, and they feel\n\nthat they can make independent\n\ndecisions about their property,\n\nMARIA NOVOTNA\n\ninvest in it, and adapt it according to their own ideas. In\ndreams of a small investment that would reduce the cost\nof living, confronted with its amateur and low-quality\nworkmanship, we see a reflection of present times and\nthe priorities of contemporary people.\n\nChanging the interior of apart-\n\nments after privatization\nSince the 1960s, the standardized layout of typical\napartments has been enriched with an innovation in the\nform of a prefabricated, complete interior with kitchen\nfurniture and corner dining space. Unified products,\nsuch as Umakart HPL modules,° are difficult to assess\nin terms of aesthetics or quality of the materials and\nobjects used — they were installed in the apartments as a\nresult of centrally planned production. A separate toilet\nis a plus, but due to an unfortunate planning solution,\nit was combined with a walk-through bathroom. This\nsolution provokes reflection on the importance of caring\nfor the body and privacy. Apparently, there was no\nexcessive emphasis on intimacy in the family, and no\ntaboo on nudity.\n\nThe new owners of the privatized flats were eager\nto interfere with the interior layout. In the first place,\nthey usually got rid of the plastic boards and replaced\nthem with masonry structures, and then with drywall\n(plasterboard). Many renovation companies still\noffer the dismantling of Umakart panels. The removal\nof the Umakart bathroom is considered an upgrade that\nincreases the price of an apartment by approximately 10\nper cent.\n\nBefore the introduction of laminated kitchens and\nbathrooms, the socialist regime tried to encourage the\nuse of canteens in schools and workplaces. The kitchen\nand dining room were not considered an essential\npart of the apartment. It was believed that families are\nsatisfied with meals made of semi-finished products,\nand “the modern food industry and collective eateries\nprovide services that have freed working women from\ntiring and unpleasant labour.”’ The kitchens were there-\nfore small, often dark and not ventilated, placed in the\nfarthest corner of the apartment. The departure from\nthe mass nutrition model resulted in the production of\nready-made, prefabricated laminate modules, identical\nin the kitchen, the bathroom and the hall, as well as the\nemerging belief that eating meals together strengthens\nfamily ties. The press in the 1960s clearly appreciated\nnot only the kitchen as a full-fledged room, but also as a\nsymbol of the position of women in society. For the next\nthirty years, kitchens gained large windows and a dining\ncorner. They were situated progressively closer to the\nliving room, later with just a door between them.\n\nWith the advent of capitalism, emancipation and\nprivatization, also this last barrier has disappeared.\n\nThe kitchen has become an inseparable part of the\n\nliving room, whether this was due to the reorganization\nof interiors in the old apartments, or as an integrated\nmodule in new buildings. At the same time, however,\nmodern standards do not treat the kitchen as a living\nroom. It is stuffed into the back of the apartment, where\nthe light from the rooms does not enter, or on one\n\nof the walls of the living room, usually the one farthest\nfrom the window, which further degrades the function\nof the kitchen. This solution does not separate family\nmembers who are preparing the meal from those who\nare spending time in the living room. In new designs\nfor apartments or single-family houses, often offering\n\na typical interior layout, the average size of the kitchen\narea has not increased over the last thirty years. If the\noptimization of the interior layout and the minimization\nof the space — as far as it is possible within the norm\n\n— continues, we will soon have to cook in windowless\nkitchens. Underestimating and disregarding the kitchen\nleads us to the question of whether we still consider\ncooking together as a family to be superfluous, and\nwhether we will be content with the alternatives in the\nform of fast food and semi-finished products offered by\nthe neoliberal system.\n\nThe interior layouts of apartments in tower blocks\nchanged the most in the 1960s, also thanks to prefab-\nricated interior finishing modules. Until the 1960s, it\ncame as no surprise to anyone that the living room also\nserved as a bedroom. The designers of the new housing\nestates had ambitions to raise the standard of flats and\nallocate a separate space for sleep, thus making life\neasier for the residents. There were standards and indi-\ncators for the number of square meters and additional\nspace allocations (a cellar, a storeroom or a basement)\nper tenant. The modern trend of reducing the size of\napartments has led to a situation where basements are\nan above-standard privilege, and entrance corridors are\ndoor-wide. There are doubts as to whether the bedroom\nhas to be a separate room, and in cramped apartments\nthere is often not enough space for a piece of furniture\nthat would be intended only for sleeping. A separate\nbedroom, or even a space where a bed can fit, is now\nconsidered a luxury. The market price of an apartment\nwith a bedroom is now about ten times the price at\nwhich it was built.\n\nApartment on arable land\nIn today’s Bratislava you won’t find any flats for rent\nor social housing.’ People fresh out of college or those\nwho migrate to the city for work sublet apartments from\nprivate owners; therefore, the city does not regulate the\nprice, only the free market does. The continuous growth\nof prices often forces tenants to share a flat. Even if there\nare still some standards and minimum requirements for\nhousing in the designing process, in reality they are not\nbeing followed. Having too many tenants constitutes a",
    "Page_115": "form of intensification; this, in turn, reduces the quality\nof the apartment, but also of the environment. Public\nservices and transportation become inefficient. Traces\nof Slovakia’s centralization and the role of Bratislava\nplayed in the last century are still visible. People from\nthe eastern part of the country are constantly flowing\ninto the capital, and consequently there is a shortage of\nhousing. New residents often spend only their working\ndays in the city, and do not develop a deeper bond with\nit. They are not interested in its history; the cultural\ncontinuity has been broken.\n\nOne element of Bratislava’s identity grew out of the\ndiscontinuity and the random, collage-like urban devel-\nopment. This city consists of a mosaic of (non)urban\nconcepts complemented by a mixture of construction\npermits, assorted new building facades created by vari-\nous architects, extensions, renovations, and old housing\nestates “tweaked” and “upgraded” by thermo-\nmodernization companies. This hybrid is gradually\njoined by satellite housing estates, urban concepts of\nliving in single-family houses on the outskirts of the\ncity. It is difficult to tell whether young families move\nout of the city in order to achieve their dreams of their\nown garden, or whether they are looking for a cheaper\nalternative to living in the capital. Small houses with a\nplot of land in suburban municipalities are roughly 30\nper cent cheaper than similarly sized apartments within\nthe city’s administrative boundaries. However, it is dif-\nficult to speak of the benefits pertaining to the comfort\nof living in a single-family house, the way we used to\nimagine it. Problems are generated by contemporary\nspatial planning, which enables the creation of agglom-\neration clusters. Seemingly they look like a whole, an\nurban organism, but they were created without a plan,\nthey lack services, adequate infrastructure, or public\nspaces: a market square, playgrounds, green areas. Their\ndesigners are selling a compact “American dream”: a\nsingle-family house on a small plot separated from for-\nmer agricultural land, again with the minimum param-\neters required by the housing standards. The advertised\ngarden is in fact limited to a patch of land enclosed by\n\n \n\na tall, prefabricated fence. The immediate proximity\nof the neighbours does not allow you to enjoy the rural\nidyll or the privacy that you desire.\n\nThe standards, which are constantly lowered to\nthe limits of reason, hinder flexibility in designing the\ninterior layout and prevent the use of the potential that\nthe house usually offers, for example having windows\non all sides. The crowded plots of land and the small\ngaps between the houses prevent windows from being\nplaced on the walls facing the neighbour’s plot, which\nforces the optimization of interior layout, similar as in\nthe ordinary city apartments. Roads with the minimum\nrequired width and the lack of parking lots mean that\nalso here the sidewalks are densely packed with cars.\nPeople who are stuck in the morning and afternoon\ntraffic jams experience first hand the neglect of the issue\nof transport infrastructure, and its results.\n\nThe estates of single-family houses on the outskirts\nof cities consist of individual projects, usually erected\non the basis of a ready-made design purchased from a\ncatalogue, or they are developer-built, typically accord-\ning to a unified pattern. The interior design is no longer\nthe result of central planning, but it is still an industrial\nproduct; its choice often depends on the decision of the\ndesigner, and not the owner. In the “standard finish”\nonly the pattern of flooring has changed over the course\nof thirty years, while other elements remained uniform\nand fixed. The lack of public spaces, parks and play-\ngrounds is not conducive to the socialization of different\nage groups, but some time will pass until we see the\nconsequences of living confined between prefabricated\nfences. The privatization of all available land also results\nin reducing the public space to a minimum - the com-\nmunal space that the investor or the developer should\ntake care of, in theory.\n\nSlaves to prefabrication\nIn the years 1950-1982, 116,350 apartments in blocks of\nflats were designed, and they were built by 1995. Over\n300,000 inhabitants moved into these apartments. The\nStatistical Office of the Slovak Republic reports that in\nthe 1990s, about 380,000 people lived in Bratislava, of\nwhich about 80 per cent in prefabricated blocks. Cur-\nrently, Bratislava’s local government reports that there\nare 223,000 housing units in the city,!° which means\nthat 106,650 of those have been built in the last thirty\nyears. According to these sources, it was estimated that\nthe number of Bratislava residents was going to double\nsince the 1990s, but the official data of the statistical\noffice indicates 427,734 inhabitants in 2017. Meanwhile,\nresearchers from the Faculty of Natural Sciences of the\nComenius University in Bratislava counted that 630,000\nSIM cards are active in Bratislava at night.\"\n\nDuring the socialist period, thanks to state invest-\nments, 116,350 flats were built, plus 106,650 flats in the\n\n113 SLAVES TO PREFABRICATION\n\nprivate sector, without state funding. The municipality\nreports that 1 per cent of flats within its area belongs to\nthe city. These are 2,335 flats for rent, of which 878 are\nadministered directly by the municipal office, and the\nremaining ones are administered by district offices. The\naverage waiting time for such an apartment is seven to\neight years.”\n\nRecently, Bratislava changed its housing policy and\ndecided to build apartments for rent. Architectural and\nurban planning competitions have been announced for\nspecific locations, and there are also plans to renovate\ndecaying buildings and revitalize wastelands in order to\ncreate communal apartments. A contemporary alterna-\ntive to once affordable housing is a shared flat, rented\nfrom a private owner; another option is to purchase a\ncheaper property in the outskirts. The most popular\nhouses are those from the catalogue of ready-made\ndesigns, typically surrounded by a high concrete fence.\nAnd so we remain slaves to prefabrication. @\n\n“\n\nBratystawa, Petrzalka, Centrum\nhandlowe Aupark\n\nfot.

With one third of the capital’s inhab-\nitants living in this type of dwelling, the discussion on\nthe condition and future sustainability of these housing\nensembles is crucial and keeps coming up in the agenda\nof the currently governing party. However, centralised\nstrategies that manifest themselves in studies, consul-\ntations, conferences etc. are not sufficiently developed,\nand their practical implementation is lagging behind.\nThere is no doubt that disregarding the current condi-\ntion of large housing estates can result in further urban\nproblems in the longer term. Admittedly, over the last\n20 years, the estates have been subjected to uneven, but\nobservable improvement.\n\nKelenféld (1965-1983), Jozsef Attila (1958-1980) and\nUjpalota (1970-1979) housing estates represent develop-\nment patterns characteristic of the respective decades\nof their creation. Discussing the results of their renewal\ncan provide a comprehensive insight into the regenera-\ntion strategies of mass housing estates in Hungary.\n\nLarge — but only locally\nSeen in the European context, the housing estates\nof Budapest are middle-sized. The largest housing\nestate in Hungary (Békasmegyer) counts nearly 18,000\napartments. However, the size is relative - from urban\nperspective, a project can be identified as large-scale in\nreference to its local context.! In the Hungarian capital,\nthere are forty large-scale housing estates built after\n1954, when the mass housing construction was intensi-\nfied. Their population density is 182 people per hectare\nof land area, they possess more than 2,000 apartments?,\nand form an important part of the cityscape.\n\nThe Jozsef Attila-housing estate was built as one of\nthe first large-scale housing developments in the sixties\nin several stages, and it comprises 8,440 apartments.*\nKelenféld (9,297 apartments) was the first prefabricated\nhousing estate. With its 15,563 apartments, Ujpalota\nis one of the largest complexes in Budapest and its\nurban form reflects the impact of Toulouse-Le Mirail by\nGeorges Candilis, Alexis Josic, and Shadrach Woods.®\n\nJust because of their size, these housing com-\nplexes form substantial units of the urban fabric. Their\nmaintenance and prosperity can be ensured only on\nthe city level. The urban character of these areas can\nbe demonstrated from many different perspectives,\nsuch as urban morphology. While particular buildings\nand open spaces are changing slowly, their other urban\nfeatures (e.g. location-position, density, spatial organ-\nization, space usage and building types with different\nfunctions) are transforming in relation to their chang-\n\ning urban, social, and economic\nenvironment.\n\nIn order to discover and reveal contemporary urban\nfeatures of these housing estates, the author interviewed\nthree architects who were involved in the creation or\nreforms of the modernist large-scale built environ-\nment. Their comments are supporting the narrative.\nThe cardinal topics of the study address the problem\nof large housing estates in the context of their location,\ndensity, spatial organization, space usage and building\ntypes with different functions. These five features refer\nto the most important configurations of an urban form®\nin which other relevant subjects can be negotiated.\nConsequently, these are also the main urban planning\nand design issues in the regeneration of large housing\nestates that also have great impact on the social and\neconomic prosperity of their dwellers.\n\nUnequal development trajectories\nFor the past 25 years, the practice of building renovation\nhas been widespread in Eastern and Central Europe,\noften receiving support from the European Union. In\nHungary, more than a thousand blocks of flats received\nthermal insulation, new windows, and colourful\nfacades. During the 2007-2013 European Union budg-\netary period, several housing complexes were given\na chance to have their deteriorated public functions\nrestored, but in the period that followed, from 2014 to\n2020, only socially degraded housing estates could apply\nfor urban rehabilitation subsidies.” Nevertheless, in\nBudapest the municipality continued to support smaller\ninitiatives in the framework of TER_KOZ program that\nhas contributed to efficient modernization of post-war\nhousing areas.’ Despite all efforts, only few housing\nestates have changed significantly.\n\nKelenfold, J6zsef Attila and Ujpalota estates are\nexceptional, in the sense that they all benefited from\nstrong and well-established renewal concepts that were\nformulated over the years by integrating small- and\nlarge-scale projects focusing not only on the housing\nitself but also on urban relations. All three were con-\nceived as the so-called accelerator projects. The newest\nsubway line, ‘metro 4’, whose construction started in\n2006, connected Keleti railway station on the left bank\nof Danube (former Pest) with Kelenféld Railway Sta-\ntion on the right bank (Buda). The new transit artery\nstimulated the revival of the Kelenféld quarter, includ-\ning the large housing estate with same name. The first\nproject in Kelenféld housing estate was the relocation\nof a higher education institution, the SZAMALK Centre.\nSeveral plots had to be merged to create a large site for\nbuilding the newest shopping mall of the capital, Etele\nPlaza, in front of the railway station. As a result, the old\nSZAMALK Centre had to be demolished and in 2006 it\nmoved to a new building on the south part of the com-\nplex.

According to the urban development\nplans (UDP), the evolving hub was designated as a new\nintermodal node of Budapest. This gave boost for the\n\narea’s development, as was apparent from 2010 onwards.\nToday the postwar housing estate of Kelenféld enjoys\nmany benefits of the urban-scale development, but it\nalso witnesses disquieting actions happening - as we\nshall discuss.\n\nIn Ujpalota, the ‘Boldog Salkahazi Sara’ church —a\nflagship project of the new housing estate rehabilita-\ntion strategy of district XV, launched in 2008 - divided\nthe complex into four neighbourhoods with distinct\nidentities.° Later, the social rehabilitation program\nfor the specific area, named after one of the boundary\nstreets, Zsokavar, strengthened the concept of thematic\nneighbourhoods in the northeast part.

Since then, there have been a series\nof obstacles to the implementation of the winner appli-\ncation, but the council of the city part is standing by the\nlong-term plans.\n\nIn case of the three housing estates, the goals of envi-\nronmental transformation vary significantly, therefore\ntheir interventions are validated in different spatial and\nterritorial scales. The Kelenféld housing estate is going\nto be energized by the development of the wider part of\nthe city. The development of the Jozsef Attila housing\nestate emphasizes the spatial and social cohesion of the\narea. The social rehabilitation of the Ujpalota is linked to\nthe spatial distribution concept.\n\n116 REGINA BALLA\n\nThe city grows around\n\nToday, in contrast to the past, the city is growing around\n\nthe large post-war housing estates.\n\nIna short time, the first construction projects of the\nnew Kelenféld Center will be finalised: the Budapest\nONE office complex, the Etele smart shopping mall, as\n\nwell as the Trendo11, a multi-family building next to the\n\nwestern corner of the housing estate. Private investors\nimplemented these projects in exchange for the govern-\nment granting them an exemption from urban regula-\ntions and construction permit procedures of district XI\nand the city Budapest. In this way these projects have\nan own, maximized land use strategy. In the context of\n\n \n\n   \n\ni us —_——\n\nthe whole city, the demand for the new projects in the\narea is understandable, but its impact for the Kelenféld\nhousing estate is critical. The housing estate has its own\ncentral facility, around 500 meters from the assigned\nnew centre area. The former centre used to combine\nmany functions including a cinema, a library, a market,\nmany shops and offices, and it served as a broad ‘catch-\nment area’: it created a thriving urban space with lively\nactivities in the middle of the housing estate.” Over the\nlast 30 years, the former centre has deteriorated. The\narea needed revamping, but the solution that the urban\ndevelopers provided is somewhat dubious. Not only the\nlocation of the new centre, but also the closed architec-\ntural form of the Etele shopping mall may have a nega-\ntive impact on the physical environment and the social\nlife of the large housing estate.

The Pdlus\nCenter opened as a third-generation shopping mall in\n1996 at the northern end of the Ujpalota-Paskomliget\nhousing estate. According to a 2004 survey, 35 per cent\nof the customers came to the shopping centre on foot.'*\nWe can therefore conclude that at least as many of the\nresidents of the estate used the mall on a daily basis.\nWhen the new shopping mall, with a wide range of ser-\nvices, became accessible within a walking distance, the\ncentral commercial zone of the housing estate began to\ndeteriorate. In less than ten years, the former centre of\nthe area became a hot pit for criminal activities. There-\nfore, from 2010 onwards, eliminating crime and violence\nbecame one of the main goals in the Ujpalota estate. The\nproblems were addressed by reviving the area’s central\nfunctions in the framework of the EU-subsidised social\nrehabilitation program.

The buildings of the Jozsef Attila housing\nestate still reflect the small, cramped apartments of the\n1950s. Kelenféld estate exemplifies the limitations of\nthe first prefabricated panel construction starting in the\n1960s. Ujpalota estate was built in the 1970s after nation-\nwide improvement of the prefab building system, so the\napartment sizes and qualities are more convenient also\nfor families.\n\nIn the 2000s, the number of the inhabitants has\ndecreased by 50 per cent in the Jozsef Attila, 43 per cent\nin the Kelenfold, and 23 per cent in the Ujpalota estate.5\nAccording to a municipal survey, one third of the pop-\nulation of the Ujpalota are single, typically elderly; one\nthird live in a family, but single-parent families are sig-\nnificantly represented because of the affordable housing\nin the housing estate. The reaction of the district XV\nauthorities to this trend was exemplary: development\n\nTHE FUTURE OF MODERN URBAN FORMS\n\nof the social care system. Just to mention one exam-\n\nple, in 2014 the former office of a political party was\ntransformed into a youth centre (KIKOTO, in English\n“harbour”) where children can spend their afternoons\nattending out-of-school activities such as art workshops,\nor just meeting and learning together.!®\n\nThe primary focus of the new master development\nplan of Jozsef Attila housing estate is turning back\nthe population decline.” By building different types\nof infrastructure, families with more children would\nbe encouraged to move in. This should have a positive\nimpact on the economic sustainability, but also vital-\nize the community life of the typically ageing housing\nestate. Tamas Laszlo, architect, parliamentarian, former\nmayor of Ujpalota, has a holistic notion of the intensifi-\ncation of large-scale postwar areas: “Today we need to\nlook at the extensive city form of Budapest, examine the\ntransport network and suburbanization. Based on those\nexperiences we are facing significant deterioration in\nthe energy balance. From this point of view, it is inter-\nesting to appreciate the regeneration of housing estates,\neven by intensification. Expanding the range of apart-\nment types, resettling of young people would be more\nprofitable in the housing estates than sending families\nto the agglomeration where there is no infrastructure,\nno public institutions, where transport problems break\nthe families’ daily life.”\n\nOf the three cases, in Kelenféld the problem of small\napartment sizes is felt the least. Population decline is\nconnected with trending social demographics. Inhabit-\nants aged 20-24 and 25-39 are over-represented; those\nare mostly single university students or young couples\nusing the area as a stepping-stone.'* Despite the popula-\ntion decline, the area remains within the economically\nsustainable density range (approximately 100-150\npeople per hectare). A much more significant question is\nhow the economically favourable density could become\nperceptible in open space usage. For this purpose, there\nare many investments in the development of public\nsquares, community gardens, playgrounds, and large\nscaled recreational zones in each area. Integration of\nnew functions in Ujpalota contributed significantly to\na better perception of density conditions. The Boldog\nSalkahazi Sara church with its multifunctional spaces\nand the KIKOTO youth centre with a semi-private\ngarden appointed new destinations in the unused open\nspace that can establish a “critical mass” of passers-by\nwith the promise of public safety in housing estates.\n\nAltering spatial orientation\nMapping spatial organization principles is a consider-\nable step forward in the regeneration of the housing\nestates. Spatial connections need to be strengthened\nand, in other cases, rethought or redesigned. We need to\ntake a closer look at the main axes and neighbourhoods",

The area can be divided into quar-\nters by the axes of Nyirpalota, Paskomliget, and Zsdka-\nvar streets. In the renewal concept, the four subdivisions\nreceived new identities. According to Tamas Laszlo,\ntheir new character was built around the community,\nreligion, commerce, and social care, through the loca-\ntion of the abovementioned new functions. The vision is\nstill under implementation, and Ujpalota is also seeking\nfor other new ideas. Urban form of Ujpalota is the most\nnotable example for the impact of Team X in Hungary.\nThe main axes with a brutalist water tower-house in\nthe centre would also merit their own renewal strategy.\nThe main axes are problematic, whereas their reshaping\nwould require high financial outputs, modification of\nland use system, and concentration of social attractions,\nas can be concluded from the international practices.\n\nKelenféld strives for improvement of the main road\narteries leading to the new intermodal hub that resulted\nin the renewal of the main streets of the housing\nestates. In 2008, the Futureal Group, responsible for the\noperational planning of the centre of this part of the\ncity, proposed the construction of 4 to 6 tower blocks,\nincluding a 150-storey building alongside the Kelen-\nféld railway station and the Ormezé housing estate.”\n\n118 REGINA BALLA\n\nView from revitalised Bikas >\n\nPark, Kelenféld Estate\n\nPhoto: Regina Balla\n\n \n\nEventually, the vertical mass was rejected and replaced\nby more compact forms. The construction of the new\ncentre also changes the orientation of the housing\nestate. Previously, the Tétényi road leading to the city\ncentre was the dominant roadway of the area. Today\nEtele road becomes increasingly prominent as a primary\navenue with line 1 tram, refurbished public spaces,\nand new developments. The new cross section of Etele\nroad represents all architectural and landscape design\nvalues that have been wished for on the main streets of\nUjpalota housing estate for last fifty years.2° However,\nthe two housing estates cannot be treated in the same\nway. The renewal of the axes of Ujpalota can only be\nimagined in a specific project for this particular hous-\ning estate. The location has no potential for that kind\nof real estate development, which currently generates 19\nresources and spatial orientations in Kelenféld.\nMeanwhile, in the Jozsef Attila housing estate the\nscale of the streets is smaller. They were designed in line\nwith the 1950s planning approach, with only negligible\ncar traffic in mind. Inhabitants urge the local author-\nities to minimize the traffic in order to preserve green\nareas, quoting garden-city designs and children-friendly\nsurroundings. The noise pollution that results from the\ntraffic at Péttyds and Dési Huber streets is so critical\nthat it exceeds the noise limit allowed by law. Thus it\nsignificantly affects the quality of life of the inhabitants.\n\n20\n\n21\n\nResidential blocks, Jozsef\nAttila Estate\n\nPhoto: Regina Balla\n\nv\nGrassroots gardens created by\nlocal residents, Ujpalota Estate\n\nPhoto: Regina Balla\n\n \n\nToronyhaz Mellett Kampanyol a Futureal,\nPortfolio, 2008, https://www.portfolio.hu/in-\ngatlan/20080611/toronyhaz-mellett-kampany-\nol-a-futureal-98067 (accessed: 20.08.2020).\nG.

    "Page_121": "The municipality is currently planning to narrow the\ncross-section of Péttyés Street, giving back the streets\nto pedestrians and cyclists, and creating a new linear\ncommon space within the housing estate.\n\nTerritorial inertia\nThe most complicated issues in the renewal of large\nhousing estates concern regulatory plans and owner-\nship relations. In Hungary, there is no coherent legal\nframework for solving all of these current issues but\ndevelopers of the three housing estates have addressed\nthe problem. In Hungary, the cohesive land of housing\nestates remains state-owned, but the buildings them-\nselves have been privatized - this means that in the\nstate-owned area, condominiums with tens to hundreds\nof owners are “floating” like islands on their building\nsized plots. They are referred to as “floating plots”\n(Hungarian tiszotelek - land under the building plus one\nmetre on each side for the scaffolding).\n\nIn recent years, an attempt has been made to uti-\nlize the open space in the Ujpalota housing estate by\nexpanding their building sizes using the “floating plots”.\nIn the last 25 years, some residents have put up fences\nin the public open space around the typically four-sto-\nrey, residential buildings, creating privately or semi-\nprivately used gardens. They did not ask permission\nfrom the municipality or from other residents to install\nthe fences but in the end, they inspired the maintainers\nof the district.2 The municipality initiated similar activ-\nities, however, institutionalized “self-gardening” was\n\nless successful, as evidenced by the\n\nquality of maintenance.\n\nIn the Jozsef Attila housing estate, one of the main\ngoals of the renovation is the transformation of the\nresidential buildings that also requires serious reor-\nganization of the land ownership structure. There\nare many patties to this operation, and the executive\nplanners’ task is also unclear, Janos Gyergyak explains:\n“It was very difficult to deal with the fact that there is a\ncondominium but the client is not the condominium.\nOn the other hand, we found it very positive that the\nmunicipality is thinking about how to revitalize private\ncondominiums.” How can we, architects accredited by\nlocal municipalities, design extensions for a block of\nflats with private owned apartments if the owners do\nnot have the financial capacity for its implementation,\nnor is it certain that each inhabitant is interested in\nthe conversion (i.e. expectations can vary from storey\nto storey)? Tamas Laszlo considers legislation almost\nincapable of dealing with such complex problems: “My\nbasic proposition is that there is no easy solution toa\ncomplex problem. Some programs require complex solu-\ntions.” But who will make the effort to elaborate the legal\nsolution, if the legislators in Hungary recently restricted\nthe restructuring of postwar areas even more — for exam-\nple by constraining transfer of ownership right to the\nstate-owned or municipal land? On the one hand, this is\na safeguard against distorted real estate developments,\nbut on the other, it also creates territorial inertia in the\nrenewal of block of flats.\n\nArchitectural potential\nIn the housing estates, the biggest potential rests in the\nstate- and municipality-owned public and commercial\nbuildings. Their renewal helps improve the quality of\ninhabitants’ life and refresh building stock with contem-\nporary designs. Experiences are diverse. In most of the\npost-war housing estates, these buildings went through\nbasic renovation. In Ujpalota, renewals of the “Spiral\nHouse” service complex and the Health Care Centre are\nthe most prominent building developments in the range\nof housing estates in Hungary. In these two cases, high\narchitectural quality was also relevant for long-term\n\n \n\nTHE FUTURE OF MODERN URBAN FORMS\n\nsustainability. Above the main reason they stand out is\ndue to the fact that they truly serve the needs of the local\ninhabitants through the renewed functions, unlike those\nin Kelenféld. The renewal and replacement of buildings\nin the housing estate is a kind of side effect that is some-\ntimes positive, and in other case problematic - like the\nabove-mentioned Etele Plaza.\n\nConclusion\nThere is much potential in contemporary large hous-\ning estates that still haven’t reached the limits of their\nuseful existence. But their urban development requires\nserious attention to avoid destructive urban formation\nprocesses and to rethink some planning issues from\nthe last 25 years’ practice. The aim of this paper was to\nhighlight some of the ongoing initiatives in relation to\nthree large housing estates in Budapest that can provide\nsome insight into the Hungarian best practices of urban\nrenewal, where besides mere renovation of buildings,\nurban relations came to the fore: in terms of location-\nposition, density, spatial organization, space usage and\nfunction replacement of public buildings. Observing\nthe planned and already implemented interventions\nin the three housing estates, we can conclude that, with\nvarying success, these initiatives contribute to a better\nembedding of the modernist urban forms to the metro-\npolitan fabric of Budapest. e\n\n€\nHealth Care Centre, Ujpalota\nEstate\n\nPhoto: Regina Balla",
