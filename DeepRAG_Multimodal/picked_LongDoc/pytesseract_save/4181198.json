As required by Ordinance 15949, to measure the effectiveness of the\nprograms funded by MIDD, the King County Department of Community and Human Services (DCHS)\nconducts evaluations that describe how MIDD funding is spent and report ona set of required output\nand outcome measures for each MIDD strategy.\n\nThis report, as required by King County Metropolitan Council Ordinance 17998, presents the results of a\ncomprehensive assessment of the MIDD evaluations conducted from 2008-2015. The assessment was\nconducted by the King County Office of Performance, Strategy and Budget (PSB). The report identifies\nstrengths and weaknesses of the MIDD evaluations and offers recommendations for future evaluations\nof MIDD.\n\nThe assessment is based on the results of 30 stakeholder interviews, a review and comparison of\nevaluation documents, a review of current practices in behavioral health evaluations, and evaluation\nbest practices.\n\nOverview\n\nMIDD adoption and implementation\nWhat is evaluation?\n\nOrdinance 15949, adopted by the Council in 2007,\nauthorized the collection of the MIDD sales tax,\nestablished five policy goals to guide the development of\nMIDD implementation and called for the development of\nthree separate plans:\n\nEvaluation has been standard practice in\nhealth and human services for many years.\nEvaluation is a mechanism for learning\nwhat is and is not working, for providing\ninformation to be used in quality\nimprovement efforts, and for\ndemonstrating value of spending.

    "Page_4": "MIDD Evaluation Assessment\nFinal Report\n\nHow MIDD works today\n\nThe 2008 MIDD Implementation Plan is organized around five service areas subdivided into 37 different\nstrategies. Each strategy is implemented through one or more programs that provide services for clients.\nServices are delivered either through County-based programs or through community-based programs\ncontracted by the County.\n\nThe MIDD Evaluation Plan outlines the intent to monitor and evaluate the MIDD strategies. It consists of\nthree evaluation components:\n\n1. System Process Evaluation to describe how the implementation of MIDD is progressing.\n\n2. Strategy Process Evaluation to assess what was done based on the performance goals specified in\nthe Evaluation Plan’s evaluation matrix (Appendix D).\n\n3. Outcome Evaluation to assess the effect of MIDD strategies on MIDD policy goals (Appendix C) and\nother expected results.\n\nThe results of the MIDD evaluation work are published twice a year ina MIDD Annual Report that\nsummarizes the findings of the most recent October-September time period and a mid-year Progress\nReport that summarizes the findings of the most recent October-March time period. The reporting\nperiods for MIDD were established in 2008 in Ordinance 16262.\n\nMIDD Evaluation Assessment Findings and Recommendations\n\nThis section summarizes the key findings and recommendations of this report. These findings and\nrecommendations are based on opinions and expertise of interviewees, document reviews, best\npractices research, and staff conducting this assessment. The table on the following page contains a\nsummary of the key strengths identified in this assessment as well as identified challenges and\nassociated recommendations to address these challenges. More context, explanation, and examples of\nhow these strengths and challenges were identified and the details of each recommendation are\nincluded in the body of the report\n\nNote: Key evaluation terms in the summary table below are defined in the glossary on page 9.\n\nWhen reading this report, it is important to keep in mind that the assessment compares MIDD\nevaluations conducted between 2008 and 2015 to (1) the MIDD Evaluation Plan adopted by the King\nCounty Council in 2008; (2) current expectations of stakeholders, which may not have been the same in\n2008; and (3) to current practices in behavioral health care evaluation, which is a continually evolving\nfield. Therefore, in some cases the findings reflect gaps between the original evaluation plan and its\nimplementation, but other times they reflect how expectations and practices have changed over time.\nAll findings are important learnings that roll into actionable recommendations that can inform the\ndesign of the evaluation of a potential MIDD renewal.\n\n \n\nApril 2016 Final Report 2",

In King County, this tax is known as the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) sales tax.\nIn 2015, MIDD sales tax revenues totaled nearly $60 million and served more than 23,000 individuals.\n\nMIDD-funded programs are intended “to prevent and reduce chronic homelessness and unnecessary\ninvolvement in the criminal justice and emergency medical systems and promote recovery for persons\nwith disabling mental illness and chemical dependency by implementing a full continuum of treatment,\nhousing and case management services.”\"\n\nOrdinance 15949 defines five policy goals (see Appendix C) and requires that the King County\nDepartment of Community and Human Services (DCHS) conduct evaluations that describe how MIDD\nfunding is spent and report on a set of required output” and outcome’ measures. To fulfill these\nrequirements, the System Performance Evaluation Group in the King County Department of Community\nand Human Services, Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division’ conducts\nevaluations according to the MIDD Evaluation Plan. The MIDD Evaluation Plan was adopted by the\nMetropolitan King County Council (the Council) via Ordinance 16262 in 2008.\n\nThe intent of the MIDD evaluation efforts was to “examine the impact of all strategies to demonstrate\neffectiveness of MIDD funds and to assess whether the MIDD goals are being achieved, on both\nindividual and system levels’’and to provide transparency to decision makers, stakeholders and the\npublic on how MIDD dollars were being spent.\n\nPurpose of this MIDD Evaluation Assessment\n\nThe 2007 MIDD sales tax legislation includes a sunset date of December 31, 2016, ending the authority\nof King County to collect the tax. King County and community partners are in the process of identifying\nfuture MIDD activities, if the tax is renewed by the Council.\n\nIn planning for the potential renewal of MIDD, the Council adopted Ordinance 17998 in March 2015\nrequiring a comprehensive review and assessment of the MIDD sales tax that was collected from 2008-\n2016, including “... proposed recommendations on improvements to MIDD performance measures,\nevaluation data gathering, including a review of the evaluation processes, timeframes, and data\ngathering.”\n\nThis report is an assessment of the MIDD evaluations conducted from 2008 to 2015.

The\nresults of this work comprise the body of this report.\n\nThe methodology used for the assessment, which was conducted from November 2015 through\nFebruary 2016, included three approaches:\n\ne Review of Evaluation Documents. PSB staff gathered and reviewed historical MIDD evaluation\ninformation, including the MIDD Evaluation Plan and the 2008 — 2015 MIDD progress and annual\nreports. PSB staff compared the Evaluation Plan with the MIDD progress and annual reports to\ndetermine to what extent the Plan was implemented. PSB staff also assessed the evaluation\nmethodology, drawing on evaluation literature, key informant interviews, and expertise in\nevaluation methodology and performance measurement.\n\ne Current Practice Review. PSB staff reviewed practices used by counties similar in size to King County\nfor the evaluation of behavioral health care programs and reviewed innovative approaches to the\nevaluation of behavioral health care.\n\ne Stakeholder Interviews. PSB staff interviewed 30 people, including MIDD Oversight Committee\nmembers and designees, MIDD service providers, staff from the King County Executive Office, King\nCounty Council, King County Department of Community and Human Services, King County\nInformation Technology and external subject matter experts. The list of interviewees is provided in\nAppendix A, and the list of interview questions is provided in Appendix B. Due to the qualitative\nnature of the interviews and the purposive selection of stakeholders interviewed, this document\ndoes not quantify interview results. For instance, reporting the percent of interviewees who\nmentioned a particular topic during the conversation would convey specificity that is not warranted\nbased on the methodology used.\n\nBACKGROUND FOR MIDD EVALUATION ASSESSMENT\n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide background and context for the themes and recommendations\n\nof this MIDD evaluation assessment. The section addresses the purpose and key concepts used in health\nand human service evaluations. It also provides a summary of current practices in behavioral health care\nevaluations, after briefly describing MIDD implementation and programming.\n\nMIDD Implementation Structure\n\nIn 2007, the Council voted to enact a MIDD sales tax to support new or expanded mental illness and\nchemical dependency and therapeutic court programs and services.

The changed or improved conditions are the intended outcomes or products of the\nprograms. A program’s intended outcomes are identified in the program evaluation framework. The\nframework articulates the “outcomes of social programs as part of a logic model that connects the\nprogram’s activities to proximal (immediate) outcomes that, in turn, are expected to lead to other, more\ndistal outcomes. If correctly described, this series of linked relationships among outcomes represents the\nprogram’s assumptions about the critical steps between program services and the ultimate social\nbenefits the program is intended to produce.””” Program evaluation terms used throughout this report\nare defined in the Evaluation Term Glossary below.\n\n \n\nEvaluation Term Glossary\n\nCausal Relationship: A causal relationship between two events exists if the occurrence of the first causes the\nother.\n\nProximal Outcome: An outcome a program can impact directly, for example, the severity of mental health\nsymptoms among participants of programs that provide mental health services.\n\nDistal Outcome: An outcome that is distant from program activities but the ultimate outcome of interest, such as\nthe MIDD policy goals articulated in Ordinance 15949. Because distal outcomes are more removed from program\nactivities than proximal outcomes, the former tend to be impacted by many factors outside of a program’s control.\nA program, therefore, has less direct influence on distal than proximal outcomes.\n\nEffectiveness: Effectiveness addresses how well a program achieves its stated goals and objectives.\nMeasure: A measure is a value, characteristic, or metric used to track the performance of a program.\n\nOutcome Measure: A measure that describes the state of the population or social condition a program is expected\nto have changed.\n\nOutput Measure: A measure of the product or service produced through a program.\n\nTarget: A desired number or level for an output or outcome measure. Targets are the objectives an organization is\nstriving to reach.\n\nThe definitions are based on:\n\nKinney AS, Mucha MU, eds. (2010). State and Local Government Performance Management: Sourcebook.

Because “a given set of outcomes can be produced by factors other than program\nprocesses”’®, for health and human services evaluations interested in demonstrating impact, it is\ntherefore particularly important to be grounded in a detailed evaluation framework that links program\nactivities to proximal and distal outcomes.\n\nCurrent Practice Review of Behavioral Health Care Evaluations\n\nThe purpose of this section is to describe current practices being used to evaluate behavioral health\ncare.\n\nBehavioral health care quality measurement is an evolving practice\n\nTo support access to safe, effective and affordable behavioral health care for all Americans, the U.S.\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n(SAMHSA) started to develop the National Behavioral Health Quality Framework (NBHQF) in 2011, that\nis, after the 2008 adoption of the MIDD Evaluation Plan.” The NBHQF framework is intended to guide\nthe “identification and implementation of key behavioral health care quality measures for use in agency\nor system funding decisions, monitoring behavioral health of the nation, and the delivery of behavioral\nhealth care.”\n\n8 Hatry HP, Wholey JS (2006).

In addition, SAMHSA encouraged utilizing these measures, as\nappropriate, to have a consistent set of indicators of quality in behavioral health prevention, promotion,\ntreatment, and recovery support efforts across the U.S.\n\nNational call for measurement-based care in the delivery of behavioral health services\n\nTo advance the quality of behavioral health care in the United States, the Kennedy Forum” recently\nendorsed the use of measurement-based care. “All primary care and behavioral health providers\ntreating mental health and substance use disorders should implement a system of measurement-based\ncare whereby validated symptom rating scales are completed by patients and reviewed by clinicians\nduring encounters. Measurement-based care will help providers determine whether the treatment is\nworking and facilitate treatment adjustments, consultations, or referrals for higher intensity services\nwhen patients are not improving as expected.”\n\nThe Washington State Mental Health Integration Program (MHIP)”” is one example of a measurement-\nbased mental health care approach that has been implemented locally. The program, which started in\nJanuary 2008, now includes almost 200 community health and mental health centers across\nWashington, with funding from Washington State, King County and Community Health Plan of\nWashington. MHIP uses a patient registry to track and measure patient goals and clinical outcomes. The\napproach combines the provision of mental health care with concurrent evaluation of patient response\nto inform providers, who may adjust care if a patient is not improving as expected. In addition, provider\npayment is tied to quality of care indicators.\n\nAs indicated, such an approach is not commonly applied. This is due in part to the fact that\nmeasurement-based behavioral health care is not common practice in the U.S., despite having been\nproposed as long as twenty years ago.”’ Organizations with integrated physical and behavioral health\ncare may be more open to a measurement-based focus than community mental health and chemical\ndependency providers for whom measurement-based care has not been widely applied.

The adopted plan outlines the evaluation and reporting plan for the\nstrategies funded with the MIDD sales tax, including a proposed schedule for evaluations; output and\noutcome measures and measure targets (the “evaluation matrix”); and data elements to be used for\nreporting and evaluations. The Plan consists of three components:\n\n1. System Process Evaluation to describe how the implementation of MIDD is progressing.\n2. Strategy Process Evaluation to assess what was done.\n\n3. Outcome Evaluation to assess the effect of MIDD strategies on MIDD policy goals and other expected\nresults.\n\nThe results of the evaluation work are published twice a year in an Annual Report that summarizes the\nfindings of the most recent October-September time period and a mid-year Progress Report that\nsummarizes the findings of the most recent October-March time period. The reporting periods for MIDD\nwere established in 2008 in Ordinance 16262.”\n\nThis section describes strengths and challenges of the MIDD Evaluation Plan as implemented. These\nfindings and recommendations are based on the opinions of the interviewees, document reviews, and\nbest practices review conducted for this assessment. The chapter is organized into five topical parts.\nEach part presents analytic findings, followed by recommendations to address identified challenges.\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan and Evaluation Framework\n\nThe 2008 MIDD Evaluation Plan describes an approach to evaluate (1) strategy implementation and (2)\nstrategy impact. For these two domains of evaluation, the Plan is comprehensive, oriented toward\nlearning and improvement and focused on accountability to achieve desired outputs and outcomes.\nMultiple strengths of the Plan were evident during this assessment:\n\ne The Plan provides flexibility to adjust measures as learning takes place over time, especially with\nrespect to output measures and their targets. As strategies are implemented and better understood,\nevaluation may require new or updated measures and targets.*° For instance, if a strategy can serve\nmore clients than originally anticipated, the target for its output measure may be increased. In\ncontrast, if a data source does not materialize as anticipated, data may not be available to collect\nand analyze planned output and outcome measures.\n\n28 Hennepin County, http://www.hennepin.us/your-government/research-data/shape-surveys\n\n*° For additional information on the history and structure of the MIDD and its Evaluation Plan, please see Appendix\nC: Additional Information on MIDD and its Evaluation Plan.\n\n30 Kinney AS, Mucha MJ, eds.

    "Page_16": "MIDD Evaluation Assessment\nFinal Report\n\nThe MIDD Evaluation Plan includes a process to make amendments, which benefits the evaluation\nby keeping it relevant to decision makers and stakeholders over time.\n\nThe Plan accommodates the diversity of strategies supported by MIDD funding. MIDD funds\ndozens of strategies, ranging from increasing the number of trainings and licensed behavioral health\ncare providers, to improving school-based suicide prevention, to providing direct services to people\nin crisis.\n\nThe MIDD Evaluation Plan accommodates this variety by identifying strategy-specific output and\noutcome measures, which sets up an evaluation that can provide meaningful, relevant measures for\neach strategy.\n\nThis assessment also identified challenges associated with how the Evaluation Plan was implemented\nand communicated. Challenges include:\n\nThe MIDD logic model lacks detail in describing how MIDD strategies are expected to bring about\nchanges to reach MIDD policy goals. Evaluation best practice recommends that logic models\ndescribe in detail how MIDD strategies are expected to influence both proximal and distal outcomes\nbased on evidence.” Interviewees and a review of evaluation reports found that while the current\nMIDD evaluation framework has logic chains between measures for some strategies, it does not\nhave enough proximal outcomes and clear logical linkages to the distal outcomes (or policy goals) to\nsupport audience understanding of how MIDD strategies are influencing MIDD policy goals.” In\naddition, interviewees noted that, in their opinion, it is not possible for MIDD-funded providers to\ninfluence the MIDD policy goals directly.\n\nInterviewees have different expectations for the MIDD evaluation than what the MIDD Evaluation\nPlan articulates. The Evaluation Plan fulfills the requirements of legislation as described in\nOrdinances 15949 and 16262. However, interviewees have different opinions on the usefulness of\nthe MIDD evaluation, as executed, because it does not meet all of their expected purposes.\nExpectations for how the evaluation could be used include: monitoring program implementation,\nsupporting continuous improvement, informing MIDD funding decisions, and demonstrating impact\nat the participant, provider, program, strategy, or community level. Interviewees also identified\nmultiple potential audiences for the evaluation, such as: the community, MIDD providers, King\nCounty staff managing MIDD funding, King County Council, and the King County Executive Office.\n\nWhen evaluation intent and stakeholder expectations do not match, the usefulness of an evaluation\nis limited because some users of the results will not be able to meet their desired purpose.\n\nInterviewees do not agree on the outputs and outcomes they would like to see included in MIDD\nevaluations. This assessment included interviews with MIDD Oversight Committee\nmembers/designees, MIDD service providers, King County Executive Office staff, Department of\nCommunity and Human Services staff and behavioral health and program evaluation subject matter\nexperts. Among interviewees, there was no consistent response about which of the current\nmeasures are useful and what new measures would be desirable. Similar to the finding above, this\n\n31 Rossi PH, Freeman HE, Lipsey MW (2004). Evaluation: A Systematic Approach, 7\" Edition.

This observation is not a challenge of the current MIDD evaluation, but\nprovides information for future evaluation design discussions. It highlights a disconnect between\nwhat the current evaluation was designed to do and how stakeholders desire to use the evaluation\nresults.\n\nInterviewees expressed that they would like to better understand how much need there is in the\ncommunity for each type of service, how different MIDD strategies contribute to meeting that need,\nand the unmet need that remains. If decision makers want to address these questions in the design\nof the new MIDD evaluation, conducting a needs assessment is a common practice in health and\nhuman service program design.*® A “needs assessment” is an analysis to determine the number of\nindividuals who would benefit from services and ways in which their needs can be met. A needs\nassessment grounds a program in an understanding of the current state; provides baseline data for\nquantifying the impact of a program on meeting community needs; and, when used in evaluation,\nprovides context for output and outcome measures and demonstrates the potential of the program\nin relation to the community as a whole.\n\nThere are multiple challenges inherent in conducting a needs assessment that should be considered\nas well, including the cost of conducting an assessment, availability of information to support a\nrigorous assessment, developing agreed-upon definitions of “need” and “unmet need” across\nmultiple areas, and an agreed upon framework for how to use assessment results in decision\nmaking.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo address the challenges related to the Evaluation Plan and framework identified above, the MIDD II\nevaluation design should:\n\nR1.\n\nClarify the purpose of the evaluation and logic of the evaluation framework.\n\nThe evaluation plan for MIDD II, and its accompanying evaluation framework, should have a clearly\ndefined and stated purpose. This purpose should describe what the evaluation is intended to\ninform, who will be informed by the results, and how the results can and should be used by the\nintended audience. It should also clarify any caveats or limitations about conclusions that should\nnot be drawn from the evaluation, based on its design.\n\nThe evaluation framework should describe how MIDD-funded activities are expected to influence\nMIDD participant outcomes and how participant outcomes link to system- and community-based\noutcomes and policy goals. The framework should include a logic model that identifies proximal\noutcomes for each strategy™ and describes how impacting these outcomes affects distal\noutcomes. In addition, factors that influence policy goals aside from MIDD-funded activities should\n\n33 Watkins R, West Meiers M, Visser Y (2012).

Once these logical linkages are made, a strategy can be evaluated on its ability to\ngenerate the proximal and distal outcomes.\n\nInvolve stakeholders in developing the evaluation framework.\n\nAny future evaluation framework would benefit from more involvement of community\nstakeholders, King County MIDD staff, program providers, and the evaluation team in developing\nits purpose, the logic chain that connects MIDD strategies to policy goals, and identifying measures\nfor outputs and proximal and distal outcomes.”\n\nInvolving community stakeholders, King County MIDD staff and program providers in developing\nthe evaluation framework with the evaluation team will help build agreement regarding desired\nresults and values and beliefs about change processes and their underlying assumptions. Working\nin partnership may help address resistance to data collection and reporting by selecting measures\nthat are relevant to stakeholders and program providers and thus enhance the use of evaluation\nresults to further policy goals. Evaluation best practice suggests this approach to make the\nevaluation more relevant to those implementing programs and to help avoid future issues around\nconflicting expectations.\n\nMIDD Evaluation Output and Outcome Measures\n\nThe MIDD evaluation plan includes an evaluation matrix that lists, for each MIDD strategy, output and\noutcome measures. The goal of the output measurement was to assess what was done with MIDD\nmoney. The goal of the outcome measurement was to assess the effect of MIDD strategies on MIDD\npolicy goals and other expected results. MIDD document reviews and interviews identified the following\nchallenges related to the output and outcome measures selected for the MIDD evaluation:\n\nNo or too few proximal outcomes are measured for many MIDD strategies. As described on page\n9, evaluation best practice notes that both distal and proximal outcomes are important for\nunderstanding the impact of a MIDD strategy. The evaluation matrix in the Evaluation Plan lists\noutput and outcome measures by MIDD strategies. In this matrix and in subsequent updates to the\nmatrix published in MIDD progress and annual reports, MIDD strategies are linked with output\nmeasures, proximal outcome measures and measures of policy goals (the distal outcomes) for some\nstrategies. For the remaining strategies, however, either no or too few proximal outcomes are\nincluded to be able to assess whether MIDD strategies influence the MIDD policy goals or to support\nMIDD continuous improvement efforts.\n\nFor example, to gauge whether spending money for Strategy 1a-1 (Increase access to mental health\noutpatient services) reduces the number of jail bookings, the MIDD evaluation matrix links:\noO people who received services (measured output) to:\n= changes in symptom severity (measured proximal outcome), which is assumed to:\ne improve daily functioning (not measured) and reduce behaviors (not measured) that\nresult in:\noO ajail booking (measured distal outcome) or emergency room visit (measured distal\noutcome).\n\n35 Friedman M (2005).

    "Page_19": "MIDD Evaluation Assessment\nFinal Report\n\nIn this case, some links between MIDD strategies, output and proximal outcome measures and\npolicy goals are assumed instead of measured, which is not sufficient to be able to attribute\nattaining MIDD policy goals to Strategy 1a-1.\n\nIn addition, the evaluation does not measure proximal outcomes for strategies that use evidence-\nbased approaches, such as Strategy 1c: Emergency Room Substance Abuse and Early Intervention\nProgram. For such strategies, the evaluation instead measures the number of clients served (output)\nand jail and ER use (distal outcomes). The Evaluation Plan notes that for MIDD strategies based on\nevidence-based practices there is no need to demonstrate a causal relationship between MIDD\nfunding and MIDD policy goals. While this approach sounds efficient, it does not support continuous\nimprovement efforts, which interviewees noted as one desired purpose of the evaluation.\nContinuous improvement efforts require information on whether MIDD activities have the intended\nimmediate impact on program participants so that adjustments can be made, if necessary.\nMoreover, evidence-based practices can only be expected to support MIDD policy goals if the\npractices have been shown to impact the type of goals specified for MIDD. The MIDD evaluation\nplan and the MIDD progress and annual reports do not note which evidence-based practices\nsupported by MIDD have been proven to impact such policy goals as the ones adopted for MIDD.\n\ne Interviewees stated that, for providers of behavioral health treatment, measures should be\nclinically relevant, including measures of behavioral health symptoms, daily function and quality\nof life. Behavioral health symptoms are measured for some MIDD strategies in the current\nevaluation. However, interviewees perceived that, in an effort to avoid additional data collection\nburden, some measures were chosen because providers collected the data already, not because the\nmeasures are necessarily well-suited for behavioral health screening and treatment monitoring.\nTherefore, the selected measures may not be useful in determining the effectiveness of strategies\nfunded by MIDD.\n\nIn particular, the symptom and function measures that are used for the MIDD evaluation include the\nPHQ-9 (for depression), the GAD7 (for anxiety), the Problem Severity Summary (PSS), and the\nChildren’s Functional Assessment Rating Scale (CFARS). The first two measures (PHQ-9 and GAD-7)\nhave been thoroughly validated** and recommended by the Center for Integrated Health Solutions\n(CIHS) *” and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)**. However, there is limited\n(PSS) or no validation (CFARS) in the behavioral health research literature for the other two\nmeasures and neither is included in the list of measures kept by CIHS and AHRQ.

The PSS was selected\nafter a 2009 survey of King County mental health providers revealed that no outcome measure was\nemployed by a majority of survey respondents. About half of the respondents reported using the\nPSS, which had been utilized countywide in the past. The PSS was developed locally for an adult\ncommunity and mental health population, is available free of charge and relatively brief, which\nreduces data collection burden. When the decision was made to include the PSS in the MIDD\noutcome measures, it was noted that the measure does not have a strong recovery orientation and\nthat it is reported by clinicians, not the individuals who receive services.\n\nThe detail and specificity of output measures in the Evaluation Matrix vary by strategy. While\nmost output measures in the evaluation focus on ongoing service provision, some strategies include\noutput measures only for program start-up activities. For example, Strategy 1f includes a measure of\n“Employ a 1.0 FTE parent partner specialist.” In contrast, Strategy 16a includes the ongoing\nmeasures “Number of residential units created” and “Number of rental subsidies dispersed.”\nFurther, it is not clear why measure types and details vary across strategies, nor why some measures\nare categorized as output instead of outcome measures. Having consistency across strategies in\nselecting measures for start-up versus ongoing activities and in categorizing output versus outcome\nmeasures improves the clarity and purpose of the evaluation and enhances transparency and\naccountability.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo address the challenges related to output and outcome measures identified above, the MIDD II\nevaluation design should:\n\nR3.\n\nEstablish relevant output and outcome measures.\n\nTo have an evaluation that supports learning and continuous improvement, output and outcome\nmeasures must be relevant to participants and program providers and be useful to monitor\nimplementation and improvements.\n\nIn addition, future MIDD evaluations may benefit from measures that communicate and monitor\nprogram quality and benefits from the clients’ perspective. The Institute of Medicine Committee\non Crossing the Quality Chasm strongly recommends a focus on behavioral health care that is safe,\neffective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable.*° The current practice review shows\nthat measures of the quality of service — such as client complaints and client satisfaction — are used\nby other jurisdictions. For instance, the North Texas Behavioral Health Authority employs the\nfollowing client satisfaction measures as one way to monitor and improve the quality of its\nservices:\n\ne How satisfied are you with being treated with respect by staff at this clinic?\ne How satisfied are you about your ability to improve your own life?\ne Overall, how satisfied are you with the mental health services of your clinic?\n\n39 Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Crossing the Quality Chasm: Adaptation to Mental Health and Addictive\nDisorders.

    "Page_21": "MIDD Evaluation Assessment\nFinal Report\n\nThese and other questions may ensure that clients are receiving care that is respectful and meets\ntheir needs. In some cases, particularly where MIDD is only a portion of the total funding of a\nprogram that might be evaluated by other funders, these types of measures may already be\ntracked and the evaluation design should take care to not duplicate efforts.\n\nR4. When available, select valid, reliable, and sensitive proximal outcome measures in\ncollaboration with service providers.\n\nApplying best practices, the MIDD evaluation should select measures that have been\ndemonstrated to be reliable, sensitive, and valid.” In addition, providers should be involved when\nproximal outcome measures are selected for the services they provide. Providers are more likely to\nsupport evaluation efforts when they see value in the data they have to collect for the evaluation.\nFor example, validated symptom rating scales could be administered to MIDD participants during\nMIDD-funded contacts with behavioral health care providers.\n\n“Symptom rating scales (also known as patient-reported outcome measures) are brief structured\ninstruments that patients use to report their perceptions about the frequency and/or severity of the\npsychiatric symptoms they are experiencing (...) These symptom rating scales (e.g., PHQ-9 for\ndepression) are practical to administer, interpretable, reliable, and sensitive to changes in the\nfrequency/severity of psychiatric symptoms and functional impairment over time. (....) With clinical\njudgement alone, behavioral health providers frequently fail to detect a lack of improvement or a\nworsening of symptoms in their patients, and this can lead to clinical inertia (i.e., not changing the\ntreatment plan even though the patient is not benefiting from the current treatment).\n\nWithout the systematic monitoring of symptoms, providers miss opportunities to improve their\ntreatments over time and clinical practices miss opportunities to evaluate quality improvement\nactivities. In addition, when aggregated across all patients in a clinical practice or healthcare\nsystem, symptom rating scales data can be used to demonstrate the value of behavioral health\nservices to payers.” *\n\nCurrently, MIDD funds often pay only for a subset of individuals who receive services that are\nincluded in the MIDD strategies. It would be challenging to introduce new outcome measures only\nfor this subset of individuals. Thus, future MIDD evaluation designs need to weigh the cost to\nproviders and the County of introducing new outcome measures versus the benefit of having valid,\nreliable, and sensitive measures.\n\nR5. Focus on clinically and practically meaningful changes in outcomes.\n\nA statistically significant difference from zero does not necessarily imply that there was a\nmeaningful change in an outcome, or that patients noticed a difference in their daily lives.

For instance, the PHQ-9\ndistinguishes depression levels ranging from no to severe depression. Knowing that depression\nsymptoms changed from severe to mild after a person participated in MIDD would be more\nmeaningful than knowing that there was any change in their symptoms, because any change may\nnot be enough to make a difference in the person’s life. An example of this suggestion can be\nfound in the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Fifth Annual Report, which notes that “of the\n613 [people] with severe or extremely severe anxiety symptoms during their pre period, 161 (26%)\nshowed only slight or no impairment in at least one follow-up measure” (p. 60).\n\nMIDD Evaluation Process\n\nThe MIDD evaluation is conducted by the System Performance Evaluation (SPE) section within the\nBehavioral Health and Recovery Division of DCHS. The SPE team is responsible for reviewing output and\noutcome data collected and submitted to the county by MIDD-funded providers; cleaning and\nconsolidating the data; and conducting data analyses that are the foundation for the evaluation reports.\nSPE staff also write the MIDD evaluation progress and annual reports and provide data and analysis\nresults in response to ad-hoc inquiries. The team works closely with providers and BHRD MIDD program\nstaff throughout the year to review output targets and needs for adjustment.\n\nStrengths of the current evaluation process include:\n\nThe data acquisition process supports providers who have different levels of data collection and\nsharing capabilities. The evaluation team uses data submitted to King County by providers,\ngenerally on a monthly basis. The data track providers’ status toward meeting output goals specified\nin their contracts with the County. Interviewees highlighted that the decision to accept data in\nmultiple formats, even formats that are inconsistent with King County data standards, allows\nproviders who have limited expertise and/or infrastructure for collecting and sharing data to\nparticipate in MIDD. This flexibility increases the pool of providers who may participate in MIDD,\nwhich supports King County equity and social justice goals.\n\nMIDD includes dedicated resources for data cleaning, merging and analysis. Interviewees noted\nthat, due to the flexibility of submitting data in varying formats, MIDD’s dedicated resources for data\ncleaning, merging, and analysis are necessary to meeting evaluation timelines because the resources\nmake it possible to manage multiple data formats in a timely way.\n\nThis assessment also identified challenges with the evaluation process, including:\n\nData are provided in varying formats, which means King County staff spend significant time\npreparing data for analysis. Because providers submit data in multiple formats, including formats\nthat are prone to formatting errors (e.g., Microsoft Excel), the evaluation team performs\nconsiderable data cleaning and merging activities before they can analyze the data. As long as\nproviders continue to submit data in spreadsheets, manual cleaning by King County staff will be\nnecessary, despite the evaluation team’s use of computer programs to check for data errors\nelectronically after they obtain data from providers.\n\nFeared loss of funding creates a disincentive for reporting on, understanding, and learning from\nlower than anticipated performance on output and outcome measures. Interviewees reported that\nthe MIDD evaluation does not foster a continuous learning environment where strategies and/or\nprograms are adjusted or modified based on data and outcomes. Some interviewees suggested that\nthis may be due to concerns about losing funding in case of unfavorable evaluation results.\nHowever, in our assessment of MIDD evaluation and reporting, we did not find any instances of\n\n \n\nApril 14, 2016 Final Report 20",

Funding declined due to the\ndecline in sales tax revenue caused by the Great Recession, which began shortly after MIDD\nimplementation started. Less tax revenue resulted in MIDD cuts, which some believed were\ninfluenced by evaluation results.\n\nRecommendation\n\nTo address the challenges related to the evaluation process identified above, the MIDD II evaluation\nshould:\n\nR6. Invest in data collection infrastructure.\n\nAs noted, data collection, sharing, and cleaning consume considerable time, both for providers and\nthe King County evaluation team. Future evaluations will benefit from efforts to reduce manual\ndata collection and sharing, including offering resources for technical assistance with data\nreporting and/or development of data reporting systems to providers who have limited capacity\nfor data collection and sharing; involving evaluation staff and provider staff responsible for data\ncollection and sharing in contract negotiations to set realistic expectations before MIDD funds are\ndistributed; reviewing data quality on an on-going basis and providing timely feed-back to\nproviders; leveraging data requirements for the County’s Behavioral Health Integration IT project,\nin particular the electronic medical records requirement; and continuing to provide dedicated\nresources for data collection and sharing.\n\nImplementing this recommendation may increase administrative and infrastructure costs for MIDD\nll, but investing in data infrastructure may increase the capacity to use data for learning and\nimprovement and reduce the use of staff time for data management.\n\nMIDD Outcome Evaluation\n\nAs stated earlier in this report, the MIDD outcome evaluation is focused on whether MIDD-funded\nstrategies achieve expected outcomes as outlined in the Evaluation Plan. Strengths of the MIDD\noutcome evaluation, as highlighted by this assessment, include:\n\ne MIDD progress and annual reports provide detailed information on the vast majority of outcome\nmeasures listed in the MIDD Evaluation Matrix.” PSB’s review of the Evaluation Plan and all\nsubsequent annual and progress reports showed that the Evaluation Plan was closely followed\nduring implementation and that information on most outcome measures is available in the\nevaluation reports.\n\nWhere possible, the information presented in MIDD reports is based on data collected from\nindividuals before and after they started MIDD-funded services and, thus, captures changes that\noccurred while MIDD was in place. This approach answers to what extent there were changes in\noutcomes and outputs for individuals served by MIDD.\n\n® Due to lack of data, no results were reported for (a) case manager job satisfaction (Strategy 2a); (b) truancy\npetitions filed (Strategy 4c); (c) depression symptoms (Strategy 13a); and (d) job placement (Strategy 11b).

    "Page_24": "MIDD Evaluation Assessment\nFinal Report\n\nHowever, as readers of the MIDD progress and annual reports are reminded, observed changes in\noutcomes are not necessarily due to MIDD funding alone, as modifications in policing or sentencing\npractices, psychiatric hospital capacity, housing supply, or other factors in a person’s life also can\nmake a difference.\n\nAdditional observations about the outcome evaluation include:\n\ne The evaluation methodology used is not suitable to assess the causal impact of MIDD strategies\non outcomes, including MIDD policy goals. There are usually many factors that influence desired\noutcomes, many of which are outside the control of the MIDD strategies. As noted, it is, therefore,\nnot appropriate to attribute observed changes in outcome measures only to MIDD strategies.\n\nRandomized field experiments are the strongest research design for assessing the impact of an\nintervention because they provide unbiased estimates of intervention effects.*? Appendix F lists\nexamples of social service projects administered in non-research settings that use randomized\ncomparison groups to measure impact. When a randomized field experiment is not feasible due to\nethical concerns, cost considerations, or other challenges, nonrandomized quasi-experimental\ndesigns“ are often used instead. Nonrandomized quasi-experimental designs include constructed\ncontrol groups, equating groups using statistical techniques, regression-discontinuity designs and\nthe comparison of participants with themselves.”\n\nThe MIDD outcome evaluation relies mostly on what is called a simple pre-post reflexive design,\nwhich involves comparing outcomes measured for the same individuals before and after receiving\nservices through MIDD (e.g., jail utilization in the year prior to starting MIDD compared to jail\nutilization during the year after participating in MIDD). This design was approved by the King County\nCouncil and the MIDD Oversight Committee. While all quasi-experimental designs may provide\nbiased estimates “simple pre-post reflexive designs provide biased estimates of program effects that\nhave little value for purposes of impact assessment”.”° Therefore, the results of the MIDD\nevaluations cannot be used to claim or imply causality.\n\nKing County considered other types of comparisons during the MIDD, including:\n\no Ordinance 16262 directed the MIDD Oversight Committee to review and study the concept of\nestablishing a historical comparison group and make a recommendation. The Historical Control\nGroup workgroup recognized that a historical comparison group would not be appropriate to\ndetermine to what extent MIDD caused changes in the outcomes of interest. Accordingly, the\nMIDD Oversight Committee did not recommend using such a comparison group for the MIDD\nevaluation.\n\no The MIDD evaluation team attempted to use a concurrent comparison group design to assess\nwhether changes in the criminal justice system, rather than MIDD strategies alone, contributed\n\n8 List JA.

The information in the report suggests, however, that the MIDD group was not typical of\nother jail users and that the comparison group, thus, is not likely to be valid. The difficulty (or\nimpossibility) of identifying a suitable concurrent comparison group for MIDD participants may\nhave led to the decision to forego additional analyses based on a concurrent comparison group\ndesign.\n\nRecommendation\n\nTo address the challenges related to the outcome evaluation identified above, the MIDD II evaluation\ndesign should:\n\nR7.\n\nModify evaluation design if the next MIDD evaluation is to show causality.\n\nIf future evaluations are expected to establish whether MIDD-funded activities caused changes in\noutcomes, an evaluation design needs to be employed that can achieve this goal.\n\nRandom assignment is the gold standard for determining whether an intervention is the reason for\nobserved changes. As noted earlier, random assignment may not be feasible when an intervention\nis implemented outside of a research setting due to ethical concerns, cost considerations, or\nimplementation challenges.”\n\nAn alternative approach to random assignment is a concurrent comparison group design. An\nexample of a recent evaluation that used this approach is the New York City ABLE Project of\nIncarcerated Youth.’ The design requires determining: (a) characteristics that influence the\noutcome of interest (e.g., severity of crime: individuals who commit more serious crimes spend\nmore days in jail); and (b) characteristics that influence whether a person participates in a program\n(e.g., readiness to change: individuals motivated to reduce their criminal behavior are more likely\nto participate in MIDD-funded programs). Next, one needs to identify non-program participants\nwho have the same characteristics as participants (e.g., individuals with the same motivation to\nreduce criminal behavior and who committed the same types of crimes as MIDD participants). It\ncan be challenging to find the necessary data and individuals who meet these conditions.\n\nGiven the challenges of implementing evaluation designs that are suitable to establish causality\nand the significant resources such designs may require, future MIDD evaluations may want to\nweigh the advantages and disadvantages of conducting assessments that demonstrate an impact\non MIDD policy goals versus proximal outcomes. Because proximal outcomes are more directly\nlinked to activities than are policy goals, factors outside a program’s control may be less likely to\ninfluence proximal outcomes, increasing the opportunity for establishing causality between MIDD\nactivities and outcome measures.\n\n*” Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Year Three Progress Report, p.24\n\n* fa MIDD strategy uses more than one distinct program, it may be necessary to evaluate each program\nseparately to assess causal impacts with a comparison group design, which would add considerable time and\nexpense to the evaluation.\n\n4 http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/adolescent-behavioral-learning-experience-\nevaluation-rikers-island-summary.pdf\n\n \n\nApril 14, 2016 Final Report 23",
    "Page_26": "MIDD Evaluation Assessment\nFinal Report\n\nPolicymakers and county leaders should determine whether the investment in conducting causal\nevaluations is necessary and know the limitations of any selected evaluation design in\nunderstanding cause and effect.\n\nMIDD Evaluation Reporting\n\nThe evaluation team prepares the evaluation reports, which are reviewed by MIDD strategy leads, DCHS\nleadership, and County executive leadership before publication. Strengths of the evaluation reports\ninclude:\n\ne MIDD reports clearly describe to what extent strategies reached their output targets. As noted\npreviously, the objective of the Strategy Process Evaluation is to measure progress towards meeting\nthe output targets described in the MIDD evaluation matrix. The MIDD reports fulfill this objective\nby clearly reporting on output measures by strategy, which allows the reader to understand how\nmuch progress is being made toward output targets.\n\ne MIDD reports describe how MIDD funding is spent. Interviewees stated that MIDD reports include\nuseful information on how MIDD funding is being spent, such as the amount of money spent on\nindividual MIDD strategies, and the outputs that each strategy is generating, such as the number of\npeople served or the number of visits. Interviewees found the reports useful for demonstrating the\nlevel and impact of MIDD strategies to their respective organizations and to other potential funders.\n\ne The reports are accessible and readable for multiple audiences and include an effective mix of\nquantitative analysis with qualitative anecdotes and information. These qualities were praised by\ninterviewees, although interviewees also mentioned that the reports assume more background\nknowledge than readers may have. Interviewees also mentioned that they like the anecdotal\nsuccess stories included in the report because it brings meaning to numbers.\n\ne Changes in the MIDD evaluation process are captured well in the evaluation reports. A review of\nMIDD progress and annual evaluation reports by PSB found that the reports describe when there\nare changes in the evaluation matrix and changes in output measure targets. It is important to\ndocument these changes to understand how the current evaluation process relates to the original\nEvaluation Plan.\n\nIn addition, the assessment team identified challenges related to the evaluation reports, including:\n\ne Results are not available at a frequency and time to inform funding decisions and continuous\nimprovement efforts. Interviewees would like to use evaluation reports to inform funding decisions\nor continuous improvement activities. Although data are submitted at least monthly to the MIDD\nevaluation team and then analyzed and reported semi-annually, outcome results are not available\nfor a year or longer, which is partially due to outcome data being collected infrequently (e.g., at\nbaseline and 6 and 12 months post baseline). More frequent collection of outcome measures and\nmore frequent and timely reporting would provide actionable information to MIDD decision makers\nand program managers.\n\ne It is not clear why MIDD strategy process evaluation changes are made. Each MIDD strategy has\noutput targets. These targets are sometimes adjusted by the MIDD evaluation team and reported in\nthe MIDD annual and progress reports. While changes are noted, the rationale for the change is not\nconsistently provided. Interviewees explained that strategy and data improvement activities are\ngenerally managed between County contract monitors and providers, and that this level of detail is\nnot usually included in the MIDD annual and progress reports. This practice decreases the\ntransparency of the evaluation and makes it difficult to learn from the experience of the strategy\n\n \n\nApril 14, 2016 Final Report 24",
    "Page_27": "MIDD Evaluation Assessment\nFinal Report\n\nimplementation. If the reason for changing the target represents learning and improvement,\npublishing the rationale and method for the adjustment would enhance future target setting.\n\nEvaluation report drafts are reviewed and edited by multiple stakeholders, which at times has\nintroduced bias into reports. There was a perception among interviewees that County leadership,\nthe MIDD Oversight Committee, and strategy owners may focus only on positive results in the MIDD\nreports. At times, this resulted in edits to the reports that included changed wording to imply a\nstronger link between MIDD funding and results than is supported by the analyses used to derive\noutcomes. These types of edits create the same issues as noted in the finding below, in that they can\npotentially mislead readers about the results of the evaluation.\n\nIn some instances, the reports could be clearer in avoiding implications of a causal relationship\nbetween MIDD strategies and outcomes. MIDD reports include reminders that the evaluation\ndesign used for the outcome evaluation is not sufficient to determine whether MIDD was the reason\nfor an observed change. However, in some cases, the reader may infer causation due to the way\nresults are presented. For example, listing results in order of greatest change in outcome (see Figure\n2) can be interpreted to mean that some MIDD strategies are more effective than others. Since this\nconclusion would be inappropriate, ranking and sorting of MIDD results by strategy can be\nmisleading, unless the reader is reminded at this point that the evaluation design cannot establish\ncausality.\n\nFigure 2: Example of Sorted Results from MIDD Annual Report, 2015, Page 64\n\nPercentage of Eligible Participants With at Least One Community Inpatient\nPsychiatric Hospital Admit Who Reduced to Zero Admissions\n\nDuring the Long-Term Analysis Period\nSorted By Ultimate Stability Success\n0% 25% 50% 75% 100%\n\n1h-- Older Adults Crisis & Service Linkage (N= 128)\n\n1d -- Crisis Next Day Appointments (N=478)\n\n12c -- Psychiatric Emergency Services Linkage (N=111)\n1a-1a -- Mental Health Treatment (N= 654)\n\n1b -- Outreach & Engagement (N=178)\n\n3a -- Supportive Housing (N= 108)\n\n16a -- New Housing & Rental Subsidies (N=70)\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo address the challenges related to the evaluation reporting identified above, the MIDD II design\nshould:\n\nR8.\n\nIncrease frequency of performance evaluation availability.\n\nEvaluation results become available twice per year in the current MIDD evaluation process. To\nincrease the evaluation’s ability to support timely decision-making and continuous improvement\nand understanding of what is and is not working, future evaluations should consider making\n\n \n\nApril 14, 2016 Final Report 25",

If evaluation staff capacity is a\nconstraint, the scope and frequency of formal reports could be reduced due to this increased\navailability and transparency of results.\n\nThe dashboard content and format should be designed with the intended purpose of the\nevaluation and the intended audience clearly in mind, to best support decision making and\nstrategy and/or program improvement.\n\nThe value of an evaluation increases when its information is used to improve the services provided\nto improve desired outcomes.” Increasing the shared expectations about how evaluation results\nwill be used and aligning evaluation processes and the availability of evaluation results can\nincrease accountability for using data to improve strategies and/or programs in a transparent way.\n\nR9. Establish guidelines for report creators and editors on the scope of their decision\nmaking.\nRoles and responsibilities for developing and deciding upon the final content of the evaluation\nreports should be established. Reviewers and editors of the reports should clearly understand the\nscope of their editing role, and all edits should be reviewed by the person responsible for finalizing\ncontent before publishing information.\n\nIn addition, decisions about which evaluation results to publish should be made before results are\nknown, and significant results should be reported on, whether favorable or unfavorable. These\nchanges will help maintain the objectivity of future MIDD evaluation reporting.\n\nR10. Avoid presenting non-causal results in ways that imply causality.\n\nIf an evaluation design suitable for causal inference is not feasible for future MIDD evaluations, the\ndescription of evaluation results needs to avoid the impression that MIDD is causally related to\nchanges in outcomes. When results are presented in a way that may imply causality, at a\nminimum, the reader should be reminded that the evaluation design cannot establish causality.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis assessment of the MIDD evaluations conducted from 2008-2015 found that there are many\nstrengths to build upon. These evaluations provided information for stakeholders and the community to\nunderstand how MIDD funding was spent and the progress made toward the targets and goals identified\nin the MIDD Evaluation Plan. Additionally, this assessment identified some challenges and an evolution\nin behavioral health care evaluation that will need to be considered as the new evaluation plan is\ndeveloped for potential MIDD renewal. It may be beneficial for the development of the next MIDD\nevaluation to build upon these learnings and consider the recommendations in this report.\n\n°° w dashboard provides the current status of an organization’s key indicators in an easy-to-read format using a\nreal-time computer user interface.\n\n5” Kinney AS, Mucha MH, eds.

Strategy Process Evaluation\n\nThe objective of the Strategy Process Evaluation is to measure progress towards meeting the output\ngoals specified in the MIDD evaluation matrix of the MIDD Evaluation Plan (see Appendix D). The\nStrategy Process Evaluation focuses on program reporting to provide transparency to constituents that\nfunds are being used as intended. The Strategy Process Evaluation is available upon request.\n\nOutput measures were adjusted over time based on input from evaluation staff, providers and the MIDD\nOversight Committee to reflect changes in MIDD strategies, strategy implementation or data availability.\nAny changes to the measures are published in MIDD progress reports and must be adopted by the\nCouncil to become official.\n\n3.

For each MIDD strategy, this entails selecting outcome measures that reflect the\nexpected results, collecting data for each measure at multiple points in time for individuals served by\nMIDD, analyzing data to determine whether there were changes over time and publishing results in the\nMIDD annual and progress reports.\n\nProximal measures selected for the MIDD Outcome Evaluation address behaviors, skills, knowledge,\nattitudes, and external circumstances relevant for individuals served by MIDD. Examples include\nscreening for mental health and chemical dependency symptoms, symptom severity, enrolling in mental\nhealth treatment, skills and knowledge obtained in crisis intervention training, attitudes about stigma\nassociated with mental health illness and risk factors impacting families and youth served by MIDD. The\nselected distal outcome measures reflect behavior and address jail utilization, emergency room visits\nand hospital use, that is, MIDD policy goals (1) through (4).\n\nMIDD Evaluation Reporting\n\nOrdinance 15949 also specified what type of evaluation reporting would occur and when.\n\n“In addition to reviewing and approving the parts one, two and three of the oversight, implementation\nand evaluation plan outlined in subsection C. of this section, in coordination with the oversight group, the\nexecutive shall submit four quarterly progress reports and an one annual summary report for the\n\n \n\nApril 14, 2016 Final Report 34",

The quarterly reports shall include at a\nminimum:\n\na. performance measurement statistics;\n\nb. program utilization statistics;\n\nc. request for proposal and expenditure status updates; and\n\nd. progress reports on evaluation implementation.\n\n2.a. The quarterly reports to the council are due to the council March 1, June 1, September 1 and\nDecember 1 for council review for years one and two and thereafter, every six months.\n\nb.(1) The annual report to the council shall be submitted to the council by April 1, for council\nreview. The annual report shall also include:\n\n(a) a summary of quarterly report data;\n(b) updated performance measure targets for the following year of the programs; and\n\n(c) recommendations on program and/or process changes to the funded programs based on\nthe measurement and evaluation data.” (pp. 8-9)\n\nCurrently, the results of the evaluation work are published twice per year in two reports. The MIDD\nAnnual Report, published in February of each year and transmitted to the Council with a motion to\naccept the report, summarizes the findings of the evaluation work for the most recent October-\nSeptember time period. Each report includes:\n\ne Asummary of the MIDD strategies that operated during the time period being evaluated\ne Areminder of MIDD background, policy goals, and Oversight Committee membership\n\ne The number of individuals served by type of service, as well as demographic information such as\nage, gender, race, and geography\n\ne Asummary of how each strategy progressed toward its output measurement targets during the\nperiod being evaluated\n\ne Asummary of outcome progress achieved by MIDD programs during the period being evaluated\n\ne Recommendations for revisions to the Evaluation Plan for future evaluations to respond to changing\nservices and information over time\n\ne A financial report comparing budget to actual spending for the period being evaluated\nThe MIDD Progress Report, published in August of each year, contains much of the same information as\n\nthe annual report for the most recent October-March time period, as a way to check in on progress\nbetween annual reports.

While many good logic models exist that show a flow from inputs to outcomes (see\nFigure 4 on next page), the best logic models ensure that each element is measurable and that there is\nevidence to believe there is a relationship between the elements.\n\nA logic model is the foundation for an actionable plan that includes strategies with clearly defined\noutcomes and explicit steps for addressing the problems that were identified. Logic models describe the\nsequence of activities that is expected to bring about change and how the activities are linked to the\ndesired results. The process of thinking through change includes:\n\n1) Identifying the problem(s): What is the community need?\n\n2) Naming the desired results: What is the vision for the future?\n\n3) Developing the strategies for achieving desired results: How can the vision be achieved?\n\nHaving an actionable plan is essential for successful program implementation, continuous improvement\nactivities, a useful evaluation, and, ultimately for accomplishing the desired results.\n\n \n\nApril 14, 2016 Final Report 64",

Conducting an evaluation with random assignment in a non-research setting can be\nchallenging for a number of reasons, including ethical concerns (e.g., do services need to be withheld for\nsome participants?), cost considerations (e.g., is money available to conduct such an evaluation?), or\nimplementation challenges (e.g., will randomized groups ‘contaminate’ each other?).\n\nHowever, tight budgets and the desire to allocate public resources equitably have increased the need to\nknow whether public-sector programs have their intended impact. As a result, random assignment is\nbeing used more often in evaluations of public-sector projects. Below are examples of projects that\nincorporated random assignment into their evaluation design. The examples are from the Pay for\nSuccess model, which leverages private funding up-front to ensure jurisdictions only pay for services\nwhen specified outcomes are met. Project details are available from the Nonprofit Finance Fund.**\n\ne Connecticut Family Stability Pay for Success Project\n\nLed by the Connecticut Department of Children and Families and its partners, this project aims to\npromote family stability and reduce parental substance use for 500 families. The University of\nConnecticut Health Center leads the evaluation using a randomized controlled trial approach, which\nis described in the program documentation as “the gold standard for a rigorous evaluation.”\n\ne South Carolina Nurse-Family Partnership Pay for Success Project\n\nFocused on improving health outcomes for mothers and children living in poverty, this project\nextends the Nurse-Family Partnership services to 3,200 low-income mothers in the state. The\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology J-PAL North America leads the evaluation using a randomized\ncontrolled trial to determine whether the project meets its identified goals.”\n\ne New York State Recidivism and Workforce Development Project\n\nThis project focuses on reducing recidivism and increasing employment for 2,000 formerly\nincarcerated individuals in New York City and Rochester, New York. The evaluation for this project\nalso uses a randomized controlled trial.**\n\ne The Denver Social Impact Bond Program\n\nThis project will provide housing and supportive case management services to at least 250 homeless\nindividuals who are frequent users of the city’s emergency services, such as police, jail, the courts,\nand emergency rooms. Eligible individuals will be randomly assigned to one of two groups — one\ngroup receives supportive housing as part of the initiative and another group “usual care” services.”\n\nList JA.

    "Page_75": "ia King County\n\nMental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Mental Illness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) Action Plan and the Metropolitan\nKing County Council Ordinance 15949 define the expectations for the MIDD evaluation.\nThe Ordinance calls for the plan to describe how the MIDD will be evaluated in terms of\nits impact and benefits and whether the MIDD achieves its goals. It requires that:\n\n“..the evaluation plan shall describe an evaluation and reporting plan for the\nprograms funded with the sales tax revenue. Part three [the Evaluation Plan]\nshall specify: process and outcome evaluation components; a proposed schedule\nfor evaluations; performance measurements and performance measurement\ntargets; and data elements that will be used for reporting and evaluations.”\n\nThe primary goal of the MIDD is to:\n\nPrevent and reduce chronic homelessness and unnecessary involvement in the\ncriminal justice and emergency medical systems and promote recovery for\npersons with disabling mental illness and chemical dependency by implementing\na full continuum of treatment, housing, and case management services.\n\nThe Ordinance identified five policy goals:\n\n1. A reduction in the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent people\nusing costly interventions like jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals\n\n2. A reduction in the number of people who recycle through the jail, returning\nrepeatedly as a result of their mental illness or chemical dependency\n\n3. A reduction of the incidence and severity of chemical dependency and mental\nand emotional disorders in youth and adults\n\n4, Diversion of mentally ill and chemically dependent youth and adults from\ninitial or further justice system involvement\n\n5. Explicit linkage with, and furthering the work of, other council directed\nefforts including, the Adult and Juvenile Justice Operational Master plans, the\nPlan to End Homelessness, the Veterans and Human Services Levy Service\nImprovement Plan and the King County Mental Health Recovery Plan.\n\nIn the MIDD Action Plan, the MIDD Oversight Committee, the Mental Health, Chemical\nAbuse and Dependency Services Division (MHCADSD) and its stakeholders identified\nsixteen core strategies and corresponding sub-strategies (see A ppendix for a list and\ndescription of strategies) for service improvement, enhancement and expansion to\naddress these goals. The Evaluation Plan will examine the impact of all strategies to\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 1 of 10",

Results from the ongoing\nevaluation will be regularly reported on though quarterly and annual reports that will be\nreviewed by the MIDD Oversight Committee and transmitted to the King County\nExecutive and Metropolitan King County Council. It also should be noted that the\nEvaluation Plan will evolve and change as the strategies evolve and change. Changes to\nthe Evaluation Plan will be included in the regular reports as described above.\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATION PLAN\nMIDD Framework\n\nThe MIDD Evaluation Plan establishes a framework for evaluating each of the 16 core\nstrategies and sub-strategies in the MIDD Implementation Plan, by measuring what is\ndone (output), how it is done (process), and the effects of what is done (outcome).\nMeasuring what is done entails determining if the service has occurred. Measuring how\nan intervention is done is more complex and may involve a combination of contract\nmonitoring, as well as process and outcome evaluation to determine if a program is being\nimplemented as intended. Measuring the effects of what is done is also complex, and will\nrequire the use of both basic quantitative and qualitative methods as appropriate\n\nThe evaluation framework ties the MIDD goals and strategies to the MIDD results. It\nlays out the links between what is funded, what is expected to happen as a result of those\nfunds, and how those results will contribute to realizing the MIDD goals and objectives.\nThe schematic diagram below shows the high level relationships between the components\nof the framework.\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 2 of 10",

Multiple and oftentimes interrelated interventions are\ndesigned to achieve the policy goals (e.g., reducing caseloads, increasing funding,\nenhancing workforce development activities and service capacity are expected to\ncollectively reduce incarceration and use of emergency services). Many of the outcomes\nexpected from the MIDD interventions are highly correlated to each other. For example,\na decrease in mental health symptoms can lead to a decrease in crisis episodes, which can\nlead to a decrease in incarcerations, which can lead to an increase in housing stability,\nwhich can lead to a further decrease in mental health symptoms, and so on. Interventions\nthat have an impact on any one of these outcomes can therefore be expected to have some\nimpact on the other outcomes. The specifics of each intervention and the population it is\ntargeting will determine which outcome(s) will be impacted in the short-term and how\nmuch additional time will be necessary before other longer-term outcomes will be seen.\n(Examples of longer term outcomes include reduction in jail recidivism and/or re-\nhospitalizations, or prevention of substance abuse in children of substance abusing\n\nparents.)\n\n1. Process Evaluation\n\n \n\nThe first component of the MIDD evaluation is a process evaluation that will assess\nhow the MIDD is being implemented at both the system and strategy levels.\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 3 of 10",

System Process Evaluation\n\nThe system process evaluation will provide a general assessment of how\nimplementation is progressing. Sometimes referred to as an ‘implementation\nstatus report’, this type of evaluation may also answer specific programmatic\nquestions (e. g., “How can we improve the quality of training for chemical\ndependency specialists?\").\n\nThe system process evaluation will examine:\n\n¢ Initial startup activities (e.g., acquiring space, hiring and training staff,\ndeveloping policies and procedures)\n\n« Development and management of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and\ncontracts for services\n\n¢ Strategies to leverage and blend multiple funding streams\n¢ Efforts to coordinate the work of partners, stakeholders, and providers\n\n¢ Implementation of working agreements and Memoranda of\nUnderstanding\n\n¢ Service-level changes that occur as the result of efforts to promote\nintegration of housing, treatment, and supportive services\n\n« Systems-level changes that occur as a result of the use of MIDD funds or\nthe management of MIDD related resources\n\n@ An evaluation of the MIDD Action Plan’s integration with and support of\nsystem level goals and objectives, as articulated in the Adult and Juvenile\nJustice Operational Master plans, the Plan to End Homelessness, the\nVeterans and Human Services Levy Service Improvement Plan and the\nKing County Mental Health Recovery Plan.\n\nThe goal of the system process evaluation is not only to capture what actually\nhappens as the MIDD is implemented, but also to identify the unintended\nconsequences of MIDD activities (e.g., circumstances that were not anticipated or\nwere unusual in ways that helped or hindered MIDD-related work).\n\nThe system process evaluation establishes a quality improvement feedback loop\nas implementation progresses. Areas needing additional effort will be identified\nin order to make any needed mid-course adjustments.

These performance measures and goals are specified as outputs in the\nevaluation matrices at the end of the document (See A ppendix).\n\n2. Outcome Evaluation\n\nThe outcome evaluation will assess the impact of the funded services and programs\non the MIDD goals. This approach consists of evaluating the full range of program\noutcomes in the context of a logical framework. The evaluation matrix designed for\nthis part of the evaluation links the MIDD goals and strategies to the MIDD results\nand provides a structure for identifying performance indicators, targets and data\nsources, and for collecting and reporting results.\n\nThe MIDD outcome evaluation is broader than a program evaluation or a series of\nprogram evaluations. The framework defines the expected outcomes for each\nprogram and helps demonstrate how these outcomes individually and collectively\ncontribute to the achievement of the overall goals of the MIDD.\n\nA. Strategies\n\nEvaluating the impact of the MIDD Action Plan is a multifaceted endeavor.\n\nThere are multiple target populations, goals, strategies, programs, interventions,\nproviders, administrators, partners, locations, timelines, and expected results. The\ncomprehensive evaluation strategy is designed to demonstrate whether the\nexpected results are being achieved and whether value is retuned on MIDD\ninvestments.\n\nUnderlying principles for the outcome evaluation include:\n\n¢ The evaluation will build upon existing evaluation activities and\ncoordinate with current and/or developing information systems (e.g.,\nStrategy 7b, expanded Children’s Crisis Outreach Response System).\n\n« When the implementation of a strategy will take multiple years, making it\nimpossible to immediately demonstrate any long-term outcomes, the\nevaluation will establish intermediate outcomes to show that the strategy\nis on course to achieve results (e.g., Strategy 4b, Prevention Services to\nChildren of Substance A busers).\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 5 of 10",
    "Page_80": "ia King County\n\nMental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan\n\n¢ The evaluation will coordinate its activities with MIDD administrative\nactivities, including RFPs, contract management, etc. Process and\noutcome data collection will be incorporated into ongoing monitoring\nfunctions and will support regional coordination of data collection.\n\nThe MIDD Action Plan specifies that the MIDD dollars be used to fund effective\npractices and strategies. Evaluation approaches can range from purely verifying\nthat something happened to comparing intervention results with a statistically\nvalid control group to ascertain causality. The MIDD evaluation will utilize the\nstrongest and also the most feasible evaluation design for each strategy.\n\n¢ An-evaluation that requires a control group to prove that a program is the\ncause of any effects can be expensive and time consuming. In general, it\nwill not be possible for an evaluation of most MIDD programs to include\na control or comparison group to show a causal relationship. Establishing\na control or comparison group would require that some individuals not\nreceive services so that they can be compared with those who receive\nservices. However, there may be situations when a ‘natural’ comparison\n\ngroup may be used if feasible.\n\n¢ A proven program, such as an evidence-based practice, has already had an\nevaluation utilizing a control or comparison group. When the MIDD\nstrategies fund practices and services that are currently working or have\nbeen proven to work elsewhere, there is no need to again prove a causal\nrelationship. Instead, the evaluation will focus on measuring the quantity\nand results of MIDD funded services, in addition to their adherence to\nfidelity measures.\n\n¢ Formany strategies a proven program and/or best practice will be\nsubstantially modified in order to be useful to the specific populations\ntargeted by the MIDD. Evaluation of these programs will stress on-going\nmonitoring and early feedback so that any necessary changes can take\nplace in a timely manner. Short-term results will be identified as a\nmarker of which longer-term desired outcomes are likely to be detected.\nThis formative type of evaluation will help ensure that the program is\nfunctioning as intended.\n\nB. Evaluation Matrix\nOrganizing an evaluation as complex as this requires a systematic approach. An\n\nevaluation matrix has been designed for compiling the needed information for\neach sub-strategy. Completed evaluation matrices for each sub-strategy specify\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 6 of 10",

When strategies are further developed or modified\nfollowing initial implementation, new or revised outcomes will be developed, and\nincluded in the quarterly reports.\n\nADDENDUM: EVALUATION APPROACH\n\nThe MIDD Evaluation Plan was developed in the context of existing quality management\napproaches currently utilized by the Department of Community and Human Services\n(DCHS) and the Mental Health, Chemical A buse and Dependency Services Division\n(MHCADSD). MHCADSD is responsible for the publicly funded mental health and\nsubstance abuse treatment systems, and as such is obligated to assure the quality,\nappropriateness, availability and cost effectiveness of treatment services. MHCADSD\nmust demonstrate to federal, state, and county government the capacity to operate and\nmonitor a complex network of service providers. This is accomplished through well-\nestablished quality assurance and improvement strategies, including contract\ndevelopment and monitoring, setting expectations for performance, conducting periodic\nreview of performance, and offering continuous feedback to providers regarding\nsuccesses and needed improvements. In that context, all MIDD contracts will specify\nwhat the provider is expected to do, including service provision, data submission, and\nreporting of key deliverables. The MIDD evaluation will extend beyond the contract\nmonitoring process to assess whether services were performed effectively, and whether\nthey resulted in improved outcomes for the individuals involved in those services.\n\nThe MIDD Evaluation Plan was developed by MHCADSD program evaluation staff\nwhose collective experience with program evaluation, performance measurement,\nresearch, and quality improvement is summarized in Attachment B. The MHCADSD\nSystem Performance Evaluation team will continue to provide leadership and staffing to\nassure that the evaluation proceeds in a timely and transparent manner. The ongoing\nevaluation of the MIDD will involve coordination with MIDD Oversight Committee,\nstakeholders, providers, and other agencies responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of\nrelated or overlapping programs (Veteran’s and Human Services Levy Service\nImprovement Plan, Committee to End Homelessness, Public Health of Seattle/King\nCounty, United Way Blueprint to End Chronic Homelessness, City of Seattle, University\nof Washington, etc.).\n\nThe Evaluation Plan and the evaluation matrices for each individual strategy were\ndeveloped directly from the individual implementation strategies. Some strategies are\nstill in the process of being developed; therefore the evaluation matrices for those\nstrategies will need to be revised as plans are finalized. Updates to the Evaluation Plan\nwill be included in the quarterly, bi-annual, and annual reports reviewed by the MIDD\nOversight Committee and transmitted to the King County Executive and Metropolitan\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 9 of 10",
    "Page_84": "ia King County\n\nMental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan\n\nKing County Council. The Plan utilizes a basic approach to evaluation: measure what is\ndone (output), how it is done (process), and the effects of what is done (outcome).\n\n« Measuring what is done is usually straightforward, as it entails determining if the\nservice has occurred. For example, Strategy 1d aims to increase access to “next\nday” appointments for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. The\nevaluation will determine whether the program met its target of increasing\navailability of next day appointments for an additional 750 people.\n\n¢ Measuring how an intervention is done is more complex and may involve a\ncombination of contract monitoring (MHCADSD contract staff review agency\npolicies and procedures, client charts, staff credentials, billing, etc.), and process\nand outcome evaluation to determine if a program is being implemented as\nintended.\n\n¢ Measuring the effects of what is done can vary in complexity. The outcome\nevaluation of MIDD activities will utilize basic quantitative and qualitative\nmethods as appropriate. Many outcome indicators are a measurement of change.\nThe Evaluation Plan uses terms such as ‘increase’, ‘decrease’, ‘expand’ or\n‘improve’-- all of which imply a difference from what was happening before the\nintervention occurred. Baseline data will be needed in order to measure whether\nthere has been any change. Targets for improvement will vary, depending on\nwhat is currently happening (e.g., percentage of individuals receiving mental\nhealth services who are employed) and how long it will take to see results, taking\ninto account the combined impact of all the MIDD strategies.\n\nData collected on performance will offer a rich opportunity to analyze how the MIDD\nstrategies are impacting people throughout the county, in parts of the county, and at\nspecific providers. Every effort will be made to utilize existing data and reports to avoid\nunnecessary administrative burden. Through both ongoing contract monitoring and\nevaluation activities providers will receive feedback about the effectiveness of their\nstrategies and will be held accountable to make any needed changes to ensure the\nexpected results are achieved over time. Monitoring and evaluation results will be used\nto support quality improvements and revisions to MIDD strategies, to highlight\nsuccesses, and to demonstrate cost effectiveness to the taxpayer.\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 10 of 10",

    "Page_86": "ia King County\n\nMental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan\n\nProposed Targets for Key MIDD Policy Goals\n\nAt the request of the Operating Budget, Fiscal Management, and Select Issues Committee\nand the Regional Policy Committee, King County Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and\nDependency Services Division (MHCADSD) has established targets for key Mental\nIllness and Drug Dependency Action Plan (MIDD) policy goals established in King\nCounty Council Ordinance 15949.\n\nThe target areas addressed here include: (a) a reduction in the number of jail\nbookings/detentions for individuals served in MIDD programs, (b) a reduction in the jail\ndetention population with serious mental illness (SMI) or severe emotional disturbance\n(SED), (c) a reduction in homelessness as measured by formerly homeless adults served\nby MIDD housing programs who remain in stable housing after one year, (d) a reduction\nin emergency room visits among individuals served by MIDD programs, and (e) a\nreduction in inpatient psychiatric hospital admissions among individuals served by MIDD\nprograms. As identified in County Ordinance 15949, the outcomes presented here are\nexplicitly linked to the following MIDD policy goals:\n\no A reduction in the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent\npeople using costly interventions like jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals\n\no A reduction in the number of people who recycle through the jail,\nreturning repeatedly as a result of their mental illness or chemical\ndependency\n\no Diversion of mentally ill and chemically dependent youth and adults from\ninitial or further justice system involvement\n\nTargets for the broad MIDD policy goals were established based on the assumption that a\nset of programs has been up and running for one full year and has enrolled enough\nparticipants to detect significant changes. The programs within the MIDD strategies will\nbuild on each other and also improve over time and as such, targets will change over\ntime. Some of the programs that we expect to have the largest impact (e.g., housing and\ncrisis diversion) will be fully implemented anywhere from one to four years after other\nprograms have been in operation. We have therefore developed targets that change over\ntime, as programs develop and increase effectiveness and as more programs come on\nline.\n\nWe have based the development of our outcome targets on information we have from\nprograms serving populations similar to those served by MIDD, and on program results\nfrom similar programs across the country. There are, however, a number of factors that\ncannot be predicted but may directly influence whether the anticipated targets are\nachieved. Factors such as changes in law enforcement policies and funding, significant\nchanges in the economy, changes in Federal entitlement and housing funding and\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 12 of 10",
    "Page_87": "ia King County\n\nMental Illness and Drug Dependency Action Plan\n\npolicies, state funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment, and population\ngrowth may affect the number of jail admissions regardless of MIDD strategy\nimplementation. Furthermore, there are a number of local and state initiatives that\ndirectly influence outcomes associated with the MIDD. For example, the MacArthur\nModels for Change Initiative is focusing on juvenile justice reform; the King County\nSystems Integration Initiative is addressing issues of coordination, collaboration, and\nblending resources for multi-system youth; and the Ten-year Plan to End Homelessness\nand the Veterans and Human Services Levy are working to increase the availability of\nhousing and services for homeless individuals. Consistent with the fifth policy goal, the\nMIDD Evaluation will track coordination and linkage with these other Council directed\nefforts through a process evaluation.\n\nBaseline Data\n\nIn some cases, sufficient baseline data for some of the subsets of the five policy goals\nacross all of King County does not exist. Such baseline data will be established during\nthe first year of full strategy implementation. Data sharing agreements will be executed\nwith many municipalities and entities in order to create a comprehensive baseline to\nensure accurate baseline estimates and to continue to collect such data on an ongoing\nbasis to monitor targeted outcomes. For example, baseline data on particular populations\nwill include youth with mental health disorders in King County Juvenile Detention and\nadults with SMI in jails across King County.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nMonitoring and evaluation results will be used to support quality improvements and\nrevisions to MIDD strategies, to highlight successes, and to demonstrate cost\neffectiveness to the taxpayer.\n\nThese targets may be adjusted to account for changes in program implementation.\nMonitoring outcomes at short-term, intermediate, and long-term phases will allow us to\nmake changes in program implementation based on the targeted outcomes.\n\nAs programs in the MIDD Implementation Plan are implemented and evolve over time,\nthe Evaluation Plan will be updated accordingly to accurately measure the effectiveness\nand impact of each individual strategy.\n\nTests for statistical significance will be used to address the question: What is the\nprobability that the relationship between variables (e.g., MIDD program and an outcome)\nis due to chance? The influence of certain known factors that may bias the results, such as\nattrition and population growth, will be examined.\n\nMIDD Evaluation Plan\nPage 13 of 10",

The PSS is an inventory used to assess the functioning\nlevel for adults in a number of life domains. Scores on the clinician-rated\ninstrument are assigned to each dimension from 0 — Above Average:\nArea of strength relative to average to 5 — Extreme impairment: Out of\ncontrol, unacceptable. The PSS assesses 14 dimensions, including\nsymptoms of depression, anxiety, psychosis (thought disorders), and\ndissociation (unreality). The PSS also notes cognitive impairment.\n\n \n\nChildren’s Functional\nAssessment Rating Scale\n(CFARS)\n\nCFARS is a clinician-rated tool used for standardizing impressions from\nassessment of cognitive, social, and role functioning in children/youth. It\nincludes measures for 16 domains, including depression and anxiety.\nRatings are assigned using a 9-point scale where 1 is “no problem” and 9\nis a “severe problem.”\n\n \n\nAddiction Severity Index\n(ASI)\n\nThe ASI is a semi-structured interview for substance abuse assessment\nand treatment planning. The ASI is designed to gather valuable\ninformation about areas of a client's life that may contribute to their\nsubstance-abuse problems.\n\n \n\nPHQ-9 (part of the Patient\nHealth Questionnaire)\n\nThe PHQ-9 has cut points of 5, 10, and 15 to indicate mild, moderate,\nand severe levels. Symptom reduction is analyzed by comparing changes\nin instrument scores within individuals over time. Questions from the\nPHQ-9 assess patient mood, sleeping patterns, energy, appetite,\nconcentration, and thoughts of suicide, among others.\n\n \n\nGeneralized Anxiety\nDisorder (GAD-7)\n\nThe GAD-7provides an index to gauge patient anxiety levels. It has cut\npoints of 5, 10, and 15 to indicate mild, moderate, and severe levels.\nSymptom reduction is analyzed by comparing changes in instrument\nscores within individuals over time. The GAD-7 includes questions about\nfeeling worried, nervous, restless, annoyed, or afraid.\n\n \n\nGlobal Appraisal of\nIndividual Needs —\nShort Screener (GAIN-SS)\n\nThe GAIN-SS, while not designed as a symptom reduction measure, is\nused to screen clients for behavioral health issues. It serves as a periodic\nmeasure of behavioral health change over time.\n\n \n\nGlobal Appraisal of\nIndividual Needs Initial\n(GAIN-I)\n\nThe GAIN-I has sections covering background, substance use, physical\nhealth, risk behaviors and disease prevention, mental and emotional\nhealth, environment and living situation, legal, and vocational. Within\nthese sections are questions that address problems, services, client\nattitudes and beliefs, and the client's desire for services.

Of those with baseline scores Page 36\n\nabove the clinical threshold for concern, 67 percent reduced depression symptoms,\n61 percent reduced anxiety, and half reduced traumatic stress.\n\nBaseline PSS data for 2,719 people showed that many MIDD participants are\n\nseverely impaired by depression (27%) or anxiety (21%). Of the 1,044 whose\n\nanxiety symptoms changed over time, 884 (85%) showed some improvement. Of ,\n\nthe 767 people with the most severe depression during their pre period, 179 Fifth Annual Report February 2013\n(23%) had only slight or no impairment during at least one subsequent measure. Page 60\n\nThe average time associated with symptom reduction was about 15 months\n\nbetween measures.\n\nAnalysis of baseline PSS scores for 5,364 clients showed response to stress,\ndepression, anxiety, and social withdrawal to have the highest incidence of severe\nto extreme impairment. Of the 3,026 people who had PSS data at baseline and\neach of the next three years, the percentage who reduced their symptoms in these\nfour categories grew over time. All incremental and long-term improvements were\n\nstatistically significant. Seventh Annual Report\n\nPage 59 February 2015\nAmong the 629 youth and children with CFARS ratings, depression and anxiety\n\nwere again the most problematic from a symptoms standpoint. Improvements in\n\nseverity over time were noted, although youth with extreme issues were very rare\n\n(less than one percent in any functional domain).\n\n1a-2a Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Outpatient Treatment\n\nIn July 2011, SUD treatment providers were required to submit “periodic\n\nmilestone” data for the purpose of measuring symptom reduction in adults over Year 4 Progress Report\ntime. Over 2,500 of these Addiction Severity Index (ASI) records had been Page 23\nentered, but were unavailable for download from the State of Washington.\n\nAugust 2012\n\nFor 2,699 adults in outpatient SUD treatment, the top three drugs were: alcohol\n\n(55%), marijuana (25%), and cocaine (6%). For those with primary alcohol use,\n\n128 of 499 (26%) reduced their use to abstinence by the second measure (usually | _ Fifth Annual Report February 2013\none year later). The abstinence rate for marijuana was 24 percent and for cocaine Page 11\n\nit was 20 percent.\n\nSubstance use symptom reduction was studied for 195 youth enrolled in MIDD-\n\nfunded SUD treatment using Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) data.\n\nMarijuana was the drug of choice for the majority of these youth. Combined with\n\nyouth from other MIDD strategies, marijuana use “in the past 90 days” fell Sixth Annual Report\nsignificantly from 40 days (pre) to 33 days (post). Average days without substance Page 55\n\nuse rose significantly over time and the average days spent drunk or high declined\n\nby 22 percent.
