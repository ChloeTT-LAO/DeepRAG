Why?\n\nPoor performance of\nagricultural sector in\nparticular\n\nGovernment looks to shift\npolicy emphasis towards\nsmallholder agriculture\n\n \n\n \n\nOverview\n\n \n\nPapua New Guinea has many of the signs of a newly independent\ndeveloping economy on the move. Leading up to and following its\nIndependence from Australia in September 1975, its trade, particularly\nexports, has diversified away from Australia, the monetized sector of\nthe economy has expanded substantially, the overwhelming reliance\non agriculture has moderated and the dependence on foreign aid is\ngradually falling (see Garnaut and Baxter 1983; Goodman, Lepani and\nMorawetz 1985).Moreover, two spectacular copper mines have been\nsuccessfully developed — Bougainville from the early 1970s and Ok\nTedi from the early 1980s — and another series of gold and petroleum\ndevelopments are in prospect for the 1990s.Largely as a result of\nBougainville, the value of Papua New Guinea’s exports at constant\nprices quadrupled between 1971 and 1976.\n\nYet, despite all these signs of economic progress in Papua New\nGuinea, the average income in this resource rich economy has not\ngrown.In fact, for the vast majority of the population still living in\nvillages, real incomes may well have declined during the first decade of\nIndependence, a period when food production per capita fell by an\nestimated 7 per cent.Moreover, urban unemployment has become\nserious in recent years.\n\nThis disappointing growth performance has led the government to\nreassess its policies and priorities.Why have living standards not risen\nduring the past decade or so?In particular, why has agriculture per-\nformed so poorly?If another minerals export boom eventuates in the\n1990s, will that leave the country too vulnerable to multinational com-\npanies and to the vagaries of international market fluctuations?Will it\nease or exacerbate urban unemployment problems?Will it make\nPapua New Guinea more dependent on imports of food?The latter is a\nparticular concern of former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan\nwho, according to Gupta and Polume (1984:8), believes it is a ‘national\nshame’ that such a land-abundant country cannot completely feed\nitself.\n\nWith these questions in mind, the Papua New Guinea government is\nlooking to shift its policy emphasis toward smallholder agriculture. The\nmultiple aims of such a change, as perceived by the government, are\nto:\n\na boost incomes in rural areas;",
    "Page_13": "xiv\n\nAims of this study\n\nThe pattern of economic\nchange since the 1970s:\nthe relative decline of\nagriculture\n\nEffects of the mineral\nexport boom\n\nGROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC POLICY\n\no diversify and expand the monetized part of the economy and thereby\nbroaden the domestic tax base so that the government can reduce\nits dependence on foreign aid;\n\na expand export earnings to help meet the country’s rapidly expanding\ndebt service obligations;\n\no alleviate the problems associated with high urban unemployment;\nreduce the country’s dependence on food imports; and\n\no reduce dependence on multinational companies and international\nmarkets for export earnings.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the impact of recent economic\ngrowth, structural changes and policies on the role that agriculture —\nparticularly smallholder agriculture — has played in Papua New\nGuinea's development.This is an essential step in the process of\nassessing alternative development strategies the government might\nadopt in the years ahead.\n\nThe study is in four parts.The first documents the extent of Papua\nNew Guinea’s economic growth and structural changes since the\n1960s and the contribution of those developments to agriculture’s\nrelative decline during that period.They are not the only reason for\nagriculture’s poor growth performance, however.Much of the explana-\ntion has to do with government policies. The second analyses the\neffects of policies which alter the incentives faced by farmers in both\nfactor and product markets.The third examines the role played by\npublic investment in technology, human resources and infrastructure in\nthe rural sector.Finally, lessons and key policy implications are drawn\nfrom the recent past, and a list is provided of some of the priority areas\nwhere further economic analysis could improve public debate.\n\nBy global standards the aggregate economic growth of Papua New\nGuinea has been very slow since the mid 1970s.Yet the growth in\nexport volumes and the extent of inter-sectoral change in the structure\nof its economy — typically indicators that are highly correlated with the\nrate of economic growth — are shown in Chapter 1 to have been equal\nto or, in the case of exports, well above the average for developing\ncountries.Even after adjusting for a one-third deterioration in the\ncountry’s terms of trade, its exports in 1986 were able to buy three\ntimes as many imports as in 1970 and ten times as many as in\n1965.Large-scale mining began only in the early 1970s, but by the end\nof that decade minerals accounted for one-eighth of national income\nand half of the country’s export earnings.Meanwhile, agriculture’s\nshare of national product fell from 42 to 34 per cent and its share of\nexports fell from more than 90 per cent to just 40 per cent between the\nlate 1960s and 1986.One in four workers had non-agricultural jobs by\n1980, compared with only one in ten in the early 1960s.\n\nThe relative decline of agriculture in Papua New Guinea has four sets\nof explanations.First, this is something that tends to happen, to\nsome extent at least, in all economies in the course of national and global\neconomic growth, for reasons spelt out in the first part of Chapter 2.",
    "Page_14": "OVERVIEW\n\nGovernment policies\naffecting the agricultural\nsector\n\nProblems with the land\ntenure system\n\nxv\n\nSecond, agriculture’s decline was accentuated in Papua New Guinea\nbecause of the construction of the massive Bougainville and Ok Tedi\nmine sites — financed largely by foreign capital inflows — and the\nsubsequent boom in mineral exports. The consequent real appreciation\nin the value of Papua New Guinea’s currency reduced the competitive-\nness of other sectors producing tradables or goods such as perishable\nfood staples for which there are close substitutes which are\ntradable.The effects of this second set of forces on agriculture are\nanalysed in the latter part of Chapter 2.\n\nThe other two sets of explanations for the relative decline of agriculture\n— and for the economy's overall sluggishness — have to do with\ngovernment policies.One set is concerned with policies affecting incen-\ntives faced by farmers and other producers in factor and product\nmarkets (Chapters 3 to 5).The other relates to public investments in\ntechnology, human capital and infrastructure which affect both rural\nand non-rural output and productivity (Chapters 6 and 7).\n\nPolicies affecting agricultural incentives involve much more than\nwhat are typically called agricultural policies. They include policies af-\nfecting markets for land, labour and financial capital, since these have\nan important bearing on costs of agricultural production and on the\nsupply of resources to agriculture.They also include trade and ex-\nchange rate policies, which affect the kina value of agricultural\nproducts both directly and indirectly, and taxation policies which in-\nfluence the net return to producers.\n\nChapter 3 begins with the land market.An extremely small proportion\n— only 1.2 per cent — of Papua New Guinea's land is used for\nagriculture, and three-quarters of that is planted to export tree\ncrops.Hence, even though the total land area per capita is quite high by\nglobal standards, the amount of land used for agriculture per farm\nworker is less than one-tenth that for the average developing\ncountry.One reason so little land is used stems from the land tenure\nsystem.Traditionally, customary land is owned by groups or clans, and\npeople born into a group automatically become co-owners. There are\nno titles to that land, however, so tenure is insecure and the right to\nbuy, improve and resell land is absent. This reduces the incentive for an\nindividual to make long-term investments in improving the productivity\nof the land, including the initial investment of clearing forest land for\nagricultural purposes.Progress toward issuing formal titles for land has\nprogressed extremely slowly, primarily because it is almost impossible\nto get the required consensus before land is alienated.Moreover, even\nthe 2 or 3 per cent of land that has a freehold or leasehold title cannot\nbe sold to non-nationals, and nationals do not value highly the certifi-\ncate of title because they fear conflict with other groups who may claim\ncustomary right to that land.Hence, there is a major divergence be-\ntween the private and social value of land, leading to gross\nunderutilization of, and underinvestment in land.In addition, without\nland titles as collateral, farmers have difficulty obtaining long-term\ncredit for investment in agriculture.Clearly the government needs to\nmake a much bigger investment in finding ways to improve the security",
    "Page_15": "Rural credit policy\nweakens the position of\nsmallholders\n\nHigh non-farm wages and\nthe shift to the towns\n\nEffects of market\ndistortions on agriculture\n\nImplications of government\ntrade restrictions\n— on food\n\nGROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nof customary land tenure and to speed up the process of issuing new\ntitles and transferring existing titles.\n\nThe market for financial capital is also grossly distorted, and in ways\nwhich probably reduce the resources available for agricultural produc-\ntion, especially smallholder production.The banks have tried to find\nways to reduce the uncertainty of lending to farmers in the absence of\nsecure land titles, though such attempts inevitably raise the cost of\nagricultural lending.Partly in response to this high cost of lending the\ngovernment has chosen to subsidize loans for farmers, especially via\nthe government's Agriculture Bank, and to require commercial banks to\noffer some additional agricultural loans at concessional rates of inter-\nest.The latter necessarily means that those banks have to charge\nhigher rates of interest to other borrowers and/or pay lower rates of\ninterest to depositors. This most probably has meant that fewer funds\nare available in aggregate for agricultural lending.|t certainly has meant\nthat the available concessional finance is allocated to the banks’ least\nrisky and least costly customers, who tend to be the large borrowers\nwith secure collateral.Thus agriculture as a whole — but especially the\nsmallholder subsector — is likely to be worse off, rather than better off,\nas a result of Papua New Guinea’s rural credit policy.\n\nThe distortions in the labour market also generate inefficiencies and\ninequities in resource use.The very high minimum urban wage in\nPapua New Guinea ensures that fewer people are employed in the\nnon-agricultural sectors than would be the case otherwise. This does\nnot necessarily mean that more people are employed in agriculture, or\nthat the rural wage level is lower than it would otherwise be.High urban\nwages attract rural people to the towns in search of jobs.There is a\nlimited number of urban jobs, and the consequent unemployment\nresults in less production in the economy, law-and-order problems in\nthe towns, and possibly even less labour and higher wage costs in the\nagricultural sector.These problems may be exacerbated if the non-\nagricultural sectors are protected from import competition or otherwise\nsubsidized.Moreover, as farmers expand their cash sales and their\npurchases of modem inputs they will be further disadvantaged by the\neffect of high non-farm wages on the price of purchased inputs and\nmarketing services.\n\nThe net effect of these distortionary policies in the markets for the\ncountry’s land, capital and labour resources is certainly to reduce\naggregate production and most probably to reduce agricultural produc-\ntion in particular.Without doubt a great deal more agricultural land\nwould become available, and all agricultural land would be utilized\nbetter, if more secure forms of land tenure could be implemented.Free-\ning up the finance and labour markets would also improve the\nefficiency with which the nation’s resources are used, and make for\ngreater equity.\n\nProduct markets, too, are distorted by government policies.While\nPapua New Guinea is not as interventionist as many developing\ncountries, there appears to be increasing use of trade restrictions as a",
    "Page_16": "OVERVIEW\n\n—and on non-agricultural\ngoods\n\nThe ‘hard kina strategy’\nand agriculture\n\nInadequacies of price\nstabilization schemes\n\nxvii\n\nmeans of encouraging or discouraging the production or consumption\nof selected goods.For example, imports of many food items are\nbanned, apparently to encourage the production of domestic sub-\nstitutes.Diverting agricultural resources from low cost to high cost\nactivities reduces the overall efficiency and growth of the agricultural\nsector, however, and raises the cost of purchasing food while reducing\nthe variety of nutrients available for consumption.Also, in the case of\nintensive livestock products which can be produced efficiently only by\nrelying on imported feedgrains, it does little to boost the country’s food\nself-sufficiency.\n\nImport restrictions also apply to many non-agricultural goods.While to\ndate these have not encouraged a large amount of manufacturing\nactivity, they have the potential to do so as cash incomes and hence\ndomestic demand expand.A more uniform set of import tariffs in place\nof the current wide diversity of tariff and non-tariff barriers would be\nless likely to encourage resources to move into high cost industries. At\nthe same time they would enhance the amount of government revenue\nraised by a given degree of trade restriction.An alternative and more\nradical policy change would be to replace import barriers by a uniform\nexport tax.The latter would be no more disadvantageous than the\nformer from the viewpoint of export industries, and it would have a\nnumber of advantages including lower costs of administering trade\nrestrictions and fewer opportunities for potential import-replacing\nproducer interest groups to seek favours from the government.\n\nThe other important policy which affects product prices, also discussed\nin Chapter 4, concerns the exchange rate.Insofar as Papua New\nGuinea's ‘hard kina strategy’ has artificially held up the value of the\nkina, it has raised the price of non-tradable goods and services relative\nto the price of tradables.It is true that the real depreciations allowed\nsince 1983 represent a slight change in government policy to allow\nmarket forces to play more of a role in the foreign exchange market\nthan had hitherto been the case.However, given the substantial\ndeterioration in the country’s terms of trade during the 1980s and the\neconomy's mounting foreign debt service obligations, further devalua-\ntion may be warranted. If such action were forthcoming, it would allow\nthe sectors producing tradable goods, not least agriculture, to make a\nmore substantial contribution to the economy's development.\n\nPapua New Guinea, like many primary exporting developing countries,\nfaces rather unstable external terms of trade.Fluctuations in export\neamings are commonly assumed to be bad for a developing economy\nbecause of their contribution to macroeconomic instability and be-\ncause they will induce producers to invest less in the export\nsector.Governments therefore conclude that price stabilization\nschemes are desirable for any major export commodity whose interna-\ntional price fluctuates markedly. Not surprisingly, Papua New Guinea\nhas implemented buffer fund arrangements for its major tree\ncrops.These schemes require levies from producers in high-price\nyears with the money being deposited in a fund to be drawn on in\nlow-price years when producers receive a supplement to the export",

The evidence\npresented suggests Papua New Guinea has been greatly underinvest-\ning in agricultural research.Further investment in this area is likely to\nprovide a very high (though not necessarily immediate) pay off in terms\nof expanded agricultural and national income.The evidence also sug-\ngests that the extent of underinvestment has varied widely between\ndifferent activities. Too little is going to research compared with exten-\nsion, and of the research expenditure too little is going to coffee,\ncoconuts and, to a slightly lesser extent, cocoa. This does not neces-\nsarily mean more goverment expenditure from consolidated revenue\nneeds to be spent on government research stations.Instead the\ngovernment might simply increase the export levies currently imposed\non producers and pass that money to existing or new producer-owned\nresearch and extension institutions.As for traditional staple food crops,\nthere appears to be little demand for research in this area by either\nsmallholder producers or consumers.Thus, given the extremely high\nreturns likely to flow from further research investment in export crops in\nwhich Papua New Guinea already has a strong comparative ad-\nvantage, the latter would appear to be the most appropriate way to\nsatisfy the government's objectives.\n\nThe more educated the farming population, the greater the benefits\nfrom new agricultural technologies. This is because new technologies\ntypically involve more complex management decisions and education\ntends to enhance decision-making capabilities.For this reason alone\nthe retums from investing more in rural education will increase as\nagricultural research expands.In addition, a better-educated rural\npopulation will provide more capable workers for the expanding\nProportion of jobs in the non-farm sectors of the economy.Thus, even\nthough a large proportion of the government’s budget is already\ndevoted to education, Chapter 7 shows that further investment in\nelementary education would yield a very high social retum.The same\ncannot be said for upper secondary and especially tertiary education,\nhowever, so the proportion of the resources currently devoted to these\nareas might be reduced somewhat during the next few years.In addi-\ntion to improving the efficiency of public investment in education, such\na reallocation would also reduce future income inequalities.\n\nIn the health area, too, Papua New Guinea is spending more per capita\nthan many other developing countries.Despite that, the standard of\nhealth is still low, although switching to a more nutritious diet would be\nsufficient to solve some of the problems.As with education, it would\nappear that a reallocation of current spending away from hospitals in\nthe larger towns and towards small scale health services in rural areas\n— and perhaps also to lower cost, church-run health services in the\ntowns — would result in both more efficient and more equitable access\nto health care.Not only would a better rural health service enhance the\nwelfare of rural people directly, but through boosting labour productivity",

Some of them must await an\nimprovement in the collection and publication of statistics on the\neconomy before they can be answered.But even with currently avail-\nable data there would be much to gain from further in-depth empirical\nanalysis of a number of issues that have had to be ignored or only\nbriefly touched on here. The final chapter identifies some priority areas:\nassessing altemative tax structures, booming sector analysis, land\ntenure alternatives and analysis of priorities in government expenditure\nand of sectoral taxation and assistance policies. Research into these\naspects of government policy and resource allocation would clearly\npromote a much more informed debate within the policy-making\nprocess.",

Since then, however, it has per-\nformed poorly both in absolute terms and relative to other economies.\nAgriculture in particular has not performed well especially in producing\nfood for local consumption. This chapter examines Papua New\nGuinea’s economic growth performance compared with other develop-\ning countries and discusses the structural changes that have occurred\nin the process of Papua New Guinea’s economic development. From\nthis examination a number of notable features emerge, explanations\nfor which are sought in subsequent chapters. The most significant\nfeature is the relatively slow growth of Papua New Guinea's economy\nin spite of massive mineral exploitation. Another is the speed of struc-\ntural change— typically something that is highly correlated with the\nrate of economic growth which — for Papua New Guinea, has been\nabove the average for developing countries. A third feature is that food\nproduction per capita in Papua New Guinea appears to have declined\nin absolute terms since the mid 1970s.\n\nEconomic growth\n\nThe economy of Papua New Guinea grew relatively rapidly in the\n1960s. Its real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual\naverage rate of 6.5 per cent, compared with 5.9 per cent for other\nmiddle income economies and 4.4 per cent for low income economies\nother than China and India. During that decade Papua New Guinea's\npopulation is estimated to have grown a little less rapidly than popula-\ntions in other developing countries, and hence real per capita GDP\ngrew substantially faster in Papua New Guinea than in other develop-\ning countries and even slightly faster than in industrial countries (Table\n1.1).\n\nHowever during the 1970s real per capita income stagnated in Papua New\nGuinea, and in the 1980s it even declined. While the global economy\ngenerally has grown much more slowly during the past fifteen years than in\nthe 1960s, in relative terms Papua New Guinea’s performance has been\npoor and contrasts markedly with neighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia\nwhich also enjoyed booms in export eamings in the 1970s. The only group\nof countries to have done worse than Papua New Guinea in the 1980s\n(though not in the 1970s) is sub-Saharan Africa (Table 1.2).",

The intermediate value of 2.3 per cent, used\n\nby Goodman et al. (1985), is adopted.\nSource: World Bank, World Development Report, New York, Oxford University Press, 1982 and 1988.\n\nEffect of departing\nexpatriates\n\nEffective changes in terms\nof trade\n\nTo some extent the poor performance from 1973-80 is simply a conse-\nquence of many high income expatriates leaving the country taking\ntheir savings and skills with them. However, the corollary of this has\nbeen that increasing proportions of export tree crop production, urban\ncommercial business activities and jobs in the bureaucracy previously\nowned or held by non-nationals are now in the hands of nationals and\ntheir real incomes have increased substantially. According to Garnaut\nand Baxter (1983:66) the increase in the share of market GDP accruing\nto nationals in the late 1970s is a reversal of the trend during the 1960s\nand early 1970s. This suggests that incomes of nationals grew less\nrapidly in the 1960s and early 1970s and more rapidly in the rest of the\n1970s than the aggregate data in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 suggest. How-\never, Garnaut and Baxter also note that, by the end of the 1970s,\nnationals’ share of production was stabilizing at a high level. Lack of\ngrowth in aggregate GDP per capita in the 1980s thus reflects a loss in\nreal income even for nationals.\n\nReal GDP growth rates in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 are estimated at constant\nprices. However, if a country’s terms of trade change over time the\npurchasing power of traded production also changes. A more accurate\nmeasure of the real value of production would adjust for the effects of\nchanges in the terms of trade. Papua New Guinea’s terms of trade\ndeteriorated markedly in the 1970s and 1980s whereas for other\ndeveloping countries, on average, the opposite occurred. Adjusting for\nthis fact shows Papua New Guinea to have done even worse since\n1973. Growth rates for real per capita GDP, after adjusting for the terms\nof trade change, are -2.3 per cent for 1973-80 and -1.5 per cent for\n1980-86 (for 1965-73 the growth rate remains 4.2 per cent), well below\nthe unadjusted rates shown in Table 1.2.",

In the 1960s, coffee and cocoa were the key sources of export\ngrowth. Then, from 1974, palm oil exports began to grow (Figure 1.1).\nHowever, the growth in agricultural exports was eclipsed during the\nperiod 1972-75 by the export of massive volumes of copper and gold\nfrom Bougainville (Figure 1.2). Exports did not expand much in the\nlatter half of the 1970s; indeed Papua New Guinea’s export growth\nperformance then was as poor as that of sub-Saharan Africa (see Table\n1.3). But in the 1980s exports of some commodities expanded again.\nBetween 1980 and 1984 the volumes of log and palm oil exports\ndoubled and quadrupled, respectively, and the volume of gold exported\nin 1985 and 1986 was twice that of earlier years. Given the much\ngreater export volume in the 1980s compared with the 1960s, one\nmight expect to have seen substantial investments in place that were\nable to provide permanently higher and growing incomes.\n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Coffee\nIndex of volumes of\nexports of selected crops,\nPapua New Guinea,\n1958-86 (million kina,\nvalued at 1980 export unit\nvalues)\n\nSource\nPapua New Guinea, National\nStatistical Office, Summary of\nStatistics and Abstract of Statistics,\nPort Moresby, various issues.\n\nca~\nena\n\n-—Copra and\ncoconut oil",

During the 1960s and 1970s, the country’s terms of trade\nfluctuated around a flat trend. However, between 1979 and 1982 they\ndeteriorated substantially and had recovered only a little by 1986. This\ncontrasts with the experience of other developing countries which, on\naverage, have enjoyed a substantial improvement in their terms of\ntrade since 1970. Even industrial economies — hit by rising energy\nimport prices in 1973-74 and 1979-80 — suffered only a modest\nworsening in their terms of trade compared with Papua New Guinea\n(Figure 1.3). The fluctuations in prices have varied considerably within\nthe export commodity group, however, with peaks and troughs for\nindividual commodities sometimes coinciding and sometimes offset-\nting each other (Figure 1.4). The net effect of changes in the country’s\nterms of trade can be seen in Table 1.4. Despite the deterioration in the\nterms of trade between 1965 and 1986, it was nonetheless possible in\n1986 to buy ten times as many imports as it was in 1965 or three times\nas many as in 1970, given the growth in export volume.\n\nIncreased indebtedness The declines in real incomes in Papua New Guinea since the mid\n\nsuggests excessive 1970s have not been matched by similar declines in consumption,\n\nconsumption resulting in increased indebtedness during the 1980s. The total over-\nseas debt outstanding in the latter half of the 1970s averaged about\none-quarter of GDP, but by the mid 1980s it averaged more than\nthree-quarters of GDP. The debt service ratio has worsened even\nmore, rising from around 4 per cent of exports in the 1970s to an\nestimated 50 per cent in 1986 (Figure 1.5). As it happens, only part of\nthe increased indebtedness is being channelled into investments. The\ngrowing consumption-driven part of the debt burden is thus postponing\nthe time when Papua New Guinea can phase down its dependence on\nforeign aid from Australia and elsewhere.",

In recent years, food has accounted for one-fifth of all\nPapua New Guinea’s merchandise imports, and the volume of food\nimports has been growing at about 4 per cent per annum since Inde-\npendence. According to data from the United Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization, between 1975 and 1986 food production\ngrew only 24 per cent in Papua New Guinea compared with 36 per cent\nin all developing countries. On a per capita basis this represents a 7\nper cent decline for Papua New Guinea compared with a rise of 5 per\ncent for all developing countries, 12 per cent for East Asian market\neconomies and a massive 35 per cent for Indonesia (Table 1.5). Papua\nNew Guinea has not done as badly in expanding its non-food agricul-\ntural production but even aggregate agricultural production has\ndeclined since Independence when expressed in per capita terms.’\n\nBefore turning to the structural changes that have accompanied Papua\nNew Guinea’s slow economic growth, it is worth noting that the\neconomic performance is reflected in a number of social development\nindicators (Table 1.6). As of 1985, life expectancy at birth was only 52\nyears, compared with more than 60 years in developing countries as a\ngroup — and despite no higher infant mortality than in other developing\ncountries. This is due partly to inadequacies in the health care system,\n\n1 There is considerable uncertainty associated with Papua New Guinea's population and subsistence food production estimates.\nHowever, a careful study by Shaw (1984) concludes that per capita food production may well be declining and at best it would be\nincreasing only very slowly. See also Goodman, Lepani and Morawetz (1985: Ch.4).",
    "Page_30": "ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE 11\n\nPre-1970s: a dual economy\nof subsistence agriculture\nand foreign, monetized\nenciaves\n\nSince 1960s: agriculture’s\nShare of GDP declining; fall\nin subsistence food\nproduction\n\none indicator being the very small number of physicians in the country,\nand also to the low calorie and protein intake in some regions. School\nenrolments are also much lower than in other developing countries\n(especially for females) and, on a per capita basis, Papua New Guinea\nstill ranks as one of the world’s most aid-dependent economies. While\nmost of these indicators represent a substantial improvement com-\npared with a decade or so ago, they suggest that health, education and\nfood intake are below the standards of other developing countries.\n\nStructural changes\n\nPrior to the 1970s Papua New Guinea was a dualistic economy. Close\nto 90 per cent of the population was involved in subsistence agriculture\nand was only just beginning to earn and use cash. The monetized part\nof the economy was closely linked with the Australian economy. A small\nenclave of large-scale plantations owned by foreign corporations or\nindividuals provided most of the export eamings, budgetary grants\nfrom Australia funded most government services, Australian currency\nwas used, and the majority of Papua New Guinea’s external trade was\nwith Australia. The average income per capita was in the mid-range for\ndeveloping countries, but about three-quarters of estimated gross\ndomestic product was spent by the small, affluent enclave. Thus it is\nnot surprising that Papua New Guinea was more agrarian in terms of\nemployment than other developing economies with the same average\nincome per capita. In the early 1960s only one in ten workers in Papua\nNew Guinea had jobs outside of agriculture, compared with one in\nthree for other middle income countries.\n\nPapua New Guinea in the 1960s was also more agrarian in terms of\nagriculture’s share of exports than other developing economies with\nsimilar levels of per capita income. Its relatively strong comparative\nadvantage in agriculture is explained by the low population density (16\nhectares per capita in 1970 compared with a global average of 3\nhectares), poorly developed labour skills and urban infrastructure for\nattracting foreign industrial capital, and the absence at that time of\nknown, commercially viable mineral deposits (see Anderson 1983).\n\nDespite the fact that per capita income has not grown much in Papua\nNew Guinea since the 1960s there have been quite marked structural\nchanges during the past two decades. The most obvious changes are\nthe decline in relative importance of agriculture as mining activities\nhave grown, increased dependence of the economy on foreign trade,\nand increasing monetization of rural activities. Agriculture’s share of\nGDP was more than 40 per cent in the 1960s, but it fell to around 30\nper cent in the mid 1970s. Exports of goods and services amounted to\nless than 20 per cent of GDP prior to the early 1970s but have\naccounted for about 45 per cent of GDP in recent years. Meanwhile,\nsubsistence food production has fallen from more than one-quarter to\nless than one-seventh of total GDP and from nearly two-thirds to less\nthan one-half of agricultural GDP.",

First, while the agricultural sector\nof an economy is expected to decline in relative importance with\neconomic growth at home and abroad, this decline is expected to be\nslower in slower growing economies. Yet in the slow growing economy\nof Papua New Guinea the agricultural sector’s relative importance in\nGDP has, if anything, declined faster than in other developing\ncountries (Table 1.7). Second, the rate of decline of agriculture, forestry\nand fishing’s share of exports has been dramatic in Papua New\nGuinea. Until the early 1970s more than 90 per cent of the country’s\nexports were from the primary sector (mainly agricultural) but, since\nthe mid 1970s, that share has been only half as large (Table 1.8). It is\ntrue that similar rates of decline have occurred in other resource-rich\ndeveloping countries, especially oil-exporting countries such as In-\ndonesia. But what is remarkable about Papua New Guinea's export\nstructure, compared with that of other middle income countries, is the\nextreme dominance of agriculture earlier and the continuing unimpor-\ntance of manufacturing.",

Meanwhile,\ntubber’s share of exports has fallen from around 8 per cent in the early\n1960s to less than 0.5 per cent today.\n\nMonetization of agriculture Another set of changes within the agricultural sector has been the\nincreasing monetization of the sector (see Fisk 1964). This has oc-\ncurred with respect to both outputs and inputs. On the output side,\nvillagers have shown a clear tendency to market an increasing propor-\ntion of their output for cash. They have devoted a larger share of their\nproductive resources to cash-earning exotic enterprises (for example,\nexport tree crops and broiler production) rather than expanding their\nmarketabie surplus of traditional staple foods. There is also a sig-\nnificant production and consumption of betel nut for cash. Shaw (1984)\nestimates urban and rural sales of betel nut in the early 1980s to have\nbeen of the order of K15-20 million. In the 1960s little more than\none-third of the assessed value of agricultural output (including forestry\nand fishing) was marketed for cash, whereas by 1980 that share had\ngrown to about 60 per cent. In terms of total GDP the value of non-\nmarketed agricultural production declined from 26 per cent in the late\n1960s to 14 per cent in the late 1970s. This is reflected in the share of\nsubsistence food production in total private consumption which fell\nfrom 46 per cent in the early 1960s to 26 per cent in the late 1970s\n(Table 1.10). It is also reflected in the increasing proportion of export\ncrop production being supplied by indigenous smallholders (Table\n1.11).",
    "Page_34": "ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE 15\n\nAgriculture still the major\nemployer in PNG economy\n\nAgricultural productivity\nimproving but only slowly\n\nNeed to explain slow\ngrowth, rapid structural\nchange and decline in food\nand agricultural\nproductivity\n\nAn important consequence of the structural change from subsis-\ntence to cash cropping is that a growing share of agricultural output is\nbecoming susceptible to domestic and international market forces, and\nhence also to market interventions by government.\n\nDespite the development of mineral production and exports, Papua\nNew Guinea’s economy is still more agrarian than the average low\nincome economy in terms of employment. As much as three-quarters\nof the workforce is still engaged in agriculture compared with little more\nthan one-half in the average lower middle income economy. And\nwhereas the service sector employs about one in three workers in\ndeveloping countries as a whole, it employs less than one in seven of\nPapua New Guinea’s workers (Table 1.12).\n\nIn addition to agriculture’s share of employment in Papua New Guinea\nbeing comparatively large, the rate of decline of that share has been\nrelatively slow. This contrasts with the above average rate of decline in\nagriculture’s share of GDP and suggests that labour productivity in\nagriculture relative to other sectors has not been growing as rapidly in\nPapua New Guinea as in other developing countries. Both land and\nlabour productivity in agriculture have been improving in absolute\nterms in Papua New Guinea, but not nearly as fast as has been\noccurring in the agricultural sectors of neighbouring developing\ncountries. Agricultural output per agricultural worker and per hectare in\n1985 was 30 and 40 per cent above that of 1970 for Papua New\nGuinea while for Indonesia and Malaysia it was between 70 and 85 per\ncent higher (Table 1.13).\n\nFeatures to be explained\n\nThis brief comparative overview of growth and structural change in\nPapua New Guinea’s economy raises a number of questions. They\ninclude the following:\n\na Whyisitthat, despite the mining boom, the average income in Papua\nNew Guinea has not grown, in sharp contrast to countries such as\nneighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia?\n\na Why has the speed of structural change in this slow growing\neconomy been above the developing country average?\n\na In particular, why has food and agricultural production per capita\ndeclined?\n\nThe last question is especially important because what happens to\nthe agricultural sector is going to affect the welfare of the vast majority\nof the population, given the continuing dominance of agriculture as an\nemployer and as the main source of staple food. The agricultural sector\nis not separate from the rest of the economy, however. On the contrary,\nwhat happens in the product and factor markets of other sectors will\nsoon feed back to the agricultural sector, and vice versa. Even the\nsubsistence sector producing perishable (non-tradable) products is\naffected by changes in the market for tradable goods.

    "Page_37": "2 Reasons for the structural changes\n\n \n\nThe previous chapter identified a number of unusual features of the\nstructural changes that have taken place in the course of Papua New\nGuinea’s economic development. This chapter seeks to explain the\nmore important of these. It begins by examining why agriculture typical-\nly declines in a growing economy. It then examines one set of reasons\nwhy agriculture did not decline at a slower rate in Papua New Guinea\nthan in other developing countries, despite the country’s slow economic\ngrowth, and why food production grew so slowly.\n\nWhy agriculture declines relatively as an economy grows’\n\nA helpful model of a It is clear from Table 1.7 that agriculture declines in relative importance\ntwo-sector, closed as an economy grows. To understand why this happens it is simplest to\neconomy proceed in stages. Consider first a closed economy with only two\n\nsectors, agriculture and non-agriculture. If productivity growth is occur-\nring equally rapidly in both sectors, supply curves would shift out at the\nsame rate, as in Figure 2.1. Here we assume the two supply curves\ncoincide initially, and hence they also coincide subsequent to the\nproductivity growth. But because people typically spend a declining\nproportion of their income on food as their incomes increase, demand\ngrows less for agricultural products than for other goods. Thus the\ndemand curves are shown in Figure 2.1 to shift to the right at different\nrates in the two sectors. The net result of these two sets of changes is\nas follows: output of both sectors rises, but less so for agriculture, and\nthe price of agricultural products falls relative to the price of non-\nagricultural products. Hence the share of agriculture in aggregate\nnational product falls.\n\nIn the illustrated example, agriculture initially contributed (100 x 100\n=) 10,000 units to GDP, as did the non-agricultural sector, so that\nagriculture’s share of GDP was 50 per cent. After the equi-proportional\nproductivity growth has taken place in the two sectors, the increase in\nthe quantities supplied would be the same if prices for the two sets of\ngoods remained unchanged. However the growth in incomes that\nresults from this productivity growth leads to the demand for agricul-\ntural goods shifting less than that for non-agricultural goods.\nEquilibrium in the two markets requires that agricultural output ex-\npands only 80 per cent and non-agricultural output 120 per cent, and\nthat the price of agricultural goods falls to 85 while that of non-agricul-\ntural goods rises to 115 in the case illustrated. Thus agriculture’s share\n\n1 This section draws heavily on Johnson (1973: Ch.4) and Anderson (1987), where the arguments are laid out more fully.",

That is, it suggests that\ninternational prices for agricultural products relative to non-agricultural\nproducts, are likely to decline over time as the world economy grows.\nThis is indeed what has happened, as can be seen from Figure 2.2.2\n\nBut what about the situation of a small open economy such as Papua\nNew Guinea’s, which faces external terms of trade that are determined\nfrom outside? If the terms of trade for agriculture are declining over\ntime — as they have been, according to Figures 1.1 and 2.2 — then\neven if there is no economic expansion in Papua New Guinea the\nshare of agriculture in GDP, measured at international prices, will be\ndeclining. The same will be true even if the agricultural sector is\nexpanding, so long as its rate of expansion is not sufficiently faster than\nthe non-agricultural sector to offset the decline in relative agricultural\nprices.?\n\nThe above model assumes all products are tradable internationally. In\nreality, however, a large part of each economy involves the production\nand consumption of non-tradable goods and services.

The conclusion that agriculture’s\nshare of GDP is likely to decline over time is even stronger if it can be\ndemonstrated that the share of tradables in GDP is also likely to\ndecline in growing economies.\n\nAvailable evidence suggests that the income elasticity of demand for\nservices (which make up the vast majority of non-tradables) is well\nabove unity in developing countries and tends to converge toward unity\nas incomes grow (Lluch, Powell and Williams 1977; Kravis, Heston and\nSummers 1983; Summers 1985; Theil and Clements 1987). That is, for\ndeveloping countries any increase in income leads to a more than\nproportionate increase in the demand for services, which in turn means\nthe demand for tradable goods grows less than proportionately. So, if\nproductivity growth is equally rapidfor non-tradables and tradables, but\ndemand for non-tradables expands more rapidly than productivity —\nwhile demand for tradables expands less rapidly than productivity —\nthe price and quantity of non-tradables relative to tradables will both\nincrease. In that case the share of tradables in GDP will decline. Since\nwe have already demonstrated that within the tradables sector it is\nlikely that agriculture’s share of production will decline, it now seems\neven more likely that agriculture’s share of total GDP (tradables plus\nnon-tradables) will decline over time. For that not to happen in a small\nopen economy, agricultural productivity growth has to be substantially\ngreater than productivity growth not only in the non-agricultural\ntradables sector but also in the non-tradables sector, so as to offset the\ndecline in the relative price of agricultural goods.",
    "Page_40": "REASONS FOR THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES 21\n\nTradable substitutes for\nindigenous food keeps\ndown its price\n\nA qualification may be considered necessary for Papua New Guinea,\nhowever, because many of the foods produced by subsistence agricul-\nture are perishable and hence cannot be traded internationally. In fact,\nthough, these foods face competition in urban markets from substitute\nfoods which are tradable. Examples include canned or dried fruits and\nvegetables as substitutes for the fresh product, and rice or other grains\nas substitutes for sweet potato. Hence, if the prices of the perishable\nindigenous foods were to rise, the quantity of them demanded would\nfall greatly in the presence of competition from tradable substitutes,\nother things being equal. Thus their prices move closely in line with\nthose of tradable substitutes, rather than independently of them.\n\nTherefore it is not surprising that agriculture’s share of GDP has\ndeclined in Papua New Guinea during the past fifteen years, despite\nthe slow growth in GDP. But why did agriculture’s share decline even\nfaster than in other developing countries, to the point that food produc-\ntion per capita has actually fallen?\n\nWhy Papua New Guinea’s staple food sector has performed poorly\n\nBig increase and then\nfluctuations in Papua New\nGuinea's export prices and\nearnings\n\nDuring the past three decades there have been periods when Papua\nNew Guinea’s export sectors have been booming because of growth in\ntheir output and/or increases in the prices of their products. For ex-\nample, the value of Papua New Guinea’s exports in terms of its imports\nmore than trebled between 1970 and 1974, primarily because of export\nvolume growth. That value then dropped for two years when export\nprices declined, but recovered during 1977-80 before slumping again\nin the 1980s as export prices fell once more (Table 1.4). The changes\nin export earnings are reflected in changes in the effective exchange\nrate, althcugh the decline in the latter was arrested by an increase in\nnet overseas borrowings between 1981 and 1984 (Table 2.1).\n\nThe reason a boom in export earnings or other inflows of foreign\nfunds boosts the real value of a country’s currency and affects other\nsectors is as follows. As explained in Box 2.1, the greater availability of\nforeign currency means individual exporters and/or the government\ncan spend more. Insofar as some of that spending is on non-tradable\nproducts, their price will rise relative to that for tradables (a real\nexchange rate appreciation). As a result resources will move from the\ntradables sector to non-tradables. That is, the agricultural sector is\ndestined to grow less rapidly than it otherwise would while there is a\nboom in mineral exports.",

Between 1980 and 1982 the price of copper and gold in US\ndollar terms fell by one-third, and fell further in the mid 1980s after a\nslight recovery in 1983. This decline was even steeper in terms of the\nyen or deutschmark. The volume of copper ore and concentrate ex-\nported from Papua New Guinea also declined after 1982-83 (Figure\n1.2). Thus the real exchange rate has been under pressure to decline\nthrough the 1980s. The decline was delayed by the massive growth in\noverseas borrowings between 1980 and 1984 — in part to finance\nconstruction at the Ok Tedi mining site in the early 1980s. But between\n1984 and 1986 the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 16 per\ncent (Table 2.1). A consequence of the depreciation was that other\ntradable sectors became more competitive. This, together with\ndevelopments in international commodity markets, is reflected in the\nincreases in kina prices of agricultural export products from 1981. As is\nevident from Table 2.2, only part of these increases is due to changes\nin the US dollar prices in international commodity markets; the rest is\ndue to the US dollar-kina exchange rate depreciation. Those kina price\nincreases stimulated agricultural exports in the mid 1980s: as shown in\nFigure 1.2, the volume of agricultural exports increased 27 per cent\nbetween 1982 and 1986.\n\nIt is clear that developments in one sector of the economy can rapidly\naffect other sectors. The agricultural sector in Papua New Guinea — as\nin all countries — is continually under pressure to decline in relative\nimportance because the relative demand for agricultural products\ntends to expand less rapidly than their relative supply. Moreover, in\nPapua New Guinea the agricultural sector was under additional pres-\nsure to decline in the 1970s because of the inter-sectoral effects of the\nmining boom. The latter pressure reversed in the mid 1980s, which\nencouraged some growth in agricultural exports. But if the prospective\nmining developments for the next decade come to fruition, the value of\nPapua New Guinea’s mineral exports could multiply several times in\nthe 1990s (Table 2.3), putting even more competitive pressure on the\nagricultural sector.\n\nWhile these phenomena go some way towards explaining why the\nagricultural sector has declined in relative importance in Papua New\nGuinea, the following question remains. Why have investments from the\nincreased income associated with long-term expansion in export",

Neighbouring Indonesia experienced a similar\n(though proportionately larger) export boom in the 1970s — and a\nsimilar slump after the early 1980s — which also resulted in a major\ndecline in the relative importance of its agricultural sector (Table 1.7),\nand for similar reasons (Warr 1985). However, Indonesia invested\nmuch of its expanded petroleum revenue in agricultural development\nand also reduced many of the disincentives which government policies\nhad previously imposed on farmers. As a result, even though\nIndonesia’s agricultural sector has declined in relative importance, its\nfood and agricultural production per capita has expanded enormously\n\n(Table 1.5).*\nFailure of mineral profits to Perhaps part of the reason for the low income growth is that the\ngrow mineral profits available to be taxed have not been large except in a\n\nfew years. The ore grade for Bougainville Copper Ltd has steadily\ndeclined during the past 15 years, and the company’s fuel and labour\ncosts have risen substantially. As a result the operating cost per unit of\ncopper concentrate trebled during the first decade of commercial\nproduction. The export price for concentrate has not kept pace with the\nincreases in mining costs, and so Bougainville Copper’s earnings\nbefore taxation have been modest except in 1973-74, 1978-80 and\n1987 (Table 2.4).\n\n4 In contrast to Indonesia, Nigeria has adjusted rather poorly to its oil boom and recent slump; see, for example, Pinto (1987).

In the case of agricultural\nland there is a problem of too little efficient government intervention,\nwhile for the financial capital and labour markets the problem is too\nmuch, or the wrong kind, of intervention. The overall effect of govern-\nment policies is to reduce incentives to retain and improve resources in\nagriculture, including subsistence/smallholder farming.\n\nAgricultural land\n\nPapua New Guinea is abundantly endowed with land relative to\npopulation. In 1985 it had 11 hectares per capita, or more than four\ntimes the average for developing countries. Its use of that land shows\na very different pattern from that in other countries, however. While\nPapua New Guinea has more than three times as many hectares per\ncapita planted to permanent crops as the average developing country,\nand six times as many hectares still in forest form (columns 3 and 5 of\nTable 3.1), it has only a small area — representing less than 0.3 per\ncent of its total land area — that is regularly used for annual crops or\nanimal grazing. On a per capita basis, the area used for these latter\npurposes is less than one-twentieth that of other developing countries\n(columns 1 and 2). Thus agricultural land (excluding forests) per farm\nworker is less than one-tenth that of other developing countries, and\nhas been declining over time (column 7).

This principle provides the person who\nfirst cleared and used a piece of land with rights over that property, and\nthose rights are shared with, and inherited by, that person’s descen-\ndants (Giddings 1981). Feder and Noronha (1987) refer to a similar\nprinciple in land tenure systems in sub-Saharan Africa: the person who\nfirst cleared the land, referred to as Maitre Du Feu (the Master of Fire),\nwas regarded as the original proprietor and his rights to the use of the\nland were transferred to his descendants. In both Papua New Guinea\nand Africa the use of fire as a land clearing mechanism is a common\ntechnology. In the African case, if there were no direct lineages from\nthe original proprietor, permission to use the land was obtained from\nthe chief and the rights to use continued as long as the farmer con-\ntinued to live in the village and recognized the jurisdiction of the chief.\nThe residence requirement in Papua New Guinea is similar. With\nprolonged migration away from the village there is a fear that the rights\nto land may become eroded, so individuals typically wish to return to\ntheir plais from time to time in order to preserve such rights.\n\nCustomary ownership of | Where land has been relatively abundant, the slash-and-burn technol-\nland areas ogy of shifting cultivation meant that access to land was usually not\ndifficult and was usually acquired through groups. Such group activity,\noften on a clan or kinship basis, led to a system of customary owner-\nship of land within which individuals acquired hunting and cultivation\nrights to particular pieces of land. However, where land was not as\nabundant and where customary ownership prevailed, there have been,\nand still are in the Highlands, disputes between clans over the owner-\n\nship of land.\nLegal recognition of During the period when Papua New Guinea was an Australian Trust\ncustomary rights Territory, a number of existing attitudes towards land ownership, use\n\nintroduced and transfer were reinforced by the Administration in various pieces of\n\nland legislation. The Australian Administration before Independence",
    "Page_52": "FACTOR MARKET DISTORTIONS\n\nTransfer of land titles more\ndiffcult in Papua New\nGuinea\n\n33\n\nwas acutely aware of the importance of land to the Papua New\nGuineans, so the legislation was aimed at giving legal recognition to\nthat fact and protecting customary land rights. In particular, the Ad-\nministration took the view that all unalienated land was regarded as\nbeing in customary ownership until it was clearly established, following\nthe procedures laid down in the legislation, that the land was unoc-\ncupied and unclaimed.\n\nThe principal pieces of legislation passed during the period before\nIndependence included the Land Ordinance 1962-1969, the Land Tit-\nles Commission Ordinance 1962-1968, the Land (Tenure Conversion)\nOrdinance 1963-1967, Lands Registration (Communally Owned Land)\nOrdinance 1962, and the New Guinea Land Titles Restoration Or-\ndinance 1951-1968. The specific purposes of these various land\nlegislation decisions were to:\n\na determine the ownership of land held on a group basis;\na register such communal rights;\n\no provide for the conversion of tenure from customary ownership to\nindividually registered titles;\n\nrestrict dealings in customary land;\n\nacquire compulsorily land for public purposes and for particular\ndevelopment purposes; and\n\na establish an independent judicial tribunal to determine and protect\nthe rights to land.\n\nSince Independence many of these pieces of legislation have\nremained in force. Morris (1981:9) refers to the Land Act 1962\nprovision that ‘a native has no power to sell, lease or dispose of native\nland otherwise than to natives in accordance with native custom’. The\nconsequences of the legislation are such that the transfer of title to\ncustomary land is difficult.\"\n\nLand ownership and transfer rights provided by the colonial powers in\nAfrica were not dissimilar (Feder and Noronha 1987). The major\ncolonial powers — the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Portugal\n— were of a similar view to the Australian Administration that all\noccupied land was held in communal tenure. This meant that in-\ndividuals had only user rights to land without the power to sell or\nmortgage it. Moreover, the existence of a tribal system with hereditary\nchiefs provided a convenient vehicle for the colonial powers to make\nthe chiefs, in effect, trustees for existing and future generations. Papua\nNew Guinea does not have a system of hereditary chiefs so far as the\ntribal or clan groupings are concerned, so the use of tribal chiefs as\ntrustees — which might simplify land use and transfer — is not avail-\nable in Papua New Guinea. Instead agreement has to be reached\nmore by consensus than by fiat.\n\n1 Relatively little land has been alienated in Papua New Guinea. Morris (1981) suggests that one per cent of all available land has been\nalienated as freehold land, mainly in the plantation sector. Land which has been alienated by the State under leasehold terms (ranging\nup to 99 years) accounts for about another two per cent of the total. About 10 per cent of arable area is alienated land held by\nGovernment, of which about 60 per centis not in productive use. Thus customary land still accounts for the vast majority of available\n\nland in Papua New Guinea.",
    "Page_53": "34\n\nAttempts at reform of land\npolicy based on several\nprinciples\n\nGROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nThere is considerable variation in the precise nature of customary\nownership of land in Papua New Guinea, but generally the proprietary\ninterest rests with a land holding group, and individuals within that\ngroup have limited rights of use for varying periods. Usually rights of\nownership to land use are acquired by birth into such a land holding\ngroup, and acquisition of such rights is not contingent on the death of a\ngroup member.\n\nEconomic pressures for change\n\nThe traditional forms of transfer and inheritance of customary land,\nwhile they provide everyone with ‘some land, employment, means of\nsupport, and security’ (Eaton 1981:15), are coming under increasing\nPressure. The cost of not having secure mechanisms for smoothly\nacquiring and transferring land ownership and use is increasing with\nthe growth in rural populations, the development of cash (especially\nperennial) cropping, the availability of new technologies, the change in\nthe value of land due to infrastructural developments such as.new\nroads, and the newly emerging preference of some individuals to see\ntheir own children succeed them as owners of land which they have\ndeveloped.\n\nThe Australian Administration in its Report of 1969-70 was aware\nthat customary land tenure is not satisfactory for economic progress\nbecause of its frequent lack of flexibility needed to encourage land\ndevelopment. A system which gives clear and transferable title to land\nis likely to provide greater incentives for progress (1971:83).\n\nIn an attempt to remove some of the rigidities in land acquisition,\ntransfer and use in Papua New Guinea, the Administration set up a\nnumber of principles as the basis for land policy. These were:\n\na the long-term objective of introducing a single system of land holding\nregulated by statute and providing for secure individual registered\ntitles;\n\no the government working through the relevant departments having the\nsole authority to issue and register land titles;\n\no land subject to native custom remaining subject to native custom until\nit is taken out of such custom by acquisition or by a process of tenure\nconversion to an individual registered title;\n\nany acquisition to be accompanied by compensation;\nland held under native custom not to be acquired outside native\ncustom except by the Administration;\n\no land to be acquired by the Administration only if the indigenous\nowners are willing to sell and in the opinion of the Administration the\nland is not required by them;\n\no conversion of title to occur only if those who have an interest in the\nland under native custom consent to conversion; and\n\na the services of Land Titles Commissioners to be used to investigate\nownership of land held under native custom which was proposed to\nbe acquired, to settle disputes about land ownership held under",

For example, there are\ncomplex arrangements which allow one community or individual tem-\nporary or seasonal use of another community’s land. According to\nKnetsch and Trebilcock (1981:41):\n\nPart of the explanation for the growth in non-customary, direct\ndealings (of dubious legality) in customary land appears to be a\nchronic inability on the part of the Department of Lands to develop\nflexible and expeditious procedures to govern the intermediation\nrole assigned to the central government by the existing provisions\nof the Lands Act.\n\nFeder and Noronha (1987) show that this informal market develop-\nment is precisely what one would expect, but that it is far from an\noptimal outcome because, without legal title, the land price or rent is\ndiscounted for risk so that there is a divergence between the social and\nmarket values for land. In addition, as discussed in the next section,\nthe less enforceable a land ownership or rental contract the less\nvaluable it is as collateral for the purposes of obtaining credit.\n\nFreehold and leasehold land transfer in Papua New Guinea also con-\nfronts institutional rigidities. For example, there is a constitutional\nprohibition on the acquisition of freehold land by non-nationals. This\ndiminishes its value as collateral to any lending institution, as does the\nfact that acquisition by nationals may be inhibited by social pressures\nwhere the nationals who acquire the land may come into conflict with\nother land groupings.\n\nThe prime example of restrictions on leasehold land is the decree by\nthe National Executive Council in 1974 that the leasehold interest in\nplantation properties could no longer be transferred to non-nationals.\nThe legislation, which was enacted as the Plantation Redistribution\nScheme, was aimed at increasing participation by Papua New\nGuineans in ownership of large plantations. The intention was that any\nplantations which were compulsorily acquired were to be reallocated to\nthe descendants of the customary land owners. While there were some\nexemptions, the major tree crop industries of copra, cocoa and coffee\nwere covered by the legislation. There is little doubt that the Plantation\nRedistribution Scheme seriously inhibited improvements in productivity\nin the plantation sector. In addition, leasehold land transfer is slowed\ndown by the requirement that it be subjected to detailed step-by-step\nministerial approval. This delay adds substantially to the cost of trans-\nferring a lease. Goldthorpe (1985) mentions the existence of some 200\nderelict estates abandoned by their owners, and suggests that the lost",

The small fraction of\nagricultural land that is freehold or leasehold cannot be sold to non-na-\ntionals, and nationals are inhibited in purchasing such titles for fear of\nconflict with other groups who may claim customary right to that land.\nIn any case, such transfers are subject to inordinate bureaucratic\ndelays, so the effective saleable value of the land is driven close to\nzero. This provides little incentive for existing or prospective owners to\ninvest in land, especially in long-term ventures such as replanting\nperennial tree crops. Similarly, long-term investments in improving the\nproductivity of customary land are discouraged by the absence of\nsecure tenure and of the right to sell improved land for capital gain.2\n\nEven the initial investment of clearing forest land is discouraged by\nthis system, which helps explain why so little has been permanently\ncleared to date.\n\nThe greater the profitability of land use, the more incentive there would\nbe both to find alternative methods of land use transfer and to expedite\nthe process of issuing formal titles to land. Subsequent chapters dis-\ncuss some of the reasons for the low profitability of agriculture in\nPapua New Guinea and hence the low intensity of pressure for reform\nin the land tenure system. The rest of this chapter is concerned with the\nprices of the other key factors of production, namely financial capital\nand labour, which are also reasons for the low profitability of agricul-\nture.\n\nFinancial capital\n\nSince few farmers in either advanced or developing economies are\nable to fund the whole of the capital formation on their farms through\ninternal savings, they have to make use of a financial intermediary. The\ncollateral typically provided as security for the loan is their land. How-\never, a prerequisite of any such development is a clear certificate of\ntitle of land ownership. If this is lacking then the financial institutions will\nbe less willing to advance credit and/or will require a risk premium in\nterms of a higher interest rate. With less credit available, or credit\navailable only at higher interest rates, farm investment will be less, and\nproductivity growth curtailed. Thus, increases in farm productivity will\nbe less likely to occur in Papua New Guinea where land titles are\ntypically not available. This critical inter-connection between secure\nland tenure and the credit market is illustrated in Figure 3.1\n\nThe Agriculture Bank of Papua New Guinea and the Papua New\nGuinea Banking Corporation both have been innovative in attempting\nto overcome the difficulties associated with uncertainties surrounding\nland titles. For many of its early loans the Agriculture Bank was\nprepared to accept as security an unsupported guarantee from people\n\n2 For amore detailed discussion of the effects of land tenure on agricultural productivity, see Feder and Naronha (1987) and Feder et\n\nal.

Such a guarantee required an assessment as to the\ncapacity of the guarantors to meet the guarantee should it be neces-\nsary. In its early days the Bank relied heavily for this on the extension\nofficer (didiman) from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock.\nThis often required the detailed preparation of the project by the\ndidiman who then became a de facto loans officer for the Bank. At the\nsame time the didiman took on the responsibility to see that the loans\nwere repaid on time and it is arguable that such a role was counter to\nthe objectives of the didiman as a tural extension officer. Now the\nAgriculture Bank is developing its own trained extension staff to super-\nvise lending and repayment, but the use of such specialist skills will\nnecessarily add to the cost of lending since previously neither the\ndidiman nor his employer was charging the Bank for his services.\n\nThe criteria used by the Agriculture Bank in assessing loan re-\nquests related to the size of the project relative to the potential\nborrower's management abilities, the cash flow from the project which\nmight then service the loan, and the equity contributed by the borrower.\nIn many cases, since cash equity was not available, the Bank insisted\non what became known as ‘sweat equity’ where through his own labour\nthe potential borrower had already developed the property to a certain\nextent.\n\nIn lending for the development of land held under customary title the\nAgriculture Bank devised the Clan Land Usage Agreement.

The Papua New\nGuinea Banking Corporation makes use of a similar agreement in its\nlending policy. Under an agreement with the Banking Corporation there\nis a statement that the rights to use are granted under tribal law and\ncustom and the land is charged in favour of the Banking Corporation\nwhile there is an outstanding debt on it. There is also provision for a\nprovincial government officer to certify that the Land Usage Agreement\nis compatible with tribal law and custom, and for recording the use in\nprovincial land use records. Under the agreement, the Bank secures\nrepayment by having a number of clan leaders who not only guarantee\nthe loan but also accept that, if default occurs, no further loans would\nbe made to the clan.\n\nThe Clan Land Usage Agreements have been widely used in the\ndevelopment of nuclear estates with respect to coffee and cocoa. In\nsuch circumstances, the lack of secure title may be offset to some\nextent by the use of management agencies, both public and private, to\nensure that the commitments which are entered into under the loan are\nmet. The management agencies participate directly in the control and\nmanagement of the operation of the project and may be responsible for\nthe operation of the estate’s bank account.\n\nIn a further attempt to overcome the uncertainties surrounding the lack\nof secure title to land, the Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation and\nthe government introduced in 1977 a Credit Guarantee Loan Scheme.\nThe scheme now encompasses not only the Banking Corporation but\nall commercial banks in Papua New Guinea. The guarantee by the\ngovernment is for 80 per cent of the debt outstanding at any one time,\nand there is an element of subsidy by the government as well. The\nscheme is restricted to citizens and to corporations which are\npredominantly owned and managed by nationals and which are first-\ntime borrowers. The maximum loans are K10,000 for individuals and\nK50,000 for companies. The scheme has been successful to the extent\nthat some 120 otherwise ineligible enterprises have been able to\nborrow K2.3 million since the scheme was introduced. The limited size\nof the scheme, however, has meant that its effectiveness in overcom-\ning the rigidities surrounding land rights in Papua New Guinea has\nbeen only minor.\n\nWhile these innovations by financial institutions have gone some\nway toward reducing the inefficiencies associated with the absence of\nsecure land tenure arrangements, they introduce another inefficiency\ninsofar as they have an element of subsidy in the provision of credit.\nBoth the early scheme of the Agriculture Bank, which involved unpaid\nuse of the Department of Agriculture’s didiman, and the more recent\nCredit Guarantee Loan Scheme, which involves explicit government\nsubsidies, are ensuring that farmers face private prices for credit that\nare lower than prices the country as a whole faces when borrowing on\nthe international capital market.\n\nIn addition, the government also pressures banks to provide loans to\nagriculture at concessional rates, even when little or no collateral is\nprovided.

The extent of the\nconcessions is indicated by the fact that in 1981 the Agriculture Bank’s\nloans to agriculture were provided at interest rates ranging from 5 to 11\nper cent (Table 3.2), when the weighted average interest rate charged\nby commercial banks was 15.6 per cent. The degree of subsidization is\neven larger than these interest rate differentials suggest, however,\nbecause the much higher cost of establishing and administering rural,\nas distinct from urban, loans is met largely by the bank rather than by\nthe customer?\n\nAre agricultural credit subsidies a ‘good thing’? The conventional wis-\ndom has been that farmers, especially small farmers, deserve\nagricultural credit subsidies. The argument is typically expressed in\nterms of both efficiency and equity objectives. The efficiency argument\nis often that the free market would provide too little credit for agriculture\nbecause of the risky nature of the long-term investments involved,\nand/or that usurious interest rates are charged in those markets where\nthere is only one lender in the vicinity. The equity argument is simply\nthat because many farmers are small they are therefore poor, and\ncheap credit is one way in which they can be subsidized to produce\ntheir way out of poverty.\n\nNeither argument stands up to close scrutiny, however. If agricultural\ninvestment is more risky than other types of investment and society is\nrisk averse, then it is socially optimal to invest less in agriculture than if\nit were characterized by the same degree of risk as other enterprises.\nThere is therefore no market failure to be overcome here. Nor is there\nmarket failure with respect to the monopoly provision of loans in a\nvillage so long as there are no barriers to entry by other potential\nlenders. The fact is that many rural settings are too small in aggregate\nto attract more than one lender. Hence that lender has a natural, not a\n\n3 One loan officer suggested that, on average, at least a further 10 percentage points should be added to the interest rate for agricultural\nas compared with urban loans to cover the higher cost of lending in rural areas. Thus, since virtually no commercial bank loans are\nat interest rates above 17 per cent, and the average non-rural loan is at a rate of about 15 per cent, loans to agriculture must involve\navery considerable concession (in real terms, including transaction costs).",

Even though he may enjoy high profits, they are\nnot high enough to attract a second lender and so are still the lowest\none can expect. If a second lender did enter such a naturally monopo-\nlized market, by definition one or both would make losses unless\nsubsidized. The interest rates charged in such isolated markets attract\nattention because of their large absolute size, particularly for small\nloans. But when the transaction costs are properly accounted for, it\nusually turns out that the net rate of interest received by the lender is\nclose to the market rate. That is, the rates are not usurious at all.\n\nThe equity argument, that a cheap credit policy for small (or, in Papua\nNew Guinea's case, indigenous) farmers helps the poor to participate\nin the development process, also has little merit. Credit is like any other\ngood in that the lower the interest rate, the larger the quantity\ndemanded. If a bank is forced by the government to provide some\nloans at concessional rates to a target group, the bank would be\nrational to limit the funds available for such purposes — since. they\nneed to be cross-subsidized by other customers — and to provide\nthose loans to their least costly customers in the (often loosely defined)\ntarget group. Normally this means a small number of large loans will be\nmade, rather than a large number of small loans, to reduce transac-\ntions (including risk) costs. That is, the concessions will tend to be\nenjoyed by the largest farmers in the target group. To cover the cost of\nthis concessional lending, depositors will receive less interest and/or\nother borrowers will have to pay higher interest rates. And the latter\ngroup will include all the smaller farmers who were unable to obtain a\nconcessional loan: for them the subsidy scheme has had the effect of\nraising, rather than lowering, interest rates. * Even if the government\nused its scarce resources to subsidize the banks permanently in a bid\nto avoid this division into eligible receivers and less eligible non-\nreceivers of the concessional loans, the likely outcome is that more\nlarge loans would be provided to the eligibles (larger farmers) without\nmany of the less eligibles necessarily graduating to become eligibles.\n\nWhat evidence is there in Papua New Guinea for such behaviour by\nlending institutions? The two institutions making significant loans to the\nagricultural sector are the commercial banks and the Agriculture Bank.\nTogether they account for about 90 per cent of all lending. The Agricul-\nture Bank is subsidized directly in the sense that the government\npasses on the low-interest loans it receives from international conces-\nsional lending institutions such as the World Bank. In addition, the\nAgriculture Bank receives direct capital grants from the government on\nwhich it pays no dividend. By 1984 these grants had accumulated to a\ntotal of K29.3 million, slightly more than the value of the concessional\nloans the government had received from overseas (K28.6 million).\nDuring the 1980s, about 60 per cent of Agriculture Bank loans have\nbeen allocated to agriculture compared with about 25 per cent of (a\nmuch larger volume of) loans by commercial banks.\n\n4 See Gonzales-Vega (1977) for an elaboration of this argument. Related issues are discussed in McKinnon (1973) and Braverman\n\nand Guasch (1986).",

(Unfortunately, similar data for commercial banks\nare not available.) Since its inception in 1967, the Agriculture Bank has\nlent one-quarter of its funds to coffee producers, another quarter to\ncocoa and palm oil producers and a further quarter to livestock\nproducers. This concentration on lending to the small subset of\nenterprises which tend to involve farmers who are at the upper end of\nthe income distribution for rural producers is certainly not inconsistent\nwith the predictions of the above theory.\n\nMoreover, the average size of the loans shown in Table 3.3 hardly\nsuggests that most of the loans are going to smallholders. Even though\nabout three-quarters of the coffee and cocoa in Papua New Guinea is\nproduced by smallholders, they would be receiving only a small frac-\ntion of the loans provided to those industries if the average loan is of\nthe order of K60,000.\n\nBecause of the uneven geographic distribution of the key industries,\nthis lending pattern also ensures that most of the funds since 1967\nhave gone to only a few provinces: 22 per cent to Western Highlands\nand Eastem Highlands (primarily coffee), 27 per cent to New Britain,\nNorth Solomons and New Ireland (primarily cocoa and palm oil) and 26\nper cent to Port Moresby and Morobe (primarily intensive livestock).\nThese also happen to be by far the most wealthy regions of Papua\nNew Guinea.\n\nA further effect of subsidies via the government's Agriculture Bank is to\ncrowd out potentially more efficient suppliers of credit. One piece of\nevidence for this supposition is provided in Table 3.4. With the fall in\ncoffee and cocoa prices in 1981 and the projected further decline in\n1982 and 1983, the Agriculture Bank cut back its lending programs for\nboth enterprises. The number of loan approvals and the total value of\nloans approved in 1982 were each about one-third that of 1981. A\nsomewhat smaller cutback occurred in 1985. In both instances, how-",

Certainly there would\nno longer be cheap loans, but this would only harm better-off farmers\nwho are net borrowers. Other borrowers might even enjoy a drop in the\neffective interest rate at which they can borrow. Also, with an expan-\nsion in the number of commercial bank branches and agencies in rural\nareas (e.g. at post offices), together with their ability to offer depositors\na higher interest rate in the absence of concessions on loans, there\nwould be greater opportunities and incentives for rural people to\ndeposit surplus funds in the banks, thereby expanding the total resour-\nces available for lending. Furthermore, these benefits from such a\nreform would grow over time as the commercialization of agriculture\nexpands, providing both extra depositable funds as well as extra\ndemand for loans to purchase modern inputs.\n\nIn summary, there seems to be no valid efficiency argument for\nsubsidizing agricultural credit, and the equity argument turns out to be\nnot simply invalid but perverse in that subsidized credit tends to help\nlarger producers and wealthier regions at the expense of poorer people\nand areas.

This would\nreduce the intersectoral wage differential and hence bring some urban\nunemployed back to the land, reducing the unemployment pool. The\nopportunity cost of this extra labour for the agricultural sector would be\nzero. For example, in Figure 3.3 if a subsidy of XY was paid to each\nunit of labour in the agricultural sector, the wage received in that sector\nwould equal that in the formal sector, Wr, so there would be no\nunemployment. The extra MN units of labour formerly unemployed but\nnow employed in agriculture would generate extra output represented\nby area MNXV, which is a pure gain. In addition, there would be a\nfurther gain due to reduced violence and its associated costs in the\ntowns and cities.\n\nIt may not be feasible to provide direct subsidies to subsistence labour\nbecause of high disbursement costs. Nonetheless, much the same\nresult could be achieved by investing public funds in rural education,\nhealth and infrastructure so as to make life in the villages more attrac-\ntive and hence raising real incomes indirectly — and at the same time\nboosting overall economic growth (see Chapter 7). A somewhat blunter\ninstrument would be an export subsidy for agricultural output. Alterna-\ntively, investing in technical progress in either sector would reduce\nunemployment, as can be seen by shifting the VMPL curve for the\nexpanding sector towards the axis for the other sector in Figures 3.3 or\n3.4.\n\nNumerous qualifications to this analysis can be made, and have\nbeen made in the literature (see, for example, Corden and Findlay\n(1975) and Khan (1980)). Nonetheless, the conclusion remains that\nhigh minimum wages in the formal sector reduce aggregate output,\nand possibly also agricultural output and employment. Also, assistance\nto non-rural activities may exacerbate rather than reduce urban un-\nemployment as well as decreasing agricultural output and\nemployment. This latter point is taken up in the next chapter.\n\nMoreover, there is another effect of high urban wage laws on\nagriculture which is becoming increasingly more important to\nsmallholders as they expand their cash cropping and their use of\npurchased inputs. This has to do with the cost of handling inputs and\noutputs beyond the farm. Farmers in Papua New Guinea are price\ntakers both as exporters and as purchasers of inputs. This means that\nany increase in input costs — because higher wages have to be paid\nby supplying firms — or any wage-induced increase in transportation/\nprocessing/marketing costs, will be passed on to farmers.

Some policies are introduced\nwith the aim of encouraging a particular industry, either to satisfy\nnational development objectives or to placate a special interest group\nin return for its political support. Other policies are introduced simply to\nraise government revenue. Typically, however, all such price-distorting\npolicies have much wider ramifications than are envisaged by their\nProponents or by the government which introduces them. The previous\nchapter discussed some of these effects in relation to markets for the\nprimary factors of production. The purpose of this chapter is to focus on\nthe effects on agriculture of policies affecting relative product prices. In\ndoing so, the issue of taxation is inevitably raised and so tax policies\nalso need to be considered.\n\nThe first part of the chapter examines policies which affect agricul-\ntural product prices directly. These include food import barriers and\nminor export taxes on tree crops. However, they are only part of the\nstory because agriculture is affected also, in indirect but nonetheless\nmajor ways, by policies which effectively tax or subsidize other sectors\nand by exchange rate policy which alters the price of tradable products\nrelative to goods and services that are not tradable internationally.\n\nAgricultural product price distortions\n\nUnlike many other primary-exporting developing countries, Papua New\nGuinea does not impose heavy taxes on its agricultural exports. Since\nIndependence, export taxes have amounted to no more than 2.5 per\ncent of the value of agricultural exports and have contributed only\nabout 2 per cent of central government internal revenue. Thus coffee,\ncocoa, coconuts, palm oil and the like are directly affected very little by\nagricultural pricing policy in Papua New Guinea. Production of food\nother than coconuts, however, is an import-competing activity and so is\naffected directly by the government's policies towards imports.\n\nIn the 1970s import duties were not large on average, representing\nbetween 3 and 6 per cent of the total value of all imports. During the\n1980s, this percentage has been increasing, from 8 per cent in 1980 to\n12 per cent in 1984 and 1985. By 1986 most goods imported into\nPapua New Guinea, except those specifically designated duty free,\nwere subject to a general import levy of 7.5 per cent of value, on top of\nwhich there are additional duties. As a result of this escalation, import",

In addition, like tariffs they implicitly tax consumers insofar\nas they raise domestic prices, again to varying extents.\n\nFrom 1986 restrictions on rice, mutton flaps and canned fish imports\nwere lifted because these foods had become important items in the\ndiet of people with cash purchasing power. Cheap cuts of beef for\ncanning and wheat for milling also are allowed in duty free for process-\ning by domestic firms. However, many other major foods faced import\nbans, the intention being to raise food self-sufficiency and encourage\ndomestic production. These include fresh fruits and vegetables —\nexcept for limited quantities into Port Moresby which is somewhat\nisolated from domestic producers of these products — as well as\nsugar, eggs, pork, poultry, beef prime cuts, canned meat and flour.\n\nThese import bans raise the extent of gross food self-sufficiency in the\ncountry. Also, they have encouraged the development of some new\nagricultural industries, notably sugar cane, and the intensive produc-\ntion of broilers, eggs and pork using modern grain-feeding techniques.\nThey have been less successful in raising the share of traditional\nvegetables and fruits that are marketed because the latter face high\ndomestic transport costs relative to their value. Also, these protective\npolicies have made only a minor contribution to net self-sufficiency of\nlivestock and poultry products. This is because\n\no those industries depend on feedgrains which have to be imported;\n\na feedgrains have a relatively high landed (cif) import price because\nshipment volumes are small;\n\nfeedmixing is more costly in Papua New Guinea than elsewhere;\n\nfeed is a large component of production costs (two-thirds in the case\nof broiler production); and\n\n0 feed conversion ratios are still high in Papua New Guinea, except in\nbroiler production where the technical efficiency of producers has\nincreased dramatically during the past decade (Jarrett and Anderson\n(1988)).\n\nFor all these reasons it is possible that almost as much foreign\nexchange is being spent on importing the feed ingredients for the\nmodern livestock sector as would be spent if the final product were to\nbe imported from a low-cost supplier.\n\nEven if these policies were judged to be worthwhile for food self-suf-\nficiency reasons, two other considerations need to be kept in mind.\nOne is that, while these policies promote import competing activities in\nagriculture, they are reducing the resources available for producing\nthose export agricultural products in which Papua New Guinea has a",

Rural labour, agricultural land and\nfinancial capital that is attracted to these protected activities could be\nmore profitably employed in other activities, including agricultural ex-\nports.\n\nThe second consideration has to do with consumers of food. Restric-\ntions on food imports both raise the price of food and reduce the\nquantity, quality and variety of food nutrients available to the popula-\ntion. A very sizeable proportion of the population, including many of the\npeople in rural areas, are net buyers of food, that is, they spend more\non buying food than they earn through selling produce from their\ngarden. These people are adversely affected by policies which restrict\nfood imports. And since poorer people tend to spend a larger share of\ntheir income on food than richer people, this form of implicit taxation\naffects poor people relatively more. It affects them not only directly but\nalso indirectly in the sense that a less nutritious diet weakens their\nhealth and hence lowers their labour productivity and raises their\nmedical expenses, given their relatively low state of health (see Table\n1.6).\n\nTo illustrate some of these points, it is instructive to examine the trend\nin Papua New Guinea’s meat markets. During the 1970s, meat con-\nsumption rose substantially as diets changed with increased\nurbanization and monetization, so that by 1979 total meat consumption\nin Papua New Guinea slightly exceeded the developing country\naverage at about 16 kg per capita per year (Table 4.1). Much of that\nconsumption growth was due to the increased availability and declining\nreal prices of imported beef, canned meat and chicken. Then, around\n1982, the import quotas introduced in 1975 were replaced by prohibi-\ntions on imports of high-quality beef, chicken and canned meat (but not\nmutton flaps). The reduction in available supplies combined with a fall\nin real GDP per capita in Papua New Guinea resulted in an overall fall\nin meat consumption from 16 to 13 kg per capita. It would have fallen\nmuch more had it not been for the availability of imported mutton flaps,\nper capita consumption of which has quadrupled during the 1980s. But\nhad chicken been freely importable, its price would have been almost\nhalf what it was in the mid 1980s, in which case consumers would have\nhad a cheaper — and a less fatty — alternative to mutton flaps, and\noverall meat self-sufficiency would have been little different insofar as\nimported chicken is a substitute for imported mutton. Similarly, the\nbanning of canned meat imports has done little to affect meat self-suf-\nficiency as the new domestic canning industry still has to import most\nof its meat, not to mention its machinery and all the tin cans. From the\nviewpoint of consumers this trade policy has meant higher prices for\ncanned meat and a reduction in the variety of brands available.\n\nCertainly some jobs have been created in the industries protected by\nthese food import policies. For example, the Ramu sugar project is\nproviding the country’s sugar needs, about 2000 tonnes of beef is\nmarketed each year as a result of the government's cattle development\nprojects, close to 10,000 tonnes of chicken meat is now being\nproduced domestically per year, and so on.

The protected domestic price of the less-refined sugar produced\nby Ramu was about three times the world price in the mid 1980s; many\nsmallholders in the beef industry have found their managerial skills are\ninsufficient to allow them to compete with larger producers, even at\nhighly protected prices, so an increasing proportion of output from this\nindustry is being supplied by largeholders; and while the broiler in-\ndustry in Papua New Guinea is becoming more technically efficient in\nterms of mortality rates and feed conversion ratios, it can continue to\ndo so only by increasing shed sizes which means that production\nwould be in the hands of fewer, but larger, suppliers. In short, the\nnumber of employment opportunities created by the government's food\nimport restrictions is smaller than was originally envisaged, and may\nwell be much less than the number of jobs lost through diverting\nresources away from more-efficient industries.\n\nNon-agricultural product price distortions\n\nImport restrictions and prohibitions apply to many manufactured goods\nalso. While Papua New Guinea’s tariffs may not be as high and uneven\nas that of some other developing countries, together with quantitative\nimport restrictions they have become increasingly more protective\nsince Independence.

First, it bids up\nthe price of intersectorally mobile resources such as labour and (if its\ninternational mobility is restricted) financial capital, so raising the cost\nof agricultural production. Second, insofar as it reduces the demand for\nforeign exchange, it raises the value of the kina relative to what it\notherwise would be. This lowers the price in kina terms that farmers\nreceive for their tradable products, just as happens when the exchange\nrate strengthens because of foreign capital investment in and exports\nfrom the country’s mines (as discussed in Chapter 2). Thus agricultural\nproducers earn less because of both higher production costs and lower\ngross receipts. This reduces their incentive not only to produce today\nbut also to invest in agriculture for future output growth.\n\nNot all policies aimed at boosting manufacturing output have had\nthis adverse effect on agricultural production, however. Papua New\nGuinea, like many primary-exporting countries, has from time to time\nrequired some primary products to be processed to some extent before\nbeing exported. This typically has the effect of reducing aggregate\nexports of that product group (primary plus processed) because of the\nuncompetitiveness of the processing activity. As a result, the exchange\nrate depreciates and this raises the kina value of exports of other\ntradable sectors. Insofar as these policies apply to non-agricultural\nprimary products the agricultural sector would expand as a result.\n\nA clear example of the effects on exports of this form of regulation is\nprovided by Papua New Guinea’s forest products industry. During the\n1970s the government required forest industry investors to establish\nfacilities for processing logs into sawn timber, plywood, chipboard and\nthe like, rather than expand their log exports. Processing costs are high\nby international standards, however, because of Papua New Guinea’s\nhigh wage structure and because of the large number of species in the\ncountry’s natural forests so that economies of scale in processing are\ndifficult to obtain. In addition, many timber-importing countries have no\ntariffs on logs but tariffs on processed timber. These tend to be higher\nthe greater the degree of processing. The effect of this structure of\nescalating tariffs in the international market for timber products is to\ndepress the price exporters can receive for processed timber relative\nto that for logs. Together these factors made it extremely difficult for\nfirms to process logs profitably in Papua New Guinea, and some firms\nwho endeavoured to do so in the 1970s have since simply abandoned\ntheir plants to avoid further losses.\n\nIn response to this disappointing performance, the goverment\ndecided in 1979 to change its policy to allow increased exports of logs.\nThe response by producers was immediate and dramatic. After being\nstatic for a decade, the volume of log exports trebled between the late\n1970s and mid-1980s (Figure 4. 1). It is true that, when firms were no\nlonger required to process timber before exporting it, the exports of",

This raises the question of what is an optimal trade policy\nregime for raising a given amount of tax revenue. It is not appropriate\nto analyse this issue in detail here as it needs to be considered as part\nof overall tax policy.* Even so, two points are worth making. First,\nmany quantitative barriers and prohibitions on Papua New Guinea's\ntrade could become a source of additional tax revenue simply by\nconverting these non-tariff barriers into tariff barriers. Even if their\ntrade-restricting effects remained unchanged, they would be likely to\nboost customs revenue substantially. If the protection levels on the\nmost protected items were to be lowered somewhat, the revenue\ncollected from the larger volume of imports could be even greater. In\naddition, there would be efficiency gains from reducing the average\nlevel of protection and the dispersion in the tariff structure.\n\nThe second point is more radical. Would it be more efficient to use\nexport rather than import taxes in Papua New Guinea? Traditionally,\neconomists have argued vigorously against high taxes on agricultural\nexports of developing countries because of the efficiency losses in-\nvolved,® but in a situation where high barriers to imports are in place\n\n4 Among recent analyses of tax policy in Papua New Guinea are the studies by Mathews (1980), Neild (1980), Bird (1984) and Collins\n\n(1985).\n\n5 For adiscussion of this literature and of the politics of this policy issue in the African context, see Bates (1981).",
    "Page_80": "DISTORTIONS IN PRODUCT MARKETS 61\n\nthose efficiency losses are occurring anyway. A tax on imports is\nequivalent to a tax on exports, in that both forms of tax encourage\nimport-competing production at the expense of production of export-\nables.® There could be a number of economic advantages to be gained\nfrom a complete overhaul of the trade policy regime which involved\nremoving all barriers to imports and replacing them with a flat rate of\ntax on exports. One obvious advantage would be the lower cost of\ncollecting export taxes. Already the administrative machinery is in\nplace to collect, say, a 10 per cent levy, while savings could be made\nfrom eliminating the customs service which collects import duties.\nSecond, the wide dispersion of rates of protection to import-competing\nproducers would disappear, so there would be additional efficiency\ngains from reallocating resources among the import-competing in-\ndustries. Third, if the government made it clear that import restrictions\nwere to be available no longer, fewer resources would be spent on\nlobbying for this costly form of intervention. Finally, it would be seen as\namore equitable form of taxation not only because it would remove the\nunequal rates of import taxation but also because smallholder tree\ncrops exporters, who currently pay no direct taxes other than the 2.5\nper cent export levy, would be seen to be making a larger direct tax\ncontribution, although in fact they are already currently being taxed\nimplicitly, as mentioned earlier, by the policy of import restrictions.\n\nThe policy of a uniform export tax could be fine-tuned, for example\nby using Ramsey's (1927) optimal trade tax rule to exploit any differen-\nces between commodity markets in terms of their supply and demand\ncharacteristics, but in Papua New Guinea's case such differences are\nprobably insignificant. Of more importance is the need to ensure that\ninvestment incentives to mining companies are not reduced.”\n\nAnother concern might be that such a policy change would remove\ndifferences in import barriers which reflected differences in the desired\ndegrees of consumption taxation of imported luxury items. This can be\nremedied easily by placing an explicit consumption tax at the desired\nrate on luxury items. Such a tax also has the advantage over an import\ntax of not encouraging domestic production of such non-necessities,\nsince an import tax is equivalent to a consumption tax and a production\nsubsidy on the good concerned.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe need to reduce Papua New Guinea is not alone among developing countries in harm-\nsiatciore inpesedey ing agriculture through export taxes, through protection to\npolicies 9 non-agricultural industries, and through maintaining an overvalued\ncurrency (Krueger, Schiff and Valdes 1988). Indeed it may well harm its\nagricultural sector much less than occurs in other developing\ncountries. This does not alter the fact, however, that Papua New\nGuinea could enliven its agricultural sector — and indeed the economy\n\n6 On the symmetry between import and export taxes, see Lemer (1936). Clements and Sjaastad (1984) provide empirical estimates\nfor a number of developing countries of the extent to which import taxes are borne by exporters.\n\n7 The complexities of extracting rents by taxing mineral productior/exports are analysed in, for example, Garnaut and Clunies-Ross\n(1983) and Lloyd (1985).",

Allowing\nthe kina to move closer to its equilibrium level would encourage the\nproduction of tradables (including agriculture) relative to non-tradable\ngoods and services. Replacing quantitative import restrictions and\nprohibitions with import tariffs would raise government revenue. If the\ntariffs on the most restricted items were set at levels that were less\nrestrictive than current import barriers, there would be two additional\nbeneficial effects. The efficiency of resource allocation within the im-\nport-competing sector of the economy would improve, and agricultural\n(and other) export sectors would be more able to exploit their compara-\ntive advantages because of fewer resources being attracted to\nuncompetitive import-replacement industries.\n\nAn even more radical change would involve replacing all import restric-\ntions with an export tax. As more direct forms of taxation become less\nexpensive to collect, so the need for trade taxes as a means of raising\ngovernment revenue would diminish and hence the rate of export\ntaxation could be lowered gradually over time. This form of taxation, it\nshould be reiterated, would need to be a substitute for, rather than an\naddition to, import restrictive policies if it were not to discriminate\nagainst agriculture. There are two major weaknesses in such a\nproposed policy change. One is that the source of its major economic\nbenefit — the removal of differing rates of price distortion for different\nimportables — is also the source of the main advantage of the present\npolicy regime from the viewpoint of politicians, namely, that it can be\nused to disperse political favours to politically supportive vested inter-\nests. The second and related weakness is that, if import taxes were\nless than fully reduced to offset the resource reallocative effect of\nraising export taxes, the outcome would involve an even more ineffi-\ncient use of resources, especially if the dispersion in import tax rates\nacross industries were to increase. If there is a reasonable probability\nof the latter occurring, it would probably be better simply to stay with\nthe existing trade policy and work towards reducing the average level\nand the dispersion of import duties and phasing out quantitative import\nrestrictions.",
    "Page_82": "Commonly-stated reasons\nfor operating stabilization\nschemes\n\n— to smooth out\nfluctuations affecting the\nwider economy\n\n—to stabilize producers’\nincomes\n\nAgricultural stabilization policy\n\n \n\nThe two previous chapters have been concerned with policies which\ndirectly affect the trend level of prices to which producers respond. This\nchapter is concerned with policies which alter the fluctuations in product\nprices around trend levels, that is, with price stabilization schemes.\nPapua New Guinea has stabilization schemes for cocoa, coffee, copra\nand palm oil (for smallholders only), as well as for mineral export\neamings. After discussing the stated objectives of these schemes this\nchapter examines the potential gains and losses from them in Papua\nNew Guinea. It concludes that, contrary to conventional wisdom, these\nstabilization schemes may well be unnecessary for macroeconomic\nStability and at the same time they are a disincentive to agricultural\nproduction and growth. In particular they may reduce the welfare of\nsmallholders.\n\nObjectives of agricultural stabilization policy\n\nThe usually stated reason why Papua New Guinea operates stabiliza-\ntion schemes for agriculture and minerals is that the year-to-year\nfluctuations in the country’s export earnings, when passed on to\nproducers, would ‘seriously disrupt progress towards broad develop-\nment goals’ (Guest 1987a:1). According to this view the transmission of\nlarge fluctuations in export earnings to the domestic economy would\ngenerate instability in the demand for non-tradables and thereby make\nit difficult for firms to plan. The spending of goverment tax revenues\nwould also be difficult to manage. In addition, there would be upward\npressure on wages in periods of high export earnings as trade unions\nsought a share in the boom. Because of downward rigidity in wage\nsetting, this would be difficult to reverse when export earnings fell.\nThus\n\nfrom a macro point of view, the commodity stabilization funds have\na contributory role towards management of aggregate demand for\ndomestic and imported goods and services so as to complement the\nnormal fiscal and monetary instruments practised by the Govern-\nment (Kiele 1987:4).\n\nWhile macroeconomic stabilization has been the most frequently\nstated objective of these schemes since Independence, it was not\nalways so. The copra price stabilization scheme introduced in 1946,\nand the scheme for coffee which came into effect in 1966, were both\naimed at stabilizing producers’ incomes. This was to be achieved by\nPlacing a levy on the export price in high-price years and drawing from",
    "Page_83": "64 GROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nthe fund into which those levy receipts were deposited in low-price\nyears. The same type of arrangement operates for the cocoa and palm\noil schemes, introduced in 1974 and 1983 respectively.\n\nHow successful have the schemes been in achieving these two\nstated objectives and how do their effects compare with those of\nalternative policy instruments? As a prelude to addressing these ques-\ntions, it is helpful to examine the extent to which the variation in\nagricultural export eamings is due to fluctuations in prices rather than\nquantities.\n\nSources of variation In agricultural export earnings\n\nVariations in export earnings arise because of variations in prices\nand/or quantities sold. It is clear from Figures 5.1 and 5.2 that both\nprice and quantity for Papua New Guinea’s major agricultural export\ncrops have fluctuated substantially.' To determine the relative impor-\ntance of these two sources of fluctuations, it is helpful to make use of\nthe statistical technique shown in Box 5.1.\n\n \n\n1 As shown in Table 1.8, these four export items accounted for two-thirds of the country’s total export receipts in the 1960s and more\nthan half of the non-mineral export eamings in the 1970s and 1980s.",

During the past decade, their end-year deposits\nhave averaged around 20 per cent of M3. What is relevant, however, is\nhow much the money supply would have differed if the change in the\nend-year deposits of those funds had not taken place, assuming other\nthings remained unchanged. The final column of Table 5.2 shows that\nthis change since 1975 has been very small (no more than 5 per cent)\nexcept during the period of extraordinarily high coffee prices in the late\n1970s. So in aggregate terms the agricultural stabilization funds have\nmade little difference to the broad money supply.\n\nMismatch of changesin —_ Also worth noting from the point of view of macro stabilization is that\nexport earnings and there is a somewhat imperfect match between the change in export\nrae instabilization —_ garmings and the change in stabilization deposits. This results partly\nfunds f - Fs . 4\nbecause of lags in the change in the levies following an export price\nchange, and partly because the quantity of exports is also varying with\nchanges in seasonal conditions and, with a lag, in response to price\nchanges. The data in Table 5.3 for coffee illustrate the point. The 1976\nprice for coffee was more than double that for 1975. Also the quantity\nof coffee exported rose by 30 per cent, partly in response to the price\nrise. As a result, the value of coffee exports in 1976 was three times, or\nK67 million more than in 1975. Yet only K3 million was added to the\ncoffee stabilization fund. The 1977 changes in the export value and\nfund deposit were much more closely matched, but in 1978 when the\nprice of coffee fell 40 per cent, the levy was still in place and fund",

The only exception is coconuts, where a small\nproportion of production is consumed domestically. In this situation, the\neffects of the schemes on the welfare of domestic consumers can be\nignored. Also, because Papua New Guinea contributes such a small\nshare (no more than three per cent) of world exports of these products,\nit is a price-taker in the international market. Producers face a set of\nalmost perfectly elastic demand curves. These two facts make it rela-\ntively simple to analyse the welfare effects of the country’s agricultural\nStabilization schemes.\n\nFirst, to what extent have the schemes stabilized producers’ export\nincomes? A crude way of examining this is to compare gross export\nreceipts with receipts that are net of the change in stabilization fund\ndeposits, as in Table 5.4.° For coffee, cocoa and coconut products\nduring the period 1976 to 1986, the average absolute variations in net\nexport receipts were 18, 6 and 32 per cent respectively below varia-\n\n3 The fact that part of the change in fund deposits is due to interest earned on the balance each year has had to be ignored here\nbecause of lack of data on interest income.",

One is\nthat producers’ net export receipts grew less than they would have\nwithout the schemes over this period, assuming the schemes themsel-\nves did not affect the long run trend in supply (see below). The final row\nof Table 5.4, showing the mean (arithmetic average) change in receipts\nbetween 1976 and 1986, indicates the extent to which the growth in\nproducers’ receipts has been dampened. For coconut products, there\nhas been virtually no growth in either gross or net receipts. For both\ncocoa and palm oil, however, receipts net of fund deposits have been\ngrowing at about K4 million per year less than gross receipts, and for\ncoffee the difference is about K10 million per year. This reflects the fact\nthat the funds (other than for coconuts) have been accumulating since\nIndependence.\n\nCan it be assumed that long run trends in supply are unaffected by the\nschemes? Insofar as production is positively correlated with the price\nreceived (an upward sloping but not vertical supply curve) and new\ninvestments in expanding output are negatively correlated with price\nfluctuations, stabilization of prices will have dampened fluctuations in\nproduction and raised the long run trend rate of growth of production.\nAs it happens, though, producer prices have not been stabilized very\nmuch by the schemes because of the way the schemes have been\noperated. In the case of coffee, for example, stabilization levies have\ndampened the average annual fluctuation in the producer price by only",

First, their\nincomes would be reduced insofar as the trend level of prices is\nlowered by the schemes as a result of funds accumulating, and as\nalready mentioned this has certainly happened in Papua New Guinea.\nIn the case of coffee, for example, producer prices rose on average by\nonly K31 per tonne per year between 1976 and 1986, whereas they\nwould have risen by K263 per tonne per year without the scheme\n(Table 5.5). And second, even if the trend level of prices was not\naffected, producers’ net revenue would be lowered simply because the\nsupply curve is not vertical (Oi 1961). This point is illustrated in Box 5.2.\n\nExport prices in practice are not as well behaved as depicted in Figure\n5.3. Rather, they fluctuate unevenly around an unknown long run trend.\nThis means that during any given period, there is considerable uncer-\ntainty facing the stabilization authority.

Producers in countries\nnot operating stabilization schemes would have more incentives to\nexpand output, undertake investments and improve their competitive-\nness through greater productivity gains than would producers in Papua\nNew Guinea.

Thus it is not at all\ncertain that the presence of these schemes will attract more invest-\nment resources to export crops. Indeed, it may even result in less\ninvestment.\n\nWhy have stabilization schemes?\n\nTo summarize, this analysis suggests that agricultural price stabiliza-\ntion schemes operating in Papua New Guinea have made little if any\ncontribution to macroeconomic stabilization, and in any case the\nmonetary and fiscal policy instruments in place could accommodate\nagricultural export earning fluctuations and be more efficient than\nstabilization schemes for achieving this macro objective. At the same\ntime, these schemes have imposed on growers a form of forced\nsavings which, it can be argued, has reduced the degree of investment\nand productivity growth in export-oriented agriculture. Moreover, the\nstabilization schemes have done very little to stabilize producers’ in-\ncomes from agricultural exports and have reduced their average export\nearnings.\n\nWhy then are these schemes operating? Why not have growers\ninvest their earnings in high price years and draw on these investments\nin low price years? One possible explanation is that the government\nfeels people would consume rather than invest in high price years, if\nnot for their own sake then because of wantok obligations.® However,\nthis paternalistic motivation is not relevant for largeholders and nuclear\nestates run by management agencies. Furthermore, the experiences\nof developing countries as a group does not support the view that\neconomies will grow less rapidly the more unstable their export earn-\nings (Lim 1976, Michaely 1977).\n\nA final point to make is that it is likely that the supply curve for\nsmallholders is much more price elastic than that for largeholders.\nAccording to the analysis in Box 5.2, this would mean that largeholders\nwould lose less from price stabilization than smallholders. In addition,\nlargeholders tend to have shares in the firms which process the\nagricultural raw product prior to export. When producer prices are\nstabilized, the throughput of these plants is also more stable, which\nraises the plants’ average profitability. Thus largeholders may gain\noverall from stabilization schemes, even if smallholders lose. If the\ngovernment is genuinely interested in boosting the welfare of\nsmallholders, it may need to reassess the presumed virtues of price\nstabilization schemes.\n\n5 See Bauer and Paish (1954) for a similar comment.

If\nProductivity growth occurs less rapidly in agriculture than in other\nsectors, this will contribute to the relative decline of agriculture in a\nsmall open economy. Slow productivity growth in agriculture will be\nespecially debilitating to the sector if there is a decline in agriculture’s\nterms of trade in the intemational market place. This may be because\nof economic growth elsewhere in the world, as there has been in the\nlong run (see Figure 2.2). Or it may be because there is a boom in one\nof the other tradable sectors of the domestic economy, as there has\nbeen with mining in the case of Papua New Guinea (see Chapter 2).\n\nPapua New Guinea is abundantly endowed with agricultural land rela-\ntive to population, having more than four times as many hectares per\ncapita as developing countries as a whole (Table 3.1). However only a\nvery small proportion of that land is being used for cropping or pasture:\nless than 2 per cent has been permanently cleared of native timber. It\nis true that much of the country’s forest land is too mountainous or\notherwise unsuitable for converting to arable land, but a great deal\nmore than is currently used could potentially be put to agricultural uses.\n\nSome of the reasons for land remaining in its forest state have already\nbeen discussed. One is that land tenure is difficult to secure. Another is\nthat input costs are high (high rural wages for largeholders, high real\ncosts of obtaining finance for smallholders). A third reason is that\noutput prices for Papua New Guinea’s export crops are kept artificially\nlow by protection and stabilization policies and in addition they have\nbeen lowered in kina terms by the exchange rate appreciation as-\nsociated with the mining boom.\n\nThis chapter and the next are concerned with a fourth set of factors\nwhich interact with the previous three, namely, public investments\nwhich can improve the profitability of agriculture and thereby enhance\nboth the amount of resources employed in agriculture (particularly\nland) and the productivity of those resources. The relatively slow\ngrowth in land and labour productivity in agriculture in Papua New\nGuinea, reported above in Table 1.13, suggests this is an area deserv-\ning close scrutiny.\n\nProductivity growth is typically defined as an increase in output per\nunit of (one or all) inputs. However it is misleading to suggest that this\nsimply comes about, for example, by transferring technologies",

In fact, increasing output\nper hectare or per person requires local investment (Schultz 1964). In\nthis chapter the focus is on investment in the production and dissemi-\nnation of new, lower-cost means of combining land, labour, financial\ncapital and other inputs to generate agricultural output. The next chap-\nter examines investments in improving the quality of the labour force in\ntural areas.\n\nHistory of investment in agricultural innovations'\n\nInnovation in Melanesian agriculture has its origins in the beginning of\nagriculture itself. Traditional crop varieties have evolved through the\nselection of new cultivars as adaptation to local environments occurred\n— a classic case of leaming by doing. According to Denoon and\nSnowden (1981), Melanesians possessed and understood a wide\nrange of food plants for thousands of years, and could easily have\nadded cultivation to their foraging activities. That capacity is further\nstressed by Vasey (1981) who traces the development of the major\nagricultural systems of Papua New Guinea. These were essentially\nwoody fallow systems where the undergrowth is slashed, the trees cut\ndown, the debris burnt and mixed vegetable gardens established.\nTraditionally, men carry out the heavy work of clearing, buming and\nbreaking up the large soil clods but thereafter women take over. The\ngardens are usually based on the stable root crops (sweet potato, taro\nand yams) along with a wide variety of other crops. In the more\nwater-logged areas of Papua New Guinea, sago is the major staple\ngrown.\n\nAs a result of centuries of adaptation and improvement there is now a\nvery extensive range of crops grown both for food and medicinal\npurposes. Carman (1980) lists almost eighty food crops that are\nplanted in gardens on New Britain, ranging from staples through green\nvegetables to fruit and nuts. In addition, at least twenty-five plants have\nbeen grown for medicinal purposes. Knowledge of such plants is\napparently widespread throughout Papua New Guinea. Holdsworth\nand N’Drawii (1973) document the extensive use of plants for\nmedicinal purposes in Manus Province. Bulmer (1982) lists some\ntwenty-eight species of traditional cultivated food plants involving some\n120 cultivars, including more than forty each for sweet potato and taro\nalone. In addition to the knowledge of plants, Papua New Guineans\nhave developed an extensive knowledge of soil management — in-\ncluding fertility control, tillage practices, irrigation and drainage (Wood\nand Humphreys 1982). Kesavan and Aburu (1982) also suggest that\nPapua New Guineans were aware of the need to conserve the genetic\ndiversity in their plants and were able to select cultivars for particular\npurposes, including the development of soft bananas for babies. The\ntraditional knowledge systems relating to the use and conservation of\nnatural resources, in addition to those specific to agriculture, are dis-\ncussed in Morauta et al. (1982).\n\n1 Much of this and subsequent sections draw on the more detailed analysis in Jarrett (1986).",

This is a classic case of\n‘poor but efficient’ (Schultz 1964) traditional agriculture.\n\nThe learning by doing mode has also been important in the plantation\nsector where commercial pressures are of greater significance. Tea\ngrowing in Papua New Guinea has had a chequered career but the\nindustry has been materially assisted by the development of a\nmechanical tea picker. The difficulties of obtaining an adequate labour\nsupply in the tea-growing areas induced the development of this labour\nsaving device. This innovation was mainly the result of trial and error\nby growers themselves with support from specialized engineering\ngroups. In a similar vein, a prototype dehusking machine for coconuts\nhas been developed in East New Britain.\n\nDespite these developments in both the smallholder and plantation\nsectors, innovations which rely solely on the leaming by doing mode\nare inadequate once a country embarks on the path of modern\neconomic development. As tree crops became more important earners\nof foreign exchange and as cash cropping expanded to supplement\nactivities in village gardens, innovation generated from learning by\ndoing was supplemented by formalized agricultural research and ex-\ntension carried out by institutions specifically developed for those\npurposes. Indeed, the national returns from such formal science-based\ninvestments continue to increase because the stock of basic scientific\nknowledge is expanding rapidly around the world. Ruttan (1983)\nbelieves that the fundamental reason for the differences in agricultural\nproductivity growth between countries is the differing degrees to which\nthey under-invest in science-based agricultural research.\n\nThe early work of the chemists Davy, Liebig and Lawes highlighted the\nlinkage between chemistry and agricultural practice and resulted in the\ndevelopment of fertilizers as well as complex agricultural chemicals\nused for plant and animal protection. The principles of genetics, first\nenunciated by Mendel in 1866, led plant scientists towards a directed\nselection of new cultivars with improved characteristics. At the same\ntime, the link between science and agriculture increased public aware-\nness of further links between education, science and agricultural\nPractice and led to the development of publicly funded institutions —\nuniversities, research institutes, government departments — which\nwould facilitate the generation of agricultural innovations.\n\nIn the advanced industrial economies, the farm sector has come to rely\non an increasing proportion of non-farm produced inputs. In many\ncases, improved technology is embodied in these inputs. The farm\nsupply industries have themselves turned to funding agricultural re-\nsearch and development, and farmers have been the recipients of the\nchanged technology. Firms supplying agricultural chemicals, veterinary\nmedicines and farm equipment have become increasingly important\nsources of agricultural innovation.

Even in Papua New Guinea, where the\nfarm supply industries have not developed to anywhere near the extent\nthat they have in the industrial countries, the export tree crops sector at\nleast relies on the innovations generated by private firms. The adoption\nin Papua New Guinea of chemicals such as the fungicide Ridomil and\nthe weedicide Roundup are the result of privately funded research in\noverseas countries. While there is, as yet, relatively little use of fer-\ntilizer in the smallholder production of cocoa and coffee, there is\nsignificant usage on large holdings. In the field of mechanical innova-\ntions, at least one firm in Papua New Guinea is adapting imported\nfarming equipment to fit local conditions.\n\nMany of the chemical and mechanical innovations arising from private-\nly funded research and development are based on commercial criteria\nrelated to potential profitability. Such innovations may owe little, if\nanything, to input from smallholders in Papua New Guinea who may\nhave very little awareness of the potential role their needs can play in\ninfluencing the types of innovations which are produced. As Bieri, de\nJanvry and Schmitz (1972:802) indicate ‘they are not only price takers\nbut, on the whole, also technology takers’. Largeholders, on the other\nhand, are aware of the potential role of agricultural research and\ndevelopment in developing innovations. This has conditioned their\nwillingness to support research from industry funds to the point where,\nin Papua New Guinea, coffee, cocoa, copra and palm oil research is\nnow being partially funded by means of a levy on all producers of these\ncommodities. Also, in the case of some of the export tree crops which\nare subject to further processing, the processors of the raw material\nmay support research. In Papua New Guinea the definitive epidemiol-\nogy of vascular streak dieback in cocoa by Keane (1972) was the result\nof post-graduate work done at the University of Papua New Guinea,\nwith funding support from the Confectionery Manufacturers of\nAustralia. Similarly, in Ghana and Nigeria, the International Office of\nCocoa and Chocolate (a manufacturers’ organization) supports re-\nsearch.\n\nAnother source of innovation for any one country is the direct transfer\nof technology from other countries. At any time there is a stock of\nagricultural innovations and scientific knowledge which is potentially\ntransferable from one country to another. In general, knowledge is\noften a free good. However, access to knowledge is not free because\nthere are costs in searching for the knowledge and the success of any\nsearch is related to the capacity to identify the sources of information\nwhich are relevant for local agricultural practice. Many countries have\nbenefited from direct transfer. In the United States agriculture had\naccess to a stock of knowledge, as well as the proprietary artefacts,\nwhich the European settlers brought with them. Moreover, they\nbenefited from the indigenous crops and practices which had already\nbeen developed by the American Indians. Australian agriculture, by\ncontrast, because of different environments, benefited relatively less",

Agriculture in Papua New\nGuinea certainly has benefited from international technology transfers.\nPalm oil material from Malaysia and sugarcane varieties from Australia\nare examples. Another example is the modern broiler industry, which\nhas adopted the technology used in industrial countries (Jarrett and\nAnderson 1988). In addition, new varieties of vegetables were intro-\nduced, evaluated for local performance, and eventually grown in\nvillage gardens. In a longer time frame, the original varieties of\ncoconut, cocoa and coffee were all introduced to Papua New Guinea\nfrom overseas.\n\nEconomics of investing in agricultural innovations\n\nLike all investment, the rate of return to additional investment in\nagricultural research and extension is likely to fall as the level of\ninvestment expands. The question of what is the appropriate level of\nsuch investment for the various agricultural crops is a very complex\none, and one which cannot be answered in detail here. However, it is\npossible to consider some of the elements that would make up suchan\nanswer. Specifically, the following issues are addressed, at least\nqualitatively:\n\na Is Papua New Guinea under-investing in agricultural research?\n\na Is the allocation of research resources between agricultural in-\ndustries appropriate?\n\nao Towhat extent should the government be providing research funds?\n\na Are the proportions of research expenditure in public and private\ninstitutions optimal?\n\na Are the types of innovations produced of benefit to both largeholders\nand smallholders?\n\no Is the government investing the right amount of resources in agricul-\ntural extension?\n\nToo little research investment in aggregate\nIn 1986 and 1987 the Department of Agriculture and Livestock in\nPapua New Guinea spent K5.2 million per year on crop and livestock\nresearch and development. That is equivalent to about 0.5 per cent of\nthe gross value of agricultural production. This is well below the propor-\ntions for developing countries and for industrial countries, which in\n1980 were close to 1 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively (Judd,\nBoyce and Evenson 1986). It is true that the private sector also has\ninvested in agricultural research in Papua New Guinea, but in the past\nthis has amounted to only about one-third of government expenditure\n(ISNAR 1982:100). Thus the sum of both public and private spending\nis still probably well below 1 per cent of the value of agricultural output.\nAnother way to assess the level of investment in agricultural re-\nsearch in Papua New Guinea is to compare the number of",

In the absence of detailed data for rate of return on\ninvestment calculations, Boyce and Evenson (1975) propose a simple\ncriterion for suggesting whether research resources are being allo-\ncated efficiently between products. On the assumption that the cost of\nmaking a worthwhile discovery is comparable across products, their\nmethod is to compare research expenditure per dollar's worth of\nproduction of each crop.\n\n2 Qualifications concerning the methodologies used are discussed by Lindner and Jarrett (1978) and Norton and Davis (1981), among\n\nothers.",

The rest of agriculture can then be handled\nas a residual, as explained in the notes to that table.\n\nBy this simple criterion it would appear that, among the export crops,\nthe degree of underinvestment in research in Papua New Guinea is\ngreatest for coffee and coconut products and least for palm oil and\nrubber. A thirteen-fold difference between the research intensities for\nthese crops suggests that there is a serious misallocation of research\nresources between the various export commodities. A similar inference\nmight be made with respect to the low research intensity for non-export\ncrops. However, since there are significant economies of scale in\nagricultural research (Evenson 1969), one might expect it to be optimal\nto conduct no research on minor non-export crops, which would lower\nthe desirable research intensity for this group of products.\n\nThere has been some recognition of the apparent imbalance in\nresearch expenditure between the main export crops. In Volume 1 of\nthe National Development Plan of 1986, there are proposals to more\nthan treble the Department of Agriculture and Livestock expenditure on\ncoffee research during 1986-90 and to increase by a factor of 2.5 the\nexpenditure on cocoa and coconut research. In particular, the poten-\ntially large scale losses from the outbreak of coffee rust in 1986\nunderscore the need for further coffee research. It remains to be seen\nwhether these proposed increases in research funding materialize.\n\nTo date, private funds for cocoa, copra, coffee and palm oil research\nhave been collected via a levy on producers. These levies in 1988\nwere K22 per tonne of wet beans for cocoa, K0.92 per tonne for copra,\nK18 per tonne of green beans for coffee and K0.65 per tonne of fresh\nfruit bunch for palm oil. At 1984-87 average unit export prices, these",
    "Page_104": "AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION 85\n\nlevies represent 1.3 per cent of the price for cocoa, 0.4 per cent for\ncopra, 0.7 per cent for coffee and 0.2 per cent for palm oil. These are\nrelatively small levies by international standards. In Brazil, for example,\nthe levies for cocoa and coffee are more than three times those in\nPapua New Guinea.\n\nWhile a closer analysis of data on the amount and product distribu-\ntion of research expenditure in Papua New Guinea would be helpful, it\nis clear from this cursory overview that total expenditure on agricultural\nresearch falls far below the optimal level, and that the existing expen-\nditure is not well distributed across different products.\n\nWho gains from agricultural research?\nTo assess the appropriateness of government funding of research and\nthe optimal mix of public and private sector research, it is necessary to\naddress the issue of who gains from investment in agricultural re-\nsearch. The knowledge generated from research can lead either to\nprocess innovations (reducing unit production costs) or to product\ninnovations (enhancing the quality of the product). In terms of conven-\ntional economic analysis, the former shifts down the supply curve, the\nlatter shifts up the demand curve. Insofar as the demand curve is a\ncurve at the farm level, derived from the consumer demand curve (the\nvertical distance between these two demand curves being the costs of\ntransportation, processing, wholesaling and retailing), innovations in\nmarketing will also have important distributional effects. Since process\ninnovations are likely to dominate in Papua New Guinea, what follows\nwill focus primarily on them.\n\nThe effects on the market for a particular product whose unit costs\nof production have been lowered are depicted in Figure 6.1 in Box 6.1.4\n\n \n\n3 For more detailed analyses of the distributional effects of agricultural research, see Edwards and Freebairn (1981, 1982 and 1984)\nand Freebairn, Davis and Edwards (1982).\n4 Hayami and Herdt (1977) and Alauddin and Tisdell (1986) provide detailed analyses of casesinvolving subsistence production.",
    "Page_105": "86\n\n \n\nProducers are the main\nbeneficiaries of agricultural\nresearch\n\nGROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC POLICY\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nO Q; Quantity —\n\nFor many of Papua New Guinea’s staple foods the domestic demand\ncurve is probably fairly elastic because of the availability of exotic\nsubstitutes. For example, imported rice or wheat flour are increasingly\nbeing preferred to staples such as sweet potato or taro. Similarly,\nimported canned fruit and vegetables are often considered more con-\nvenient than the local fresh alternative. Thus the benefits of innovation\nwould be shared between producers and consumers and it is quite\npossible that the bulk of the gain would go to producers rather than to\nconsumers.\n\nIn the case of an export crop, the distributional outcome is clear.\nSince Papua New Guinea is a price taker in intemational markets (its\nshare of world exports for each of its major export crops is no more\nthan 3 per cent), any shift in its supply curve will have a negligible effect\non the international price level. Thus if, in Figure 6.1, Po was the export\nprice, the quantity produced would increase from Qo to Q1’ following\nthe adoption of the new innovation, with the gain EoE1’0 accruing\nexclusively to producers. Even if there were some domestic consump-\ntion of the product in question, domestic consumers would be\nunaffected as they would continue to pay the export price Po.®\n\nThis brief analysis suggests that producers are likely to be the major\n— and, in the case of export crops, the exclusive — beneficiaries of\ncost-reducing agricultural research.

Even\nwhen producers benefit more than consumers from innovations there\nis still a role for the goverment in agricultural research, for two\nreasons. First, for many types of process innovations the gains from\nresearch are difficult to capture. This is especially so in plant breeding,\nwhere a new high-yielding variety, once released, can be propagated\neasily. Capturing the gains from research is less difficult for chemical\nand mechanical innovations where private firms have access to the\nPatent system with royalties to recover costs of research and develop-\nment. Where the free-rider problem is significant, there is a role for the\ngovernment in collecting levies from producers to fund research. This\nis a simple matter in the case of export crops which are channelled\nthrough a small number of processing/exporting points. It may be\nprohibitively expensive to collect a levy from either producers or con-\nsumers of many staple food crops, however, in which case the\ngovernment may consider it worthwhile to fund such research from\nconsolidated revenue rather than see little or none undertaken.\n\nThe second reason for government involvement in agricultural (and\nother) research is that there are often externalities associated with\nsuch activities. The reason universities become involved in applied\nagricultural research is that applied research often has spillover\nbenefits both to more fundamental scientific research and to teaching.\nSometimes, agricultural research stations can be located adjacent to a\ntertiary education institution to take advantage of these externalities,\nespecially if the stations are in the public rather than the private sector.\n\nThere is a further reason why the government may prefer to have\nresearch conducted in the public sector, particularly for tree crops\nwhich are grown by both largeholders and indigenous smallholders.\nSince the factor prices faced by largeholders often differ markedly from\nthose faced by smallholders (see Chapter 3), technologies could be\ngenerated which are much more appropriate for one group than for the\nother. For example, rubber research in Malaysia has been biased\ntowards selecting for breeding those high-yielding trees which use\nfertilizer and growth stimulants but require less labour because they\nhave low tapping intensities. The new technologies save land and\nlabour but are intensive in their use of cash inputs and skilled manage-\nment and so are more appropriate for largeholders than smallholders\n(Barlow and Peries 1977; Barlow and Jayasuriya 1984). If it were\njudged that such a bias is undesirable and is more likely to result from\nprivate rather than public research institutions, this may be a further\nreason for setting up public agricultural research stations.®\n\n6 There are, however, reasons why a public research institution may be rather inefficient at delivering appropriate technologies for\nsmallholders. See, for example, Pray (1979, 1983), Anderson (1981) and Jarrett (1986).",
    "Page_107": "88\n\nDegree of public v. private\ninvestments research\n\n— apparent scope for\nmuch more in private\nsector\n\n—and for research to be\ngiven priority over\nextension in future\ninvestment expansion\n\nNational research and\nregional extension: the\nneed for closer linkages\n\nGROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nWith these considerations in mind, it is clear that the amount of agricul-\ntural research that should be publicly funded, and the proportion of\nresearch that should be conducted in public rather than private re-\nsearch institutions, involve a degree of subjective judgement by the\ngovernment. Even so, on the latter point (the proportion of research\nundertaken in the public sector), it is instructive to examine the data in\nTable 6.2. About 35 per cent of research manpower, excluding exten-\nsion and administration, is employed in private research centres. When\nextension and administration are included, the private share is 26 per\ncent. This compares with an average for Asia in 1974 of 28 per cent of\nagricultural research manpower in the private sector (Boyce and Even-\nson 1975), so in aggregate Papua New Guinea would appear to be not\ngreatly different from neighbouring countries in this respect.\n\nWhen attention is focused on individua! export crops, however, there\nappears to be cause for concern. There are no a priori reasons why the\nproportion of palm oil and coffee research undertaken in the private\nsector (83 and 79 per cent, respectively) should be any greater than for\nthe other tree crops. If that were to be taken as the benchmark, it\nsuggests a much larger proportion of the total research budget for the\nother export crops might be offered to the private sector rather than\nkept in the public sector. Indeed, there are already signs that producers\nrecognize this. A Cocoa and Coconut Research Institute has recently\nbeen established at a government experiment station at Kerevat, to be\nfunded primarily by a levy on cocoa producers because of the com-\nplementarity between cocoa and coconut production.\n\nExtension investment: how much and by whom?\n\nAccording to Table 6.2, about one-eighth of all research and extension\nworkers in the Department of Agriculture and Livestock are employed\nin extension/liaison activities. In addition, many extension officers are\nemployed by the nineteen provincial governments. The Organic Law of\n1977 provided for agricultural research, specialist technical training,\nmarketing and planning activities to remain with the national\nbureaucracy but for agricultural extension to become a provincial\nresponsibility. Thus, for the country as a whole, the share of research\nand extension manpower in extension work is perhaps as much as\none-fifth or more. This is higher than in Southeast Asia where, in 1974,\nonly one-eighth of research and extension manpower was devoted to\nextension (Boyce and Evenson 1975). Moreover, in Southeast Asia,\nretums from further investments were much lower in extension than in\nresearch even at that low share of one-eighth (Evenson and Kislev\n1975). Together this evidence suggests that, in expanding research\nand extension resources, priority should be given to research.\n\nThe deficiencies in the top-down nature of the research and extension\nprocess in Papua New Guinea, where research is a function of the\nnational government and extension is a function of the provincial\ngovernments, were revealed with the outbreak of coffee leaf rust in\n1986. The central and provincial governments were unable to mobilize\nquickly and effectively the necessary resources for a research and\nextension program to counteract the likely serious consequences of",
    "Page_108": "AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION 89\n\nProblems arising from the\ndivision of research and\nextension\n\nthe spread of coffee leaf rust. So the central government established\nthe Coffee Development Agency which is a joint enterprise between\nthe national government, the Coffee Industry Board and the five provin-\nces where coffee production is concentrated. The funds for the agency\nwere obtained by a levy of K0.1 per kilogram of green coffee with an\ninitial injection of K1.8 million from the national and provincial govern-\nments. The Coffee Development Agency realized the need to begin the\ncampaign against coffee leaf rust at the local level, that is, to adopt a\nbottom-up approach in which the concemed villages are involved\ndirectly. The villages are to appoint coffee managers who are chosen\nfrom the village community and who will receive a payment to begin a\nleaf rust control program in their own coffee gardens and serve as a\nnucleus to advise neighbouring farmers. The village coffee managers\nwill be supervised by 220 district managers covering the major coffee\nproducing areas. These in turn will be supervised by five assistant\ngeneral managers. Regional managers are to be chosen from the\nexisting provincial extension services and by general recruitment allied\nwith training courses run by the authority.\n\nA joint operation between the national and provincial governments\nis also envisaged in the cocoa and coconut smallholder rehabilitation\nand extension project. This project combines the services of four\nregional cocoa and coconut co-ordinators from the Department of\nAgriculture and Livestock with the support of the provincial extension\nStaff. While the rehabilitation project does not have the same urgency\nas the outbreak of coffee leaf rust, it does represent at least a begin-\nning of the development of linkages between the national goverment\nand the provincial Departments of Primary Industry. Such linkages are\nessential as long as research is a function of the national govemment\nand extension a function of the provincial governments.\n\nThe number of people employed in an activity is not necessarily a good\nindicator of the value of the services provided. As it happens, the\nsplitting of extension from research — transferring extension respon-\nsibilities to the provincial governments — has led to a marked\ndeterioration in the quality of extension services, as well as to a\nreduced flow of information from farmers back to researchers. This\nproblem, which is discussed in more detail in McKillop, Williamson and\nAssociates (1982), Kern ef al. (1984) and Jarrett (1986), is also high-\nlighted in a major review by the World Bank (1981). This review\nconcluded that ‘The operation of the extension services in the field left\nmuch to be desired. Many staff were engaged in a range of activities\nonly marginally related to extension work, there were only a limited\nnumber of extension programs, and there was little supervision of\nextension activity.’ It recommended the re-establishment of an Exten-\nsion Division within the national Department of Agriculture and\nLivestock to provide regional support units to assist provincial exten-\nsion officers, as well as the withdrawal of provincial extension officers\nfrom non-extension activities.",

This project was expected to involve 136\nnational and twenty-four expatriate staff in research, education and\ntraining, extension support, economics and planning, agricultural\nproject development and regulatory services. The emphasis on exten-\nsion and training is evident from the budgeted costs of the project\nshown in Table 6.4. Unfortunately, however, the implementation of the\nproject, in the sense of recruiting the necessary professional and\nsupport staff, has not proceeded as rapidly as would be required to\nrevitalize the activities of the Department of Agriculture and Livestock.\nOnly a handful of appointments had been made by 1987 and some of\nthe loan has been cancelled.\n\nGiven the poor performance of the public sector in delivering extension\nservices, and the emergence of non-government research institutions\n(in part because of that poor performance), perhaps more of the\nextension work should be left to the private sector. Indeed that has\nalready begun to happen, both for export tree crops and for broilers\n(Jarrett 1986; Jarrett and Anderson 1988).

However, in an environment where population\ngrowth has accelerated because of reduced warfare and improved\nhealth care, and where villagers’ aspirations to purchase marketed\ngoods have increased faster than their cash incomes, new forms of",

First, it would appear that the overall level of investment in\nagricultural research and extension is well below the optimal level.\nThat is, further investment in this area is likely to provide a very high\n(though not necessarily immediate) return in terms of expanded\nagricultural and national income. Second, the present investment ap-\npears to be poorly allocated.’ Too little is going to research relative to\nextension, and of the research expenditure probably too little is going\nto the main export crops of coffee, coconuts and, to a lesser extent,\ncocoa relative to palm oil, rubber and tea. Nor is enough going to\nresearch into non-export products.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean the goverment should greatly expand\nits public research and extension activities, at least for export crops. It\nmay be more appropriate for the government to facilitate the collection\nof levies from export producers for the expansion of producer-owned\nresearch and extension institutions. The same may be true for the\nlivestock industries. Indeed, the modern broiler industry in Papua New\nGuinea provides a good example of what can be achieved (Jarrett and\nAnderson 1988).\n\nWith respect to staple food crops, the prognosis is less clear-cut. Gains\nfrom research on staples that are non-tradable (because of their\nperishability) are likely to be shared by producers and consumers, with\nproducers gaining a larger share the lower the proportion of production\nthat is marketed. But the costs of collecting levies or tax revenue from\nproducers or consumers of these low value products, in order to\nfinance research on them, are probably prohibitive. The pertinent ques-\ntion is whether the government should fund research and extension on\ntraditional staples out of consolidated revenue. Carrad and Bourke\n(1985) believe more research on sweet potato, taro and sago is war-\nranted. On the other hand, empirical work based on a model developed\nby Davis, Oram and Ryan (1987) suggests the retums from such\nresearch is likely to be much lower than from research on major crops.\n\nIn this connection, the sensitive issue of food self-sufficiency arises.\nMany politicians and other leaders in Papua New Guinea believe it is\nmorally wrong or shameful for the country to import food. However, this\napparent concern has not been matched by extensive investments in\nStaple food crop research, it may simply be a mask for protecting\nvarious groups involved in new import-replacing food industries.\n\nMoreover, villagers themselves have not sought such research. A\nstudy of eight highland villages concluded that villagers in this survey\n\n7 Both this and the previous finding are not surprising given the long term nature of agricultural research and the relative strengths of\nthe relevant vested interest groups. See Anderson (1981) and Rose-Ackerman and Evenson (1985).\n\n8 For example, the recommendation by ISNAR (1982) to establish two food crop research centres, one for the highlands and one for\nthe coastal! areas, as part of the planned expansion of agricultural research and extension activities, has not been implemented as\nquickly as was originally envisaged.",

There was very little interest in new\nsubsistence crops to supplement their diets (Harris 1975). The same\nconclusion is reached by Kern et al. (1984) in studies in the provinces\nof Milne Bay, East New Britain, Southern Highlands and West Sepik,\nwhich indicated the same emphasis on the cash economy, markets\nand infrastructure. The Food and Agriculture Organization/United Na-\ntions Development Program (1983) commented that there appeared to\nbe little political pressure coming from rural areas for resources to be\ndevoted to food production. Demands most voiced by the rural people\nwere for better roads, improved communications and higher incomes\nfrom cash crops.

Furthermore\n| suspect that many people feel that improvements to subsistence\nfood production, in so far as they are desirable, must be sought\nthrough their own efforts (Morauta 1983:156).\n\nThese examples would seem to indicate that there is a strong\ndesire by villagers to become more involved with cash crops rather\nthan with traditional staples.\n\nSince (i) the retums from further research investment in tropical\nexport crops are likely to be much larger than from research into\ntraditional food staples, (ii) the urban population appears to prefer the\nprotein rich foods available through imports, and (iii) farmers prefer to\nexpand into cash cropping for export, it would seem sensible to spend\nthe scarce funds available for research and extension on enhancing\nthe country’s comparative advantage in tropical tree crops and continu-\ning to use the export revenue so generated to pay for some imports of\npreferred foods.",

Adam Smith drew attention\nto education as a profitable investment activity two centuries ago in his\nWealth of Nations. More recently, T.W. Schultz was awarded the Nobel\nPrize in economics for his work in highlighting the contribution that\ninvestments in the health and skills of people could make to economic\ndevelopment and poverty alleviation. He stressed in particular the\nimportance of investing in rural people in developing economies such\nas Papua New Guinea's. He and his students have demonstrated\nclearly that education in rural areas makes two key contributions. First,\nit makes farmers more adept as managers adjusting to changes such\nas fluctuations in prices or the introduction of new farm technologies.\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, it improves rural people’s\ncapacity to cope with moving out of agriculture (see, for example,\nWelch 1970; Huffman 1974; Schultz 1971, 1975, 1980; Jamison and\nLau 1981). Farmers who are better educated earn higher incomes\nbecause they are quicker and better at making use of new tech-\nnologies and adjusting their input and output mixes to take advantage\nof changes in relative prices. In addition, those (usually younger)\nmembers of rural households who choose to seek a non-farm job — for\nexample, because of a lack of farm land — tend to find work faster and\neam a higher income the better their education. The latter point is\nespecially important in Papua New Guinea’s case because most of",

In addition, education makes a number of more subtle contribu-\ntions, perhaps the most important being that children tend to be\nhealthier and do better at school — and subsequently in the workforce\n— the more educated their parents, especially their mother. So even if\nwomen spend less time in the workforce outside the home than men,\nthey contribute very significantly to the country’s development through\nthe environment they provide for their children, and more so the better\neducated they are (Psacharopoulos 1988; Psacharopoulos and Wood-\nhall 1985).\n\nAmong the important questions which need to be addressed when\nassessing the appropriateness of Papua New Guinea's expenditure on\neducation are the following:\n\no Is there evidence to show that incomes are positively correlated with\neducation in Papua New Guinea?\n\nIs Papua New Guinea underinvesting in education?\n\nIs the allocation of expenditure between primary, secondary and\ntertiary education appropriate?\n\na_ Is there balance in the allocation of expenditure between rural and\nurban areas, between males and females, and between provinces?\n\no Is there scope for improving the efficiency of supplying educational\nservices and/or raising the quality of those services?\n\nWhile it is not possible to answer all these questions in detail here,\nat least a beginning is made.\n\nThe answer to the first question is a definite affirmative, at least for\nwage earners in Papua New Guinea. A recent study by Gannicott\n(1987), which examines incomes of groups with different levels of\neducation and experience, shows that (i) the more education people\nhave when starting work, the greater their income; and (ii) as their work\nexperience increases, the benefit from greater education tends to\nincrease (see also Bray and Smith 1985: ch.1). These results are\nsummarized in the age/earnings profiles shown in Figure 7.1. The\nintercepts on the vertical axis, which represent starting incomes, are\nhigher the more education people have, and so too are the average\nslopes of the lines shown, which represent the rates of increase in\npeople's incomes as they gain work experience. While similar data are\nnot available for Papua New Guinea’s non-wage earners, who\ndominate the rural sector, the very extensive empirical evidence from\nmany other developing countries suggests the same pattem is likely to\nexist among them, and is likely to become more pronounced the more\nsubsistence farmers become integrated into the cash economy and\nexposed to new production technologies and changing marketing op-\nportunities (see, for example, the literature cited in Jamison and Laua\n1981).",

This alone might suggest Papua New Guinea is underinvesting in\nformal education, except that one needs to keep in mind that mass\neducation in the country is a recent phenomenon. At present, the\ncentral government is spending a relatively large share of its budget on\neducation compared with other developing countries. In 1986 that\nshare was 17 per cent, but in earlier years since Independence it has\nbeen as high as 20 per cent (compared with 13 per cent in 1975). Since\nPapua New Guinea’s central government accounts for a larger share of\nGNP than governments in most other developing countries, this means\npublic expenditure on education as a percentage of national income in\nPapua New Guinea is high, in fact more than double that for develop-\ning countries as a whole (Table 7.1).

The private investment\n\ncosts incurred by an individual — or more likely the family of the\nstudent — include not only direct costs for fees, books, etc. but also,\nand more importantly, the indirect cost of income foregone during the\nperiod of study. Typically, the private rate of return on these costs will\nexceed the social rate of return since the student does not pay the full\ncost of tuition (both recurrent and capital). Ideally, one should include\nthe ‘consumption’ benefits of education to the individual in calculating\nthe private rate of return, and in estimating the social rate of return any\nexternalities to society from having a better educated population\nshould also be included. In practice, however, these are difficult to\nquantify, so one simply needs to keep in mind that both rates of retum\nwill be underestimates.\n\n—butappeartobevery One Set of estimated rates of return, calculated by Gannicott (1987), is\nhigh at the primary level —_ summarized in Table 7.2. These estimates refer to Papua New Guinea\nnationals, and show the marginal rates of return a student could expect\nin 1979 from going one more rung up the education ladder. For ex-",

Even for students already\nwell into primary school, the private rate of return from going on to\ncomplete his/her primary education is estimated to be still as high as\n20 per cent. The social rates of return from primary and early secon-\ndary schooling, while less than the private rates, are still high\ncompared with alternative investments the government might make.\n\n— and to decrease with Notice, though, that the marginal rates of retum tend to be less, the\n\nhigher levels of education higher the student's education. This partly reflects the greater oppor-\ntunity cost of the more educated student's time, as depicted in Figure\n7.1. But it also reflects the higher cost of tuition at the more advanced\nstages, both in terms of fees paid by the student and — especially at\nthe national high school and tertiary levels — in terms of the residual\ncost of tuition and scholarships met by the central government.\n\nAid directed at education How do Fapua New Guinea's rates of return compare with those of\nnot going to the primary —_ other countries? Table 7.3 suggests the social rates of return in other\nlevel where it is most developing countries are, as in Papua New Guinea, highest at the\nneeded A 5\nprimary level and lowest at the tertiary level. It also suggests they are\na little higher than in Papua New Guinea at the primary and secondary\nlevels, but that at the tertiary level Papua New Guinea's rate of retum\nis extremely low by international standards. In a recent study on\nAustralian aid for education in the Pacific, Throsby and Maglen (1988)\nestimated that 64 per cent of aid allocations were at the tertiary level,\nwith 16 per cent to primary and secondary levels and 14 per cent to\nvocational and technical education. In their view, the acute problems in\neducation in the Pacific are in the primary and secondary school\nsectors and in teacher training, the shortage of trained teachers being\nseen as a major constraint on educational development.\n\nIn short, these estimates show Papua New Guinea on the one hand\nto be underinvesting in education less than other developing countries\noverall (lower overall social rates of retum), but on the other hand to be\ndevoting more resources than other developing countries in supporting\nupper secondary and tertiary education at the expense of more\nelementary education. This emphasis on resources to upper secon-\ndary and tertiary levels is reinforced by Australian aid to education.",

The annual cost per\nstudent of providing education in Papua New Guinea in 1983 was\nK150 at the primary level, K360 at the provincial high level and K730 at\nthe vocational high school level. However, at the upper secondary level\nit was K2000, and at the university level K7900 per student. Moreover,\nthese cost differences between elementary and advanced education\nhave widened considerably since 1973 (Table 7.4). Presently, the\nexpenditure per student at the university level in Papua New Guinea is\nmore than double that in Australia. This reflects the fact that the\nstaff/student ratio in Papua New Guinea is more than double\nAustralia’s and that a larger proportion of students in Papua New\nGuinea have to live away from home for their advanced education and\nthe government subsidizes their living costs as well as travel to their\nhome villages during vacations. Yet, despite this high level of govern-\nment support for advanced education, the output of first-degree\ngraduates is depressingly small and that of higher-degree graduates is\nalmost non-existent. In the context of staffing agricultural research\nagencies in Papua New Guinea, the International Service for National\nAgricultural Research (1982) predicted that, by the end of 1987, there\nwould be a need for nine national scientists with Master's degrees for\nthe research staff of the Department of Agriculture and Livestock, as\nwell as twenty-two undertaking Master's programs and three in Ph.D.\nprograms. Yet, in 1988, there was not a single national with a Master’s\ndegree working in agricultural research, there were six candidates\nundertaking Master's programs overseas and there were no Ph.D.\ncandidates in training.\n\nClearly, there is considerable scope for reallocating some of the\ngovernment’s expenditure toward more education at the elementary\nlevels. In 1986, only 52 per cent of the central government's education\nbudget went to the primary level compared with 16 per cent to secondary",

Perhaps surprisingly, the primary pupil/teacher ratio in\nTable 7.5 shows relatively little variation between provinces. Insofar as\nthis is an indicator of the quality of education, it suggests that there are\nsmaller inter-provincial differences in quality than in quantity of primary\nschool education in rural areas. In addition, the difference between\nmale and female participation rates has narrowed since Inde-\npendence: nationally, the proportion of girls enrolled rose from 35 to 43\nper cent in primary schools and from 31 to 36 per cent in high schools\nbetween 1973 and 1983.\n\nThe overall quality of the educational services provided in Papua New\nGuinea has been a cause of some concern as the government's policy\nof indigenization of all public services takes effect. As Goodman et al.\n(1985:175) noted, by 1976 all teachers in primary community schools\nwere nationals. Since then, the proportion of provincial high school\nteachers who are nationals has risen from around one-third in 1983 to\nmore than three-quarters, while in community teachers’ colleges it has\nrisen from 16 to 37 per cent over that period. If the skills of these\nnationals are lower than those of the expatriate teachers they are\nreplacing, there may be cause for concern about the quality of the\neducational services that will be provided by the public sector in the\nfuture.\n\nAn additional means of boosting human skills is to make more use of\nnon-formal adult education. As discussed in the previous chapter,\nagricultural extension services contribute in this way in the rural sector.\nTo some extent, these services compensate for the fact that many of\ntoday’s farmers in Papua New Guinea — particularly women —\nreceived little or no formal education as children. Unfortunately,\nthough, the approach adopted by extension officers was not always\nskill-enhancing. There is a tendency for extension workers to short cut\nthe education process. That is, they develop farm management plans,\nrather than teaching farmers methods of planning. This is one reason\nwhy extension workers have never been able to implement a farm\nmanagement extension program reaching the masses of farmers\n(Maunder 1963).\n\nThe history of agricultural extension in Papua New Guinea would\ntend to substantiate Maunder’s findings. An extension officer (didiman)\nbegan by introducing village smallholders to new commodities and\nthen added the managerial skills needed to market the output. The\ndidiman originally acted as a decision-maker in the sense of taking the\ndecision to participate in the project. On the second visit, often in the\nrole of loan officer for the bank financing the project, more of the\nmanagerial function was taken over and thereafter the smallholder\ncame to regard the project as the didiman’s rather than his own, and\nmoreover blamed the didiman if the project failed.\n\nThere are certainly examples in Papua New Guinea where individual\ninitiative in management functions has been taken at the village level.\nSome ofthese initiatives were fostered by churches and by Agricultural",

However, the examples are rela-\ntively few and far between and they tend to have a short life history.\nTypically, they rely heavily on the human skills and initiatives provided\nby a few people who assume a temporary leadership role, and once\nthat leadership role is no longer assumed the initiatives tend to fade or\ncollapse.\n\nEven so, such initiatives are to be encouraged since the development\nof a bottom-up based agricultural extension service with its focus on\nadult education — and particularly directed at women — may con-\ntribute more to agricultural development in smallholder agriculture than\nreliance on a top-down direction from the national to the provincial to\nthe district to the individual farmer. Far too often the hierarchical\nstructure of national and provincial governments means that extension\ninformation passes from secretary to deputy to assistant secretary to\ndirector to deputy director before it finally reaches the district officer\nwho has to interact with the farmer in a way that makes sense to the\nfarmer concerned. In such circumstances, the district officers often feel\ndisenchanted in the performance of their extension duties since they\nare a long way removed from the source of the knowledge they are\ndisseminating. Moreover, the reverse flow of information from farmers\nthrough the district officers back up to the research scientist in the\nlaboratory is virtually non-existent.\n\nHealth\n\nAs with education, the central goverment is spending a substantially\nlarger share of its budget on health care services in Papua New\nGuinea than is the case in many other developing countries. In 1986,\nthat share was almost 10 per cent, up from 5 per cent in 1975, which\nrepresents 3.3 per cent of GNP or about three times the developing\ncountry average (Table 7.1). As a result of this high level of spending,\nand the government's conscious policy to improve basic health ser-\nvices in rural areas, there has been a substantial improvement since\nIndependence in health service staff per capita (Table 7.6). While\nPapua New Guinea still has less than half as many doctors per capita\nas the average developing country, it has perhaps twice the average\nnumber of nurses per capita, according to data compiled by the World\nBank (1988:278).\n\nThis improvement in health care services, together with the reduction\nin tribal warfare, no doubt contributed to the increase in the average life\nexpectancy from 40 to 50 years between the 1971 and 1980 censuses.\nInfant and child mortality rates halved over the same period. Although\nthese indicators are still poor compared with many other developing\ncountries (see Table 1.6), the extent of improvement in the nation’s\nhealth since the early 1970s is quite considerable.\n\nNevertheless, major diseases remain, and their relative importance\nhas not changed much (Table 7.7). Respiratory diseases will continue\nto head the list while rural people continue to sleep around smoky fires\nin poorly ventilated houses. Malaria remains endemic in coastal areas",

For the strategy to succeed there is a\nneed not only to deliver pertinent information on how diseases may be\nprevented but also to involve the local community in maintaining and\nimproving its own health. Unfortunately, as with large scale agricultural\nextension projects, this type of large scale health project depends\nCritically on the skills of the personnel involved and the project often\ndegenerates when those skilled people leave.

Almost half of the central\ngovernment's health expenditure is on hospitals, which is about twice\nthe share in neighbouring countries of East and Southeast Asia\n(Richardson 1986). Given that most observers believe the weakest link\nin the delivery of health services is at the interface between the aid post\nand the village population, some reallocation of funds away from\nhospitals may be warranted. Goodman et al. (1985:167) suggest this\ncould be accommodated by expanding the number of urban health\ncentres so that they can provide (at considerably lower cost) those\nservices which are currently the responsibility of overcrowded out-\npatient departments of hospitals. They also suggest, incidentally, that\nthe government consider contracting more of the primary health\nservices and the training of orderlies to the churches, who are able to\nprovide those services at lower cost than public authorities.",
    "Page_123": "104\n\nHigh transport costs are a\nburden on producers and\nconsumers\n\nRoad network is extremely\nlimited\n\nTransport costs likely to be\nmore effectively reduced\nby road maintenance than\nby new road construction\n\nGROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nTransportation\n\nIn a lightly populated country such as Papua New Guinea, with its\ndifficult terrain and numerous outer islands, transport and handling\ncosts necessarily play a large role in the economy. The exporter of\ncash crops bears the full burden of these costs, since he cannot pass\nthem on to his customers overseas. As was discussed in Chapter 3\nwith respect to wage costs in marketing agricultural exports, the higher\ntransportation and handling costs the lower the price received by\nproducers and the smaller the quantity they will export (see Figure 3.5).\nThat is, transport costs are just like an export tax, except that they do\nnot generate revenue for the government. For staple food crops sold in\nthe villages and towns, the consumer shares the burden of the\ntransport cost with the producer, but the larger that cost the worse off\nthey both are and the smaller the volume and proportion of staple food\nthat is marketed. For these reasons, reducing the cost of transportation\nto and from rural areas can have a major impact not only on rural\ndevelopment (Howe and Richards 1985) but also on the retail price\nand availability of indigenous food in urban areas and hence on overall\nfood self-sufficiency. It might be argued also that easing the cost of\ntransport between urban centres and rural areas would encourage\nmore outmigration of people from agriculture and so exacerbate urban\nunemployment problems. The latter does not necessarily follow from\nthe former, however, since lower fares would also make it easier for\nmigrants to retum to their village should they have difficulty obtaining a\njob or otherwise become disenchanted with urban life.\n\nThe two most important transport and handling costs affecting the\nagricultural sector have to do with roads and ports. (Air transport is\nvery well developed and provides an extensive, if expensive, pas-\nsenger service to virtually all areas of the country.) At present, Papua\nNew Guinea has only about 19,000 kilometres of trafficable roads over\nits land area of almost half a million square kilometres. Only 6 per cent\nof these roads are sealed. They tend to be fairly evenly distributed on\na per capita basis across provinces (Table 7.8). Apart from the High-\nlands Highway connecting Lae with Mt Hagen, the road network has\ndeveloped essentially as extensions from roads in the larger towns,\nsuch as Port Moresby, Lae, Rabaul and Kieta, or as a result of upgrad-\ning patrol roads which were established in rural areas during the period\nof the Australian Administration to facilitate access to the more remote\nvillages.\n\nSmall though the road system is, it does cover the more densely\npopulated areas, and about two-thirds of the population is within reach\nof a road. Whether extensions of the road network would be socially\nprofitable is a moot point. Unlike investments in agricultural research\nand education, investments in new roads immediately provide clearly\nvisible signs of government activity and for that reason are attractive to\npoliticians. Goodman et al. (1985), however, are fairly sanguine about\nincreased investments in extending the road system. They cite en-\ngineering studies which show that none of the proposed new roads or",

On the other hand,\nfurther investment in maintaining and upgrading the existing network\nmay well yield a high return. However, activity is much less glamorous\nthan new road construction and so has less political appeal, even\nthough it would do much to reduce the cost of transporting goods to\nand from rural areas.\n\nAs with roads, Papua New Guinea can afford few ports, despite its long\ncoastline and many outer islands. In addition to Kieta, which services\nBougainville Copper Pty Ltd, there are nine important ports serving the\ntural sector, all controlled (with seven others) by the Papua New\nGuinea Harbours Board (Table 7.9). A recent study suggested that, as\nwith roads, the building of new ports in the foreseeable future would not\nbe economically justified but the rehabilitation and further development\nof these nine ports would yield quite high internal rates of return,\nranging from 13 per cent per year at Kimbe to 56 per cent at Madang\n(Goodman et al. 1985:161). For areas not serviced by these ports, the\nalternative in the absence of roads would have to be barges operating\nfrom collection points to the main ports.\n\nPhysical facilities at the major ports are divided between public —\nthrough the Harbours Board — and private ownership. Many of the\nprivately owned facilities are in the hands of firms which are engaged\nalso in international and coastal shipping as well as wholesale and\nretail distribution in Papua New Guinea. Gilman (1983:88) points out\nthat, ‘The Harbours Board, it is believed, would like to extend its\njurisdiction, whilst coastal operators are wary of this, and point to the\nfact that facilities under their own control are cheaper and more",

According to Trebilcock, the Harbours Board receives no\ndirect subsidies from the government, but distortions in the provision of\nservices exist since ‘substantial cross subsidization by some\ncategories of services to other categories of services is acknowledged\nto occur’ (Trebilcock 1982:125). In contrast to the previously mentioned\nstudy of the economic feasibility of redeveloping some of the Board's\nports, Trebilcock goes on to say, ‘Officials with the board suggested\nthat 11 out of the 16 ports operated by the Board would be closed down\nif purely economic considerations governed. However, political and\nsocial considerations have led the government to decide to maintain\nthese ports’ (Trebilcock 1982:125).\n\nLabour for stevedoring and cargo handling is provided typically by\nvillage gangs employed on a rotational basis. According to Gilman\n(1983), this method is efficient in the sense that it exploited the dis-\ncipline of the normal social structure of the village, and led to relatively\nfew problems on the waterfront. However, in Port Moresby where there\nis a permanent workforce, the potential for incorporating restrictive\nlabour practices is quite high. In part, Gilman attributes this to\n\nthe transplanting of the Australian waterfront tradition to Papua New\nGuinea which is very much to be regretted. The Australian\nwaterfront is one of the most expensive in the world, both in terms\nof direct costs and also slow ship turn-around, delays and disloca-\ntion generally. It is bad enough in Australia and a disaster for Papua\nNew Guinea (Gilman 1983:91).\n\nSome years ago the Papua New Guinea government, concerned with\nwhat it perceived as excessive coastal shipping freight rates, under-\ntook the operation of a publicly funded shipping enterprise through the\nPapua New Guinea Shipping Corporation Pty Ltd. However, the ven-\nture was unsuccessful despite government subsidies. Eventually the",

Deregulating the\ncoastal shipping market and encouraging competition among private\ncompanies probably offers the best hope of rationalizing existing\noperations and keeping down coastal freight rates.\n\nClearly, transportation costs will remain an important burden on the\nPapua New Guinea economy in general and the rural sector in par-\nticular. However, because transportation looms so large an item in the\ncost of production, it is more important for Papua New Guinea than for\nmany other developing economies that its policies do not unnecessari-\nly add to transportation and handling costs.\n\nThis last point applies not only to land and sea transport but also to\nair services. Both passenger and freight services by air are more\nexpensive than they need to be simply because of over-regulation of\nthat traffic. Lower costs would help the rural sector not only through\nlowering the fares villagers pay as passengers but perhaps also, in the\nlonger run, through boosting rural export industries such as floriculture\nand international tourism.\n\nLaw and order\n\nAccritical factor in the development of any society is the maintenance of\nlaw and order. This has proved to be difficult in Papua New Guinea in\nrecent years for a complexity of reasons related to the uneasy coexis-\ntence of two quite different sets of legal traditions in an environment\nwhere old values are crumbling and new ones are only just beginning\nto take their place (see Clifford, Morauta and Stuart 1984). The prob-\nlem is exacerbated by large differences between rural and urban\nwages, which encourage immigration to the towns where insufficient\nemployment opportunities lead to unrest. But the problem is not con-\nfined to the towns. Of major concern to coffee growers is the increasing\nincidence of robberies on the Highlands Highway during the harvest\nseason when buyers carry large amounts of cash. This raises substan-\ntially the insurance premiums paid by buyers and thereby reduces the\nprice they are able to offer growers. Since it is only the smallholders\nwho sell for cash on the highway, they bear the cost of these robberies.\n\nThe government's provision of services aimed at maintaining law and\norder suffer from the same deficiencies as those aimed at providing\nagricultural extension, and education and health services; namely,\npoor training, lack of management skills, poorly articulated policies,\nand inadequate supervision and implementation of policies. Investing\nmore public resources into this area is essential because without it the\ncost of providing other critical services escalates. For example,\nteachers and nurses are less prepared to be posted to rural areas\nwhere rape and robberies occur. Also, it has proved more and more\ndifficult in the current environment to attract expatriates required in\nfields such as agricultural research and training of teachers, doctors\nand nurses.

It is abundantly\nendowed with natural resources; it has a multi-party democratic politi-\ncal system which since Independence in 1975 has delivered peaceful\ntransfers of power via the ballot box; and it has recently discovered\nmore gold and petroleum reserves and is attracting the foreign capital\nto develop them in ways which make it the envy of many developing\ncountries.\n\nYet, despite these advantages, the economy overall — and the\ndominant agricultural sector in particular — has performed rather poor-\nly in the past 15 years and living standards for the vast majority of the\npopulation in rural areas have not improved noticeably. If Papua New\nGuinea is to make the most out of its future opportunities, including\nanother minerals export boom in prospect for the 1990s, the reasons\nfor the lack of per capita income growth since Independence need to\nbe identified and remedies sought.\n\nCertainly the external terms of trade have not favoured Papua New\nGuinea: in 1986 the price of its exports relative to its imports was only\ntwo-thirds the levels of 1965, 1970 or 1974. However, this adverse\ntrend was minor relative to the huge growth in the volume of exports.\nEven after adjusting for the terms of trade deterioration, Papua New\nGuinea's exports in 1986 were able to buy three times as many imports\nas in 1970 and ten times as many as in 1965.\n\nAssociated with this export growth there has been substantial ad-\njustment of the structure of Papua New Guinea’s economy. Agriculture\nin Papua New Guinea has declined more in its contribution to GDP,\nemployment and especially exports than in the average developing\neconomy, and there have been substantial adjustments to the mix of\nboth outputs and inputs within the agricultural sector.\n\nRapid growth in real export receipts and rapid structural adjustment\ntypically are symptomatic of rapid incomes growth. Why, then, has\nthere been so little change in the prosperity of the vast majority of\nPapua New Guineans, particularly those in rural areas?\n\nIt is not difficult to explain agriculture’s relative decline, given the\ngrowth of the mining sector. As shown in Chapter 2, this is what tends\nto happen in any economy as it develops and especially when one of\nthe other tradable sectors is booming. Agriculture’s poor performance\nin absolute terms is what needs explaining.",
    "Page_131": "112\n\n— government policies\nlargely to blame\n\n— slowness to deal with\nland tenure issues\n\n— rural credit policy\ndisadvantageous for\nsmallholders\n\n— minimum urban wage\npolicy attracts people to\ntowns and encourages\nsubstitution of capital for\nlabour\n\n— distorting effects of\nimport restrictions also\nhave harmed agriculture\n\nGROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nThis study suggests that a large part of the problem of slow growth may\nwell be due to government policies. Distortions to factor and product\nmarkets have reduced efficiency in the use of resources, and public\ninvestment policies have been less than ideal in expanding the quan-\ntity, and enhancing the quality, of various forms of infrastructure and\ncapital, especially human capital in rural areas.\n\nA major impediment to agricultural development is the insecurity of\nland tenure. Without land-use rights that can be passed to descen-\ndants, farmers are hesitant to make long term investments in improving\nthe land they are farming. As well, financial institutions are less\nforthcoming with loans when a land title cannot be offered as collateral.\nThe government needs to make a much bigger investment in finding\nways to improve the security of customary land tenure and to speed up\nthe process of issuing new titles and transferring existing titles to\nalienated land.\n\nThe difficulty smallholders have in borrowing for investment, in the\nabsence of a land title for collateral, has been compounded by the\ngovernment's rural credit policy, even though the objective of that\npolicy is to lower the cost of rural lending. Because banks are required\nto subsidize agricultural loans, it is in their interest to limit their conces-\nsional rural lending and to provide the subsidized loans only to their\nleast risky and least costly customers, who tend to be large borrowers\nwith secure collateral. Other borrowers — including many smallholders\n— are forced to borrow in the residual market at higher interest rates\nthan would prevail in the absence of this rural credit policy.\n\nWages, too, are grossly distorted. High urban minimum wages en-\ncourage people to move to the towns in search of a highly paid job. The\nmigrants who are unsuccessful in finding work are less able to make a\nproductive contribution to the economy, and a minority of them actually\nmake a negative contribution through anti-social behaviour. In addition,\nhigh wages, especially when coupled with subsidized finance, en-\ncourage firms to substitute capital for labour and so fewer jobs are\navailable. The minimum wage is not as rigidly tied to the consumer\nprice index now as it was prior to 1983, but a further decline in the real\nminimum wage is needed to reduce the inefficiencies and inequities\ncaused by this unfortunate inheritance from Australia.\n\nPapua New Guinea is not as interventionist in its product markets as\nmany other developing countries, but it seems to be gradually raising\nits import barriers just as other developing countries are seeing the\nwisdom of liberalizing their trade regimes. Agriculture in Papua New\nGuinea is not directly taxed very much relative to many other primary-\nexporting countries. But it is adversely affected indirectly, but\nnonetheless importantly, by trade barriers aimed at boosting manufac-\nturing activity. There are a number of barriers to food imports which are\ndiverting resources from low cost to high cost rural enterprises, the\neffects of which have probably been to reduce overall agricultural GDP\nand certainly to raise the cost of purchasing food and to reduce the\nvariety of nutrients available for consumption. They have done little to",

Insofar as this exchange rate policy has\nheld up the value of the kina, it has raised the price of non-tradable\ngoods and services relative to the price of tradables. The real deprecia-\ntions since 1983 have gone some way towards easing this disincentive\nfor agriculture, but further devaluation may be warranted unless the\ncountry's terms of trade improve markedly.\n\nAnother policy lesson from Papua New Guinea's experience is that\nagricultural price stabilization schemes are flawed. The schemes used\nfor the major export tree crops have contributed little towards stabiliz-\ning the macro economy, which is one of their major objectives, nor\nhave they been successful in enhancing producer welfare. Producers’\ngross receipts have fluctuated less because of the schemes but the\naverage level and growth in those receipts have been reduced by\nthem. Moreover, by dampening incentives to innovate and to expand\nduring long periods of high export prices, these schemes have probab-\nly reduced rather than encouraged more investment in export\nagriculture.\n\nIn the area of public investment, the evidence suggests that some\nreallocation of funds would yield high returns. There is clear underin-\nvestment in agricultural research, though the government's role might\nbe more one of ensuring producers contribute to research funds than\nof subsidizing and/or undertaking that research, particularly with\nrespect to export crops. Even within the existing budget, much could\nbe gained by reallocating funds between the various types of agricul-\ntural research.\n\nWithin the education and health budgets, too, gains in terms of both\nefficiency and equity could be obtained by reallocating spending\ntowards more elementary schooling and towards more small scale\nhealth care services. The social rates of return from further invest-\nments at the basic end of the spectrum of education and health\nservices are far higher than at the advanced end. It is the poorer\npeople in rural areas who would gain most from such a reallocation:\nimprovements in managerial skills and health of rural people over time\nwould contribute substantially to future productivity growth in the rural\nsector and the economy generally.\n\nPolicy implications\n\nThe clearest policy implication of the study may be unoriginal but it is\nnonetheless fundamental, namely, the need to get prices right. Remov-\ning the subsidies to rural credit would raise, not lower, the amount of\ncredit used by the bulk of farmers and at the same time would expand\nthe opportunities for rural people to participate in the financial market",

Facilitating the erosion in real terms of artificially high\nurban wages would expand employment opportunities in both urban\nand rural areas. And streamlining the issuing and transferring of land\ntitles would encourage the development and better utilization of both\nexisting and new agricultural land. That is to say, there is ample scope\nto improve output simply by allowing existing resources to be used\nmore efficiently through policy changes aimed at reducing distortions in\nthe capital and labour markets and enhancing the efficiency of the land\nmarket.\n\nGetting prices right in the product markets and in the market for foreign\nexchange would similarly boost output through allowing resources to\ngravitate to the enterprises where they can be used most productively.\nIn practice this means restricting imports less and allowing the kina to\nmove towards, and remain closer to, its equilibrium value vis-a-vis\nother currencies. Simply converting all quantitative trade restrictions to\nexplicit trade taxes would be a useful beginning, as it would generate\nextra trade tax revenue for the government. Then lowering the highest\nof those taxes would not only boost trade tax revenue even further\n(because the volume of imports would expand) but also would dis-\ncourage production in the most protected and least competitive\nenterprises. A much more radical proposal is to replace all import\nrestrictions with a uniform export tax and to impose consumption taxes\non imported luxuries. The latter would be no more disadvantageous\nthan the former from the viewpoint of export industries, and yet it would\nhave a number of advantages from society’s viewpoint. The most\nimportant of these are lower costs of administering trade restrictions\nand fewer opportunities for potential import-replacing producer interest\ngroups to seek favours from the government.\n\nThe analysis in Chapter 5 suggests the need to look critically at the\nexport commodity price stabilization schemes. If they are doing little to\nhelp stabilize the macro economy or to reduce producer uncertainty,\nand yet are reducing the average levels of producer receipts and\ndiscouraging expansionary investment during long periods of high\ninternational prices, they may not be worth keeping.\n\nAnother major policy implication of the study is the need to ensure that\ninvestments in various forms of capital and infrastructure are yielding\nthe highest rewards possible, subject to fulfilling equity goals. Public\ninvestments have a habit of crowding out private investments in many\ninstances, so the government need become involved only when gaps\nappear, and even then it is sometimes possible to intervene only\nminimally. A case in point is agricultural research. Governments, ar-\nguably, are no better than the private sector in undertaking such\nresearch. However, the government does have an important role in\nensuring all producers, including smallholders, contribute towards\nfunding such research. The free-rider problem can easily be overcome\nby making use of the existing export tax collection service to levy funds\nfrom producers. It would appear that more expenditure on agricultural\nresearch would yield a very high return, although perhaps more so for\nsome products (particularly coffee, coconuts and cocoa) than others.",

What has been shown is that a much\nhigher retum could be generated from current levels of expenditure in\nthese areas simply by reallocating some public funds towards more\nelementary schooling and health care services. Care is needed, how-\never, in the implementation of schemes to deliver these services to\ntural areas. Ultimately it is the quality of the services provided that\nmatters, not simply the amount of money spent.\n\nGiven the rugged terrain, long coastline and low population density of\nPapua New Guinea, transport costs necessarily loom large. For that\nreason investment in transport infrastructure and regulation of markets\nfor transport services are important determinants of (especially rural)\npeople’s productivity and real incomes. Expanding substantially the\nroad and port networks apparently is not economically justified in the\nforeseeable future, but further investments in maintaining and improv-\ning selected existing facilities may well be. And the numerous policies\naimed at regulating air and coastal shipping services might well be\nreconsidered since, even if the free market outcome is seen to be less\nthan ideal, it may be preferable to the regulated alternative.\n\nFinally, on the role of government, the quality of policy analysis suffers\nfrom a dearth of statistical information. The return from investing more\ngovernment resources in the collecting and timely publishing of addi-\ntional basic data on the economy is probably extremely high.\n\nPriority areas for further research\n\nThis study is very much a broad brush view of the implications for\nagriculture of Papua New Guinea’s economic growth, structural chan-\nges and economic policies. In skimming the surface of numerous\nissues, it raised implicitly many more questions than it answered. Even\nif it does no more than stimulate further policy analysis, however, the\nStudy will have achieved its purpose. With that in mind, an appropriate\nway to conclude is to suggest some of the areas which might be given\nhigh priority by subsequent researchers.\n\nOne pressing import need is an analysis of alternative tax structures.\nThe heavy reliance on import trade taxes and the smallness of the\ncontributions of company taxes, of government revenue from mining,\nand of personal taxes from the vast majority of the population are\ncause for concern. Would the replacement of the plethora of import\nrestrictions with a uniform relatively low export tax improve the efficien-\ncy and equity of taxes on trade? Is there scope for raising more\ncompany tax revenue, particularly from mining? The resource alloca-\ntive and income distributional implications of alternative tax structures",

The economic theory of the effects of\nbooming sectors is now well developed. Also, the experiences of many\nother economies which enjoyed mining booms have now been\nanalysed, so that comparisons between theirs and Papua New\nGuinea’s experiences would be possible.' One would hope that such\ncomparisons could shed more light on why so little of the gain from\nmineral export growth in Papua New Guinea has filtered through to the\npopulation at large.\n\nLand tenure is a critical issue in agriculture. Given the sensitivity of the\nissue of alienating customary land, there is a need to explore various\nalternatives to alienation that are more in keeping with traditional\nvalues and yet can give greater security of tenure to land users.\n\nAs an aid to selecting investment priorities, continuing empirical re-\nsearch is required which can illuminate the investment areas of highest\nreturns within the major spending categories of the government's\nbudget. The evidence presented above suggests there would be sub-\nstantial scope for redirecting spending within the education, health and\nagricultural research/extension categories, but more careful ex ante\nempirical analyses are required to improve those suggestions, and to\nbe able to rank priorities better across categories.\n\nAt present there are no systematic empirical estimates of the effective\nrates of assistance/taxation afforded the different sectors by govern-\nment policies in Papua New Guinea.
