What is the role of an in-service conscientious objector program in an all-\nvolunteer force?

The paper will address these fundamental issues and\nconclude that while the in-service conscientious objector program serves an important\nfunction, like the 1960’s model car designed and built for the needs of its time, the in-\nservice conscientious objector program must be overhauled to meet the demands of the\n\nvastly different world it faces today.\n\n° H.R. 5060, 102d Cong., 2d Sess.

HISTORY OF THE IN-SERVICE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR\n\nThe current policy toward in-service conscientious objectors is the latest\nexpression of a national tradition to exempt from compulsory military service citizens\nwho, because of their religious beliefs, conscientiously oppose military service. The\nhistory of the in-service conscientious objector, as contrasted with the conscientious\nobjector to compelled or conscripted service, is relatively short. Nevertheless, even\nthough the in-service conscientious objector program is recent, it shares the heritage of\nthe larger and far older tradition of accommodating conscientious objectors to\ncompulsory military service. Reviewing the history of this tradition serves two purposes\nin this paper. This history demonstrates the development of the nation's policy of\naccommodating conscientious objection to compelled military service. This history also\ndemonstrates the limitations Congress consistently sought to impose on any exemption\nfrom compulsory military service based on conscientious objections.\n\nThe colonial period saw mixed responses by the individual colonies to the\nconscientious objector. Some colonies excused objectors from compulsory service in the\nmilitias, while other colonies forced conscientious objectors to choose between fidelity to\ntheir religious beliefs and heavy taxes, fines, or even prison.’ Early in the American\nRevolution the Continental Congress adopted a resolution recognizing and respecting\nconscientious objections to compulsory service in the state militias when such objections\n\narose from religious beliefs. This resolution, however, also encouraged these\n\n” SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM, SPECIAL MONOGRAPH NO. 11, VOL. I,\nCONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION 29 (1950) [hereinafter MONOGRAPH]; STEPHEN M.

Individual states had ennacted\nconscientious objection exemptions to compulsory service in the militias that, at least\narguably, did not require a religious basis to qualify for the exemption.’ The national\ngovernment, however, had not addressed the matter since the Revolutionary War, during\nwhich it had addressed only conscientious objections based on religious principles.\n\nAfter several years of unsatisfactory experience with draft laws that made no\nprovision for Quakers and others having conscientious objections to military service,\nCongress passed a new draft act in 1864 containing an exemption for conscientious\n\nobjectors.*° This exemption was limited to only those members of religious\n\n® The full text of the July 18, 1775 resolution read as follows:\n\nAs there are some people who from Religious Principles cannot bear arms\nin any case, this Congress intends no Violence to their Consciences, but\nearnestly recommends it to them to Contribute Liberally, in this time of\nnational calamity, to the relief of their distressed Brethren in the several\nColonies, and to do all other services to their oppressed country, which\nthey can consistently with their Religious Principles.\n\nMONOGRAPH, supra note 7, at 33-34.\n\n° The Maryland constitutional convention of July 1776 passed a resolution directing\nthe convention committees to consider distinguishing between conscientious objectors\nwho fail to enroll in the militia because of religiously based conscientious objections and\nthose whose objections were based on other motives. Before the Civil War, the states of\nPennsylvania, Alabama, Texas, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, and Indiana adopted\nconscientious objector exemptions from compulsory militia service in their state\nconstitutions. These exemptions did not specify that the conscientious objections must\nbe religiously based. Jd. at 37, 39-40.\n\n© Act of Feb. 24, 1864, ch. XIII, § 17, 13 Stat. 9 (1864).\n6",

Therefore conscientious objectors were\nsubject to the draft, but served in noncombatant roles only.”\n\nThe Confederate Congress also made provision in its conscription policies for the\nreligious conscientious objector. Beginning in April 1862, the Confederate Congress\nassumed authority over the military draft and, later that same year, provided an\nexemption which lasted for the duration of the war for members of named pacifist\ndenominations, provided that such persons furnished substitutes or paid a tax.’\nAccordingly, both sides in the Civil War granted exemptions from compulsory service for\nconscientious objectors whose religions forbad them from participating in combat.\n\nCongress again authorized a draft to support the United States. effort in World\n\nWar I and, as it did with the Civil War draft laws, authorized a noncombatant\n\n1.

The military services may approve an application for conscientious objector\nstatus for any soldier:\n\n(1) Who is conscientiously opposed to participation\n\nin war in any form;\n\n(2) Whose opposition is based on religious training\n\nand beliefs; and\n\n(3) Whose position is sincere and deeply held.**\n\nThe first criterion comes directly from the statutory definition of conscientious objection\nand has been enforced rigorously by courts reviewing conscientious objection cases.*?\nThe second and third criteria, however, have been influenced heavily by judicial\ninterpretation of the draft law conscientious objector exemption.\n\nThe second criterion, like the first, comes directly from the statutory definition of\n\nconscientious objection, but the Supreme Court has adopted an expansive interpretation\n\n37 50 U.S.C.

Justifications for Continuing an In-Service Conscientious Objector\n\nProgram in the Volunteer Force.\n\nAs the history of the in-service conscientious objector program demonstrated,\nCongress has repeatedly expressed its conviction that those whose religious beliefs\npreclude them from engaging in military service ought to be exempt from compulsory\nmilitary service.

Soldiers who harbor\ndeeply held, conscientious objections to military service will tend to have difficulty\nserving successfully and may hurt the morale of other soldiers in the unit. Furthermore,\ndevoting the military’s training efforts and resources to those soldiers who are most able\nto contribute to the military mission simply makes sense.\n\nThese considerations favoring a conscientious objector program are present even\nin a volunteer force.

Professor Kent Greenawalt, in a detailed analysis of selective\nconscientious objection, identified the principle arguments against an exemption for\nconscientious objectors as follows:\n\nA) It is unjust to excuse selected individuals from a general obligation,\n\nparticularly one which exposes those not excused to danger or significant\n\nhardship.\n\n77 Id.; Lempke interview, supra note 75.\n\n8 Telephone interview with Captain Flora D.

Consequences of an Overinclusive Standard\n\nThe overinclusive standard for \"religious training and belief” developed in Seeger\nand Welsh resulted in four sets of adverse consequences. First, the Seeger-Welsh\nstandard gives the irrational result that a standard which requires religious beliefs may\nnot distinguish between secular and religious beliefs. Second, the Seeger-Welsh standard\nin several ways fosters unfairness or the perception of injustice in the administration of\nthe in-service conscientious objector program.

Finally, what amounts to a standardless standard poses several practical\ndifficulties to the military as it administers the in-service conscientious objector program.\n\na. The Irrational Outcome Consequence\n\nThe Court in Seeger and Welsh took a statutory standard that required religious\nbelief and converted it to a standard that forbids the government from distinguishing\nbetween religious and secular beliefs in the area of ethics, philosophy, and personal\nmoral codes. One commentator concluded, \"Now the conscientious objector exemption\n\nmight be forbidden only to the lukewarm and opportune.

Justice Black stated that a claimant's own characterization of his\nbeliefs as “nonreligious” was a “highly unreliable guide” to the factfinder.*** Under\nnormal circumstances, one would consider the claimant to be the most competent to\nidentify his belief system as religious or not.

Although the in-service conscientious objector program requires\nreligious belief as a prerequisite to eligibility, as in Gillette, this alone does not violate\nthe Establishment Clause prohibition.

Commentators criticized the conscientious objector exemption\nadministered by the Selective Service during the Vietnam War era as \"unreliable.””**\nThese writers pointed to several factors that led to a lack of uniformity, accuracy, and\nfairness in implementing the exemption. Measuring the current program against the\nproblem areas identified from the Selective Service experience reveals that many of the\nsame problems affect the current in-service program.\n\nThe very nature of an inquiry into a claim of conscientious objector status\nrequires a rigorous approach. Investigating an individual's personal religious beliefs and\nvalue system is a complicated, personal, and abstract matter.?°? Such an inquiry requires\nsensitivity, as well as familiarity with the applicable standards and a willingness to pursue\ninconsistencies or ambiguities in the claimant’s information.\n\nOne criticism of the Selective Service program was that the local draft boards\nexamining conscientious objector claims had no special experience or expertise in\n\ninvestigating such matters.*®° Furthermore, because of the small number of\n\n289 See supra notes 58-62 and accompanying text.\n\n281 Field, supra note 163, at 889.\n282 See supra note 177.\n283 Rabin, supra note 174, at 1017-18; Field, supra note 163, at 894.\n\n88",

This is a\nparticularly disabling circumstance in the often complicated and always very personal\nmatter of investigating the sincerity of deeply held beliefs.\n\nBeing able to draw upon some measure of expertise is particularly important in\ninvestigating conscientious objector cases because these cases involve two persons--the\ninvestigating officer on the one hand and the claimant on the other--with fundamentally\n\nconflicting views on the morality of their continued participation in the military.

This would enable the investigating officer to benefit from\nexperience as he or she investigates cases and develops practical expertise that he or she\ncan pass along to the replacement officer.\n\nThe designated investigating officer should be a judge advocate. Appointing a\njudge advocate would take advantage of professional education and experience in\nstatutory and regulatory interpretation, evidence analysis, and other skills uniquely useful\nin investigating conscientious objector cases.\n\nBecause of this professional education and experience, a judge advocate, moreso\nthan a line officer, will be familiar with interpreting and applying complex regulatory\nguidance.

The current policy\nwas shaped, in part, by external forces and national interests that no longer exist. Like a\nused '71 model in a '93 automobile showroom, this product of another time, shaped by\nthe demands of that time, does not meet the needs of the \"buyers\" it seeks to serve. In\nthis case, the “buyers” are the nation and the nation's military. These “buyers” are not\nwell served by a program designed to meet the needs of an army drawn in large part\nfrom conscripted manpower. These “buyers” are not well served by a program shaped in\n\n97",

The in-\nservice conscientious objector program must be restructured to meet the needs of the\n\nnation and its military as they exist today.\n\nA. Necessity for an In-service Conscientious Objector Program\n\nAn in-service conscientious objector program serves three enduring purposes,\neven in an all-volunteer military. Recognizing and excusing religious conscientious\nobjectors from military service continues a long national tradition rising from a national\ncommitment to religious freedom, individual liberty, and democratic pluralism.\nProviding an in-service conscientious objector program also recognizes the reality that\ncoercing military service from a person whose deeply held religious beliefs forbid such\nservice will seldom make a good soldier. Finally, an in-service conscientious objector\nprogram acknowledges the reality that people grow and change throughout their lives.\nThese changes can include changes in a soldier's fundamental belief systems that can, in\nturn, lead to conflict with that soldier's continued military service. For these reasons,\nthe Department of Defense ought to continue a program to accommodate the needs of\n\nthe in-service conscientious objector.\nB. Necessity for Change in the Current Program\nThe current in-service conscientious objector program serves a need, but also\n\ncarries within it several fundamental flaws. The program is burdened with standards\n\n98",
    "Page_105": "and procedures that proved difficult to implement during the draft era and that have not\nimproved with age.\n\nThe current program was designed at a time when the military relied upon the\ndraft as a significant source of its manpower; when the Cold War mission dictated\nmilitary policy; and when the military was growing to meet the demands of that mission.\nThe current program incorporated judicial standards from litigation involving the\nSelective Service conscientious objector exemption. These standards were not mandated\nby the Constitution; were inconsistent with congressional intent in the Selective Service\nAct; and failed to consider the differences between an in-service conscientious objector\nprogram and a conscientious objector program for inductees.\n\nThese overinclusive judicial standards proved difficult to apply during the\nVietnam War era and continue to cause the same kinds of problems today. The process\nthe military uses to investigate conscientious objector claims proved unwieldy and\nyielded inconsistent results during the Vietnam War era and continues to cause the same\nkinds of problems today.\n\nWhile the flaws in the in-service conscientious objector program remain, the\nmilitary it serves has undergone fundamental change and continues to change in\nresponse to a very different set of national security missions from those of the 1960s.\nThe role of a conscientious objector program in an all-volunteer force is different in\nsubtle ways from the role of a similar program in a force manned to a significant degree\n\n306\n\nby conscripts.” The potential impacts of an overbroad conscientious objector program\n\n396 See supra part V.A.2.b.\n99",

Finally, the third objective for any\nchanges to the in-service conscientious objector policy must be an accommodation of the\nfundamental changes in the military that the policy serves. The changes this thesis\n\nrecommends flow from and are designed to achieve these three objectives.\n\nD. Benefits of the Proposed Changes\n\nThis thesis proposes three changes to the current in-service conscientious objector\nprogram.\n\nThe first of these changes narrows the scope of the policy--that is the effect of\nnarrowing the definition of “religious training and belief” that qualifies a soldier for\nconscientious objector status. Narrowing this definition is consistent with Congress's\nintent in the conscientious objector provision in the Selective Service Act and follows the\nnational tradition of exempting religious objectors from military service. The proposed\ndefinition more closely reflects Americans’ sense of religion and equity in excusing\ncertain persons from military service. The proposed definition also meets constitutional\nstandards.\n\nThis definition avoids the potential for greater readiness problems from a vague\nand broad exemption. This is particularly important should the nation ever again\nbecome involved in an unpopular war. The proposed definition also restores greater\nobjectivity to the factfinder's mission in adjudicating a claim of conscientious objection.\nThis greater objectivity will promote accuracy, uniformity, and fairness in the program.\n\nThe second recommended change improves the quality of the investigative\nprocess used in adjudicating conscientious objector claims. Using designated judge\n\n103",
    "Page_110": "—\n\nadvocates from corps or corps-equivalent staff judge advocate offices to investigate\napplications for conscientious objector status will ensure a certain level of professional\nexpertise and generate a well of experience in investigating these cases. Requiring\ndirected interviews of commanders, colleagues, and family members will ensure a\ncommon baseline of information. Combined, these changes will provide a greater\ndegree of uniformity, accuracy, and fairness than the program currently experiences.\n\nThe final recommended change requires alternative service of conscientious\nobjectors who incurred service obligations as a result of funded graduate or professional\neducation or training. This requirement would bring greater fairness to the program by\nrecognizing the needs of the conscientious objector, as well as the obligation owed the\nnation because of the benefit the objector received. Requiring alternative service in\nthese circumstances also would deter the insincere from seeking conscientious objector\nstatus as a ticket back to civilian life with a military-funded education or professional\ntraining.\n\nThe in-service conscientious objector program continues to serve a purpose in\nthe volunteer military. The changes recommended in this thesis will ensure that the\nprogram will serve the military and the nation effectively, fairly, and with the least\nimpact on military readiness. Now is the time to trade in the ‘71 model--limited as it is\nby the demands and limitations of its day--for a ’93 model, free of the defects of the\n\nearlier model and designed to meet today’s requirements.\n\n104"
