    "Page_2": "Abstract\n\nThe development of heart valve stenosis and sclerosis can lead to the development of\nfatal complications such as congestive heart failure. Therefore, severe valve stenosis\nrequires a surgical operation with artificial heart valve replacement. Given that the\ngeometrical differences between artificial valves would significantly influence\nhemodynamic performance around the implanted valve, additional knowledge for the\ninteractions between blood flow and the artificial valve is necessary. Therefore, in order\nto proceed, this study proposes an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nsimulation using a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) technique to investigate artificial valve\n\nleaflet motion under different physiological conditions.\n\nAmong various FSI technique, it is proposed to simulate the motion of the artificial heart\nvalve with a fully-coupled algorithm and arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation\n(ALE) using a monolithic solver. Models are constructed using a realistic aortic root for\nboth the bileaflet and bioprosthetic valves with additional modifications and\nconsiderations for the flexible arterial wall. Normal physiological blood pressure and\nconditions are used to simulate healthy scenarios, which are compared with experiments.\nValidation is conducted by analysing particle image velocimetry (PIV) experimental data\nfrom ViVitro Lab. Hemodynamic performance analyses are conducted and found that\nboth velocity and maximum von Mises stress are higher if calculated using a rigid wall\nmodel. The leaflet dynamics, on the other hand, is relatively the same for rigid or flexible\nwall model. Clinically relevant scenarios are also simulated for both mechanical and\nbioprosthetic valves. The clinical focus for the mechanical valve is on the malfunction of\nthe valve due to leaflet restrictions. In addition, the clinical focus for the bioprosthetic\nvalve is on the systolic deficiency due to different tissue properties.\n\nil",

Since the contraction of left ventricle would produce greatest blood\npressure in order to send the blood into ascending aorta through aortic valve, it would be\nthe primary selection to investigate aortic heart valve hemodynamic and valve\nperformance. There are usually three leaflet cusps that made up of aortic valve: the left\nand right coronary cusps and the non-coronary cusp.

    "Page_18": "1.1.2 Types of Artificial Heart Valve\n\nThere are multiple approved products for artificial heart valves due to different design\nphilosophies, including maximizing durability or performance, or minimalizing damage\ndone to blood tissue. The following three sub sections are going to discuss briefly on\nartificial valves based on three main categories.\n\n1.1.2.1 The Mechanical Valve\n\nSince the first ball and cage mechanical valve was successfully replaced the aortic valve\naffected by aortic stenosis performed by Dr. Harken in 1960, the development of artificial\nheart valve has accelerated due to the invention of the heart-lung bypass machine and\ncreated more than 70 different prosthetic valves'?!, An artificial mechanical valve is\ntypically comprised of three main parts: a suturing ring for securing the artificial valve to\nannulus, a set of valve leaflet for preventing reversed blood flow, and a control\nmechanism for controlling the motion of the valve leaflet, such as shown in Figure 1.3.\nBesides the early design of ball and cage mechanical valve, there are two major types of\nvalve introduced into market: tilting disk mechanical valve and bileaflet mechanical\n\nvalve,\n\nSince the mechanical heart valves have superior life expediency and the risk for structure\nfailure, the mechanical heart valve remained one of the selections for valve replacements\n'SI4I5]_ However, several regions of mechanical heart valve are known to have stagnant\nblood flow that may be the site that originated thrombosis. This is the primary reason for\npatients receiving artificial mechanical valve to take anticoagulation medications for the\nrest of their life!!!\" Moreover, hinge mechanisms of the mechanical heart valve have\nalso been investigated and found to be prone for thrombosis and may require further\nimprovements; therefore, the development of an artificial heart valve that could mimics\nthe native heart valve without the increase of thrombogenic risk is considered as an\nalternative approach!*!\"\"),",
    "Page_19": "[8]\n\nFigure 1.3 Commercially Available Bileaflet Mechanical Heart Valve\n\n1.1.2.2 The Bioprosthetic Valve\n\nAs the desired approach is to replace the diseased valve with one that mimics the native\nvalve, a Ross procedure could be performed using autograft pulmonary valve in order to\nreplace the diseased aortic valve and followed by another allograft procedure to replace\nthe transplanted pulmonary valve. Although it is concluded that the Ross procedure has a\nlow risk for thrombosis and endocarditis while maintaining a high survival rate, the\nnecessity of reoperation limits the technique to younger patients'®!. A bioprosthetic aortic\nvalve, as one of the alternative, is usually constructed with animal pericardium and\ndeveloped for superior hemodynamic, such as shown in Figure 1.4. Due to the same\ntrileaflet geometry from native aortic valve for the bioprosthetic aortic valve, the\nimprovements in hemodynamic performance could be simply depended on minor design\nmodifications of the commissure between each model.

In order to verify and validate the numerical experiments conducted using the\ncomputational scheme discussed in Chapter Two, both literature review and PIV\nexperimental data comparison against different computational models are conducted.\nMoreover, the primary results for bileaflet mechanical valve focus on the hemodynamics\nand shear stress around aortic valve and aortic root geometry, specifically the flow\nvelocity distribution for valve performance and maximum shear stress for blood damage.\nThe secondary results focus on the overall leaflet dynamics regarding the leaflet position\nin one complete cardiac cycle for bileaflet mechanical valve and the maximum von Mises\nstress distributed within the valve leaflet. Furthermore, clinical applications and\nevaluations regarding to mechanical valve leaflet malfunction are going to be discussed.\n\n44",
    "Page_59": "3.1 Rigid Wall Bileaflet Mechanical Valve\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to construct CFD models with the use of FSI\nmethod in order to evaluate both the hemodynamics and the structural dynamics of the\nartificial heart valves. The presented results in this section are going to focus on the\nsimulated result for bileaflet mechanical valve with rigid wall assumption. In order to\ndiscuss the results processed from the simulated models, verification of the models is\nfirstly discussed, followed by the hemodynamics of the blood flow around mechanical\nvalve, and the structure dynamics of mechanical valve leaflet.\n\n3.1.1 Verification and Validation\n\nWith the results for rigid wall mechanical valve presented and discussed above, the\nverification and validation can be discussed by comparing the average velocity at the\noutlet and average downstream velocity. In order to confirm the accuracy and correctness\nof the constructed models, a study on mesh convergence is firstly conducted. Given that\nthe model is solved using finite element method, a proper mesh size should be established\nin order to ensure solution is mesh configuration independent for accurate results. Briefly\ndiscussed in the method section, since the computational domain is in 2D and mesh is\ngenerated using triangular elements for general domain and rectangular elements for\nboundary layer, the configuration of different mesh is by adjusting the element growth\nrate and element size.\n\nTable 3.1 Summary of Mesh Configuration for Rigid Wall Mechanical Valve\n\n“MeshConfig.

Notice that the minimum and maximum mesh qualities remain relatively\nsimilar such that any fluctuation due to mesh quality between different mesh\nconfigurations could be minimalized. In order to study the effect on solution accuracy of\ndifferent mesh configurations, the average existing velocity in x-direction is calculated\nfor each configuration, shown in Figure 3.1.\n\nThe average U velocity profile for different configurations at outlet are plotted in time\nwith the profiles clearly showing that solution would be independent after the extra fine\nmesh configuration, while the coarse, fine, and finer mesh configurations would have a\nvarying average outlet velocity due to the increase of mesh elements. Given that the\ndifference between extra fine mesh and extremely fine mesh in average velocity is well\nbelow 5% during the peak-opening phase and 10% during the end-opening phase, due to\nthe delay on valve closure, it is decided that the selected mesh configuration would be\nconfigured with the extra fine mesh due to mesh independence and computational\n\nconsumptions.\n\n46",

Noticeable throughout Figure 3.2(a) to (c), the central velocity jet has\na relatively higher difference than the two side jets.

During peak systole\nat 0.15 s, the maximum peak to peak velocity difference is roughly 15.6% around the\ncentral jet while the two side jets have a maximum velocity difference of 1.7%.\n\nThis difference may be caused by several experimental factors such as the frictional force\nwithin mechanical valve joints, the use of realistic ventricle for applying inlet flow, or the\nvertical tilting of the experimental apparatus for artificial valve. In addition to\n\n49",
    "Page_64": "experimental factors, the measurement conducted by PIV would also affect the result due\nto equipment resolution, laser reflection near the wall and the usage of glycerin-water\nmixture; therefore, the estimated uncertainty from PIV experiments is roughly 5% to 10%.\nMoreover, the experiment is controlling volumetric flow rate and targeted cardiac output\nsuch that the information on pressure gradient across the valve is measured, which is the\nprimary boundary condition for computational model. Also, additional difference can be\nfound at the center of the domain due to the result of no-slip boundary condition applied\nto the surface of valve leaflet.\n\nIn addition to temporal velocity difference, Figure 3.3(a) to Figure3.3(c) has showed that\nthe velocity profiles are in good agreements for numerical simulation and PIV experiment.\nThe velocity profiles at various downstream locations within computational domain are\nplotted in Figure 3.3 during peak systole at 0.15 s.

The\nidentification of different cardiac phases is done relatively to the valve leaflet dynamics,\nwhich could easily be separated logically, in order to compare different simulated models.\nThe defined cardiac phases for one cardiac cycle are differentiated as the initial-opening\nphase (the end-closing phase), the peak opening phase, the end- opening phase (the initial-\nclosing phase), and the mid-closing phase. These different phases can be identified and\nrelated to the simulated time by referring to the boundary pressure profile shown in\nFigure 3.4: the initial-opening phase defined by the occurrence of equilibrium pressure\nacross the valve at 0.15 s, the peak-opening phase defined by the occurrence of minimum\npressure gradient after initial opening phase at 0.23 s, the end-opening phase defined by\n\n52",

    "Page_69": "To briefly discuss the results presented in Figure 3.5, the initial opening phase with the\nisolated time frame of 0.15 s is firstly reviewed. Given that the pressure starts with a\nnegative gradient at time zero, a steady leakage flow, due to the intervalvular space\nbetween valve leaflets at fully closed position, is successfully captured when reached to\nthe initial-opening phase. At 0.15 s, where the pressure gradient is approximately zero,\nthe backward flow velocity slowly reaches to zero and creates a central vortex behind the\nintervalvular space, shown by the concentrated streamline in Figure 3.5(a). Vortices are\ngenerated at the ventricular portion of the computational domain due to leakage jet. Since\nthe flow around the initial-opening phase is at minimum, the area of high shear stress is\nconcentrated near the boundary around the area where the leakage jets exist.\n\nAt the peak-opening phase, with time advanced to 0.23 s, where the pressure gradient\nreached to a minimum, the flow velocity reaches to a maximum with a velocity\nmagnitude of 1.176 m/s. Given that the computational domain has a realistic aortic root\ngeometry implemented, the result successfully reproduces the recirculation of blood flow\nwithin the aortic root, as it would be expected in native aortic valve to avoid particles\ndeposition. As for the distribution of shear stress, a layer with higher shear stress is\nshown to be around the mechanical valve leaflet due to maximum forwarding blood flow.\nFurthermore, at the peak-opening phase, the valve leaflet reaches to a maximum opening\nposition of 85 degree and maintains at maximum opening until the end of opening phase.\n\nAt the end-opening phase, with time advanced to 0.38 s, the mechanical valve leaflets are\nfully closed and generated a temporary peak backward flow from the mechanical valve\nleaflet closing. Due to the rapid change in flow direction, the distribution and the\nmagnitude of shear stress around the artificial valve are expected to be increased to a\nmuch higher value than for previous time frames, as the shear stress contour plot\nidentified. Interestingly, the velocity contour plot shows that high velocity magnitude\nonly occurs near the intervalvular space at both end of mechanical valve leaflets while the\nhigh shear stress occur near the boundary of blood vessel wall due to the reverse flow.\n\n55",
    "Page_70": "Nevertheless, with time advanced to 0.8 s, the mid-closing phase of the cardiac cycle has\nrevealed a near-zero velocity magnitude for the blood flow at the aortic side, especially\nwithin the realistic aortic root. Due to the narrow intervalvular space and a negative high\npressure gradient across the valve, the leakage blood flow has a continuous high velocity\nmagnitude, which greatly affects the distribution of shear stress. Moreover, the central\nleakage blood flow, located between the two leaflets at the center of the bileaflet\nmechanical valve, is found to have a transition oscillatory behavior under high velocity.\nRegarding the shear stress distribution during mid-closing phase, the shear stress contour\nhas revealed a significant decrease in magnitude compare against the end-opening phase.\nIn addition, the high shear stress distributed near the vessel wall on the aortic side during\nthe end-opening phase has decreased to a near-zero magnitude, which suggests that the\nhigh wall shear stress would be temporary due to sudden valve closure. However, the\nshear stress near the end of mechanical valve leaflets remain as high as 4,000 dPa, which\nsuggests a high possibility of thrombosis occurrence.\n\nTo analyse quantitatively the hemodynamics, the velocity across the diameter of the\naortic root could be plotted in order to investigate the downstream velocity distribution.\nThe selection of the exact position for the evaluation of cross sectional velocity is\ndetermined based on the maximum wall-to-wall distance within the aortic root, which\ncould be approximated at 9 mm downstream from the base of aortic root. Therefore, the\noverall cross sectional velocity could be calculated and the velocity within aortic root\ncould also be fully captured. Shown in Figure 3.6, the velocity distribution at 9 mm\ndownstream is plotted with the vertical axis reflecting the y-position of the aortic root and\nthe horizontal axis reflecting the x component of the velocity vector while the center line\nof the aorta is marked in order to clearly identify the center of flow. As one may expected,\nthe velocity for the initial-opening phase at 0.15 s has an approximated small reversed\nvalue of —0.05 m/s due to the leakage flow from the beginning of cardiac cycle. For the\npeak- opening phase at 0.23 s, an approximated peak velocity of 0.95 m/s has found near\nthe outer side of the two mechanical valve leaflets with a smaller velocity profile of\n0.7 m/s between the leaflets due to the intervalvular space of the mechanical valve.\n\n56",

For the end-opening phase at 0.38 s, a peak reverse velocity\n\nwith an approximated value of —0.73 m/s near the center of the flow is found. Since the\n\nflow characteristic at the end-opening phase would be a total reverse flow, the velocity\n\nprofile shown in the figure has confirmed that all velocities across the cross sectional\n\nplane are negative.

    "Page_73": "3.1.3 Mechanical Valve Leaflet Dynamics\n\nSince the motion of the artificial heart valve leaflet is closely related to the performance\nof the artificial valve, the second set of processed results from FSI models are the\ndetermination of structure dynamics for mechanical valve leaflets throughout one cardiac\ncycle. As mentioned in the Method section, given that the computational domain is\nconstructed with a geometrical symmetry, the physical constraints for the mechanical\nvalve leaflet are defined separately in order to capture any asynchronous behavior that\nmight be caused by the possible occurrence of transition flow during peak systole. There\nis, however, one limitation for the activation of physical constrain on valve leaflets. Since\nthe method is to activate the constraints when the current angular position is beyond\nlimitation, an overshoot in leaflet position could be observed due to the time lag in\n\nconstrain activation.\n\nWith the time history for mechanical valve leaflet motion during one cardiac cycle\nplotted in Figure 3.8, the leaflet dynamics can be closely investigated and discussed. As\nthe initial-opening phase starts at 0.15 s when the pressure gradient across the\nmechanical valve is approximately equal to zero, the forward flow increase rapidly due to\nthe sudden increase in pressure gradient from 0.15 s to 0.23 s. Given this rapid ejection\nperiod of 80 ms, the valve leaflets are able to reach to maximum opening position at\n0.23 s from the fully closed position at 0.15 s. The valve leaflets are then maintained at\nfully opened position for approximately 110 ms from 0.23 s until an approximated time\nof 0.34 s. The valve leaflets are then reached to a fully closed position when the time\nreached to 0.38 s due to large negative pressure difference across the valve forcing the\nleaflet to be closed rapidly for a closing period of 40 ms.\n\n59",

In addition to general leaflet dynamics, Figure\n3.9 shows two region of interest that reveals leaflet instability during cardiac cycle. The\ninstability for the period when valve leaflets maintain at fully opened position, shown in\nFigure 3.9(a), occur after the peak-opening phase of 0.23 s as the leaflet position\nconstraints are activated once the leaflet reached the maximum opening angle of 85\ndegree. Since the blood flow during the maximum leaflet opening period would be the\nmaximum throughout the whole cardiac cycle, the instability is most likely caused by the\nflow entering transition region due to high central velocity jets, shown in Figure 3.6 at\n0.23 s, around mechanical valve leaflet. It is noted that the instability during peak-\nopening phase could only be reproduced under an additional refined mesh configuration.\nThis further suggests that small scale vortices due to transitional flow could be captured\n\n60",
    "Page_75": "under finer mesh grids; therefore, in order to capture vortices in all scale, a DNS model\nwill be necessary. On the other hand, the instability around the end-opening phase shown\nin Figure 3.9(b) have a different cause since the flow velocity is lower right after the\nclosure of valve leaflets at 0.38 s. Since physical constraints are applied instantaneously\nwhenever the leaflet positions pass beyond the constrained angles in order to limit the\nminimum and maximum leaflet position, a large counter moment is applied to the valve\nleaflets such that the constrained boundaries at the joints of valve leaflet receive a large\nreaction force. Therefore the leaflets are modeled as striking against hard surface and\nresulting in leaflet rebounds, such as shown in Figure 3.9(b). As mentioned previously,\nthis method does not require any additional geometrical complexities; however, the\nmethod introduces a small time lag in order to determine the precise time to activate\ncounter moment. The delay of counter moment activation could be observed in both\nFigure 3.9(a) and (b) at the time when leaflets reach either maximum or minimum\nangular position. To address the concern of constrain activation delay in this study,\nseveral control parameters are properly adjusted in order to reduce the artifact of position\n\novershoot within an absolute maximum difference of 0.1 degree.\n\nIn addition to leaflet position in time, the stress within valve leaflets can also be\ncalculated based on simulated results. Figure 3.10 shows the maximum von Mises stress\nwithin two mechanical valve leaflets over one cardiac cycle on a semi-log plot. It is\nclearly shown that a peak stress of approximately 100 MPa is generated at the time when\nleaflets are firstly closed; while the maximum stress for other time periods are\napproximately below 10 MPa. Since the yield strength of mechanical valve leaflet, which\nis commonly be constructed with pyrolytic carbon, is approximately 400 MPa; it may be\nsuggested that based on the result shown in Figure 3.10 the valve leaflets are not likely to\nfail by yielding. Also notice that the stresses within valve leaflet change according to the\nleaflet instability shown in Figure 3.9(a) during leaflet opening phase.\n\n61",

Since blood vessel would be distorted during systole and\ndiastole with the possibility of wall oscillations, making the assumption of rigid blood\nvessel may result in insufficient accuracy comparing with natural blood flow. Therefore,\nthe addition of flexible wall model is introduced in order to estimate the difference\nbetween rigid wall model and flexible wall. Similar to previous section, the\nhemodynamics of the blood flow would be firstly discussed and followed by the structure\n\nmechanics of valve leaflets and model comparison.\n\n3.2.1 Blood Flow Hemodynamics\n\nWith the identical pressure boundary profiles, shown in Figure 3.4, applied to flexible\nwall model, the results can also be isolated in the same time frames used in rigid wall\nmodel, shown in Figure 3.11, where Figure 3.11 (a) to (d) are velocity contours and\nFigure 3.11 (e) to (h) are shear stress contours.\n\nStarting with the initial-opening phase at 0.15 s, due to the expansion of arterial wall at\nthe aortic portion, the leakage jets from intervalvular space have a higher velocity\nmagnitude compare with rigid wall model. The vortices generated by leakage jets are\nrelatively symmetric and are clearly visible at the ventricular portion behind the valve\nleaflets. Since the expansion of the vessel wall enlarges the overall volume of backflow, a\nhigher maximum velocity magnitude is presented at this phase with a value of 1.916 m/s,\ncompare against with the rigid wall model. Moreover, the shear stress distribution of the\ncomputation, shown by shear stress contour plot, also presents a higher maximum shear\nstress of 1619.6 dPa, which is higher than the critical value for blood cell damage.\n\n63",
    "Page_78": "During the peak-opening phase at 0.23 s, further expansion of arterial wall is presented\nwith a maximum flow velocity passing through valve leaflets due to the increase of\npressure gradient across mechanical valve. The recirculation of blood flow within\nrealistic aortic root during peak systole is also presented as shown in the rigid wall model.\nThe maximum velocity magnitude is shown to be less than the rigid wall model, which\nimplies that the expansion of arterial wall acts as a flow damper to smooth the high\nvelocity generated by high pressure gradient. The high shear stress distribution during\nthis phase is generally concentrated along valve leaflet surfaces and arterial wall;\nhowever, since flow during this phase is smooth without blockage of valve leaflets, the\nmaximum shear stress is much lower than other phases with a value of 691 dPa.\n\nAt 0.38 s during the end-opening phase, valve leaflets are closed and resulting in leakage\njet formations from intervalvular space. A maximum velocity magnitude with a value\nof 4.112 m/s is generated from leakage jets, which is much lower than the result\nprocessed from rigid wall model. The addition of the elastic arterial wall might be one of\nthe factors for the velocity reduction since the expansion of the wall potentially allow\nhigher pressure difference and damp down the velocity magnitude. As for the shear stress\nresults, comparing with the rigid wall model, a lower shear stress is presented around\nvalve leaflets with a value of 3485.5 dPa; however, the distribution of shear stress is\n\nrelatively similar to rigid wall model.\n\nFinally, the leakage jets are stabilized with vortices generated behind valve leaflet at the\nventricle portion during the mid-closing phase at 0.8 s.

The distribution of the shear stress is similar to the\nprevious phase with a decrease of high shear stress near arterial wall; however, unlike the\nrigid wall model where the shear stress magnitude is decreased from the end-opening\nphase, the shear stress magnitude remains relatively similar from the end-opening phase\nwith a value of 3516.4 dPa.\n\n64",

At 0.15 s, in\nFigure 3.16(a) during the initial opening period, both models have a velocity profile with\na small value between 0 m/s to —0.1 m/s with minor velocity difference in between.

The central\nvelocity jet between valve leaflets for flexible wall model has a decreased width and a\ndecreased velocity magnitude by 0.3m/s to 0.45 m/s; therefore, the velocity\ndistribution is increased on the other side of the leaflets.

Clinical Application\n\nSince there are two different bileaflet mechanical valve models introduced, with the\nflexible wall model modified from rigid wall model, a systematic comparison between\ntwo similar models has been conducted in order to investigate the significance of making\nrigid wall assumption. Furthermore, with the computational models on bileaflet\nmechanical valve fully described, the secondary objective of the study is to investigate\nclinical applications using the constructed CFD FSI models.\n\nAlthough the bileaflet mechanical heart valve is known for its outstanding durability,\nthere are some major clinically complications such as valve leaflet malfunctions, which\nwould require surgical reoperation depending on the severity of each scenario. Among\nseveral different causes that lead to different severities in the decrease of hemodynamic\nperformance for artificial heart valve due to leaflet malfunction, a total valve leaflet\nrestriction caused by pannus formation after operation might leads to series of long term\ncomplication.

With the increase of tissue stiffness, aortic sclerosis due to\nvalve leaflet calcification can be simulated. Since the models presented previously are\nsimulating a healthy tissue valve with a tissue stiffness that is representing a general\nupper limit of approximately 2 MPa, any increase of stiffness above the limit would\npotentially leads to some degree of aortic sclerosis or stenosis.\n\nWith the healthy leaflet stiffness of 2 MPa as baseline comparison, four additional leaflet\nstiffness configurations are investigated. Since most parameters in biological system have\nlarge variant, the additional stiffness configurations are segregated proportionally to\nbe 4 MPa, 5 MPa, 10 MPa, and 20 MPa in order to characterize minor, moderate, and\nseverer sclerosis. The results for average velocity at 0.23 s with all five configurations\nare shown in Figure 4.11 using the modified model with rigid wall assumption.

The maximum velocity, as\nexpected, are slightly higher for the minor, with leaflet stiffness of 4 MPa and5 MPa,\nand moderate sclerosis, with leaflet stiffness of 10 MPa. The maximum velocity for the\nseverer sclerosis, however, is lower than the healthy configuration. This difference in\nmaximum velocity is caused by the change in flow ejection width that is directly related\nto leaflet stiffness. Comparison for the ejection width can be done between each severity\nagainst the healthy model, which has a width of 15 mm, the minor, moderate, and severer\nsclerosis has a width of 12.5 mm, 10.5 mm, and 9.2 mm, respectively.

Based on the\ncalculated velocity profile and shear stress distribution, the tissue valve indeed has a\nbetter hemodynamic performance than the bileaflet mechanical valve model presented in\nChapter 3. Given the result presented for systolic period, the shear stress along the wall\nboundary is smaller than the critical value before blood cell damage; however, due to the\ncomputational restrictions, results during diastolic period cannot be calculated. In\naddition to the healthy models presented, investigations regarding the change in tissue\nproperties are also conducted. It can be concluded that the increase in tissue stiffness\nwould decrease hemodynamic performance dramatically as aortic sclerosis would lead to\naortic stenosis. Moreover, the stiffening of arterial wall would suppress the generation of\nvortices by suppressing the oscillatory behavior of leaflet motion, which may lead to the\ndecrease in blood recirculation and particle deposition. In addition, the stiffening of valve\nleaflet would lead to early valve closure and decrease valve performance.

Also, velocity field and\nvortices formation from the simulated result may provide suggestions on artificial\nvalve damage or flow regurgitation.\n\n96",
    "Page_111": "5.4 Model Constraints and Limitations\nThere are several key limitations regarding the computational models presented in this\nstudy listed as follows:\n\ne Imposed zero initial condition introduces additional transition\n\ne Frictionless joint for mechanical valve provides a free rotational pivot\n\ne Blood properties are assumed to be Newtonian without considering shear thinning\nbehavior\n\ne Automatic re-mesh, required by large deformation, introduces additional\ninterpolation\n\ne Aortic wall properties are assumed to be isotropic elastic without considering\nviscoelastic behavior\n\ne Computational domain requires to maintain continuous\n\ne Curvatures of aortic root and tissue valve may not reflect all cases\n\n5.9 Future Work\nThere are some additional improvements and applications that can be done to the current\nmodel, such as model improvement, design optimization, and patient-specific application.\n\nIn order to improve the current model, it is possible to eliminate several limitations\ndiscussed in precious section. For example, it is possible to extend the simulated time\nfrom one cardiac cycle to multiple cardiac cycles such that the effects from initial\nconditions could be minimalized. Also, the pivots for mechanical valve leaflet are\nconstrained with applied moment when maximum and minimum leaflet angles are\nreached; an additional formulation can be integrated into the equation in order to account\nfor frictional force. In addition, the topography for tissue valve can be parameterized such\nthat the model can represent various types of valve. Nevertheless, the existing tissue\nvalve model can easily be modified to investigate hemodynamics of transcatheter valve.\nFinally, the model can be transformed into 3D such at the solution along three axis can be\ncalculated.\n\n97",
    "Page_112": "As the models presented in this study fully coupled the fluid and structure domain, a\ndesign optimization can be conducted. As most physical parameters are known or can be\ncalculated as the result of FSI model, the structure of the artificial valve can be improved\nby redesigning the leaflet curvatures such that the flow resistance during valve opening\ncan be minimalized. In addition, stress distribution within artificial valve leaflets can be\nused for the investigation of fatigue and fracture analysis.\n\nNevertheless, with the newly introduced transcatheter valve available as another surgical\noption, several clinically related cases for transcatheter valve can be investigated.\nSpecifically, there are needs for improving the understanding of intervalvular leakage\nbetween the native or the implanted valve and the transcatheter valve. In addition, the\nselection guideline on valve size for transcatheter valve is yet to be determined.\n\n98",
