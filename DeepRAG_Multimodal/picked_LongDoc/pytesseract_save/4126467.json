Flood hazard is\ndefined as potential damage by water having sufficient depth or velocity to damage\nimprovements or to deposit or scour soil other than within channels.\n\nEach improvement shall be designed so as to not increase the rate of flow of\nwater onto adjacent properties. An exception to this may be permitted by the Director if\nthere are adequate downstream facilities provided to handle the total flow without\nadverse affect on other properties. In this event, the Developer may be required to\nparticipate in the cost of said facilities and/or obtain easements or other rights as\nneeded.\n\nUnless an individual project required diversion of water to conform to a\ncomprehensive drainage plan, water shall be received and discharged at the locations\nthat existed prior to development and as nearly as possible in the manner that existed\nprior to development Should diversion be required, sufficient work shall be done\nupstream and/or downstream to provide all affected properties at least the same level of\nflood protection as existed prior to the diversion.\n\n-50-",

Most design details are left to the responsibility of the Consultant, subject to\napproval by the Director, and may be handled by following good engineering practice.\n\nThe design standards contained herein are minimal and altemates may be\napproved, provided such altemates are to a higher standard than those set forth.\nExceptions to these standards may be allowed by the Director when it can be\ndetermined that such exceptions are in the best interest of the City.\n\nAll drainage facilities shall be maintained by the City, a homeowner's association\nor an approved maintenance district. The Developer shall complete arrangements for\nmaintenance prior to filing of the final subdivision or parcel map.\n\nAll drainage facilities for new construction or redevelopment of individual\nproperties not in an approved maintenance district or homeowner's association must\ncomply with the City of Grover Beach Standards for Individual Lot Runoff and be\n\n \n\nmaintained by the owner and retained on site. See section 5.06, G. and Standard\nDrawings D.11 through D.14.\n\n5.02 | ALIGNMENT AND CAPACITY:\nA.

This allows a backflow of water into the cylinder,\nresulting in severe cylinder corrosion and escape of chlorine gas.) The preferred\nequipment for applying liquid chlorine is a solution-feed, vacuun-operated chlorinator\nand a booster pump. The vacuun+operated chlorinator mixes the chlorine gas in\nsolution water; the booster pump injects the chlorine-gas solution into the main to be\ndisinfected.

Leaks or breaks that are\nrepaired with clamping devices while the mains remain full of pressurized water present\nlitte danger of contamination and require no disinfection.\n\nTrench Treatment - When an existing main is opened, either by accident or by\ndesign, the excavation will likely be wet and may be badly contaminated from nearby\nsewers. Liberal quantities of hypochlorite applied to open trench areas will lessen the\ndanger from such pollution. Tablets have the advantage in such a situation because\nthey dissolve slowly and continue to release hypochlorite as water is pumped from the\nexcavation.\n\nSwabbing With Hypochlorite Solution - The interior of all pipe and fittings\n(particularly couplings and sleeves) used in making the repair or connection shall be\nswabbed or sprayed with a 1% hypochlorite solution before they are installed.\n\nFlushing - Thorough flushing is the most practical means of removing\ncontamination introduced during repairs or connections. If valve and hydrant locations\npermit, flushing toward the work location from both directions is recommended.\nFlushing shall be started as soon as the repairs are completed and shall be continued\nuntil discolored water is eliminated.\n\nSlug Chlorination - When practical, in addition to the procedures above, the\nsection of main in which the break or connection is located shall be isolated, all service\nconnections shut off, and the section flushed and chlorinated as specified herein except\nthat the dose may be increased to as much as 300 mg/L and the contact time reduced\nto as litte as 15 min.
