The COVID-19 pandemic has\nhad an impact globally over the past year, testing our\nability at all levels to manage the well-being of our\nemployees and the communities around us. We are\ngratified by the responsible actions of all those across\nour organization and the seamless alignment in\nadjusting to rapid changes in the working ecosystem.\nWe have continued to create value for stakeholders\nacross our value chain despite these challenges.\n\nEnsuring Health and Safety during COVID\n\nOur employees’ well-being has always been a key\ndriver in our sustainability efforts. We focused first and\nforemost on ensuring their safety while maintaining\nbusiness continuity and actively supporting our\ncommunities as they adapted to the pressures of the\nCOVID-19.We quickly mobilized our efforts worldwide\nby creating a Global Emergency Management Team\n(GEMT) and empowered our local leadership to ensure\nemployee safety and oversee preventive measures\nat our sites, including increased health and security\nprotocols and proper protection and sanitation.\nWe acted swiftly in following and implementing\nthe guidelines and regulatory requirements of local\nauthorities and adopted the necessary workplace\ncontrols.\n\nAs some countries face second and third waves,\nor localized outbreaks, we continue to remain\nvigilant and ready to respond as circumstances change.\nOur head office and subsidiaries contributed a\ncombination of monetary donations, medical\nequipment, medicines, PPE and hygiene and food\nproducts to employees, hospitals, institutes and\ncommunity groups. Our commitment to being a\nresponsible industry leader remains stronger than ever\nin these challenging times.\n\nBusiness Resilience and Portfolio Expansion\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create\nglobal supply chain disruptions, we remain steadfast in\nour values and see change as an opportunity.\nOur continued efforts in sustainability, particularly in\nareas of innovation and strong stakeholder\nrelationships with our industry partners has enabled\nus to be operationally resilient throughout this crisis.\nOur significant investment in recycling businesses\ndemonstrates the growth of our recycling portfolio\nresulting in minimal environmental impact.\n\nIn line with our strategy, in January 2020 we acquired\nHuntsman’s world-class integrated oxides and\nderivatives businesses. With a cash value of US$2\nbillion, this represents the largest and most ambitious\nacquisition ever by IVL. It strengthens our R&D,\ntechnical capabilities, international footprint through\na flagship site on the US Gulf Coast, Chocolate Bayou\nand Dayton in Texas, Ankleshwar in India and Botany\nin Australia. By combining IVL and Huntsman’s\nexperience, our access to market, technical and\nintellectual properties, we will also lower corporate\noverheads and consolidate supply chain and\nprocurement, boosting EBITDA contribution by\nUS$40 million by 2021.\n\nSustainable Finance\n\nWe continue to successfully secure financing for our\nsustainability-linked initiatives. In 2020, we received\ntwo significant environmental, social and governance\n(ESG) linked loans, of which the commercial terms\nare linked to improvements in IVL’s ESG performance.\nWe successfully completed Thailand's first ever\ncross-border Sustainability-Linked Ninja Loan worth\nUS$225 million from 16 Japan-based banks and\ninstitutions. This is structured in response to our\nsustainability performance, and interest is adjusted\nbased on our ESG score.

This includes\nensuring that we work to minimize energy intensity\nand GHG emissions, despite continuing to grow.\nOne critical area is responsible water management.\nWe seek to reduce the use of energy and freshwater\nin our operations and remain focused on our 2025\nambition.\n\nIVL joined the 50 Climate Leaders campaign in 2020,\nwhich includes the Task Force on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) and the United Nations\nGlobal Compact (UNGC) among others, to showcase\nour collective work as part of the international\nbusiness community and to demonstrate our\nleadership and determination in taking effective\naction against climate change.\n\nFocusing on our Full Potential\n\nAs a leadership team, we have come together as\none voice on our transformation - to which we are\nall committed. We remain focused on incorporating\nall levers of value creation and will ensure that our\nportfolio is integrated and responsibly serves the end\nuse of consumers’demands while keeping in mind the\nimportance and commitment to the circular economy.\n\nIn 2020, we continued our progress in implementing\nour Leadership Curriculum program targeted\nat empowering leaders within all levels of our\norganization with the necessary skills and tools\nto ensure a sustainable business performance.\nIn 2020, a mix of e-learning, virtual training, and\nin-person training were deployed globally. A total of\n200 leaders completed the Leadership training program\nand approximately 1,000 leaders were trained via\ne-learning in the fundamentals of IVL Leadership Skills.\nWe also customized the Mentoring Program for junior\nand middle management participants, while Executive\nCoaching was initiated with two leaders to support\ntargeted leadership development.

We are beginning\ntoseea culture of sustainability taking shape across the\norganization and a mindset that helps strike a balance\nbetween economic goals and responsibility towards\nour planet for the coming generations.\n\nThis year, the pandemic has forced the world to pause\nand reflect on our resource heavy consumption and\nbehaviors. However, we are seeing increased awareness\nas consumers are demanding concrete actions for\na sustainable future, and all stakeholders including\ncorporates, communities, policymakers, research\ninstitutes and universities among others, are\nconverging ona common objective - sustainable living.\n\nContributing to a cleaner future\n\nIt is encouraging to see that some corporates are\nproactively setting internal sustainability targets\nahead of regulatory compliance requirements. Besides\nindividual actions, collaborative alliances are emerging\nwhich help drive awareness and build momentum to\nachieving targets within timelines. At IVL, we have set\nour targets to reduce GHG emissions by 10%, reduce\nwater consumption by 10%, reduction in energy use\nby 5%, and increase renewable electricity use\nby 10% (of our overall energy consumption) by 2025.\nWe are also pursuing setting up Science Based Targets\n(SBTs). We continuously look for new tools and\ntechnologies which can be embraced by our businesses,\nto help standardize our business processes, approach\ncarbon neutrality, and optimize resource use with\nminimal impact to the environment.\n\nStrengthening recycling partnerships\n\nWe believe that a collaborative approach can have\na wider impact and are therefore working closely\nwith industry associations such as NAPCOR, the\nEllen MacArthur Foundation, as well as recycling\ncollaborations with our key customers. We are also\nworking with several technology providers, our\nfeedstock suppliers and customers to continuously\nimprove the quality of our products and services\nincluding advanced recycling solutions. We remain\nfocused on developing an all-inclusive circular economy\nin part by educating students, teachers, communities\nand other enablers to positively influence consumer\nbehavior in support of a circular economy ecosystem.\n\nOur commitment to recycling since the start of 2011\nreached an important milestone in March of 2020 as\nwe recycled our 50 billionth PET bottle. We further\npledged to invest US$1.5 billion to increase our\nrecycling capacity to 750,000 tons of post-consumer\nbottles and 50 billion bottles per year by 2025.\n\nPioneering green finance\n\nFinancial institutions and investors are increasingly\nviewing corporations through a sustainability lens\nwhile investing, approving, and extending financial\nsupport. We have secured approximately US$1 billion\nin sustainability linked loans from various banks and\nfinancial institutions, and a portion of these funds\nare considered \"Blue Loan\" to address plastic waste.\nSustainability linked loans are tied to a company’s ESG\nrating, while improvements in ESG ratings enable more\nsustainable finance at favorable lending terms.We have\nmore sustainability linked loans in the pipeline from\nvarious banks and financial institutions.\n\nSustainability Report 2020",

This year, we created 16\napplication-focused and fully empowered businesses\nin three segments. And in order to help them in their\ngrowth, we created six enabling functions namely,\nSustainability, Environment, Health and Safety,\nIndorama Ventures Excellence, Digital, Business\nContinuity and Communications, which are directed\nby experienced professionals identified within the\norganization and recruited from the industry. We are\nseparately investing in the necessary IT infrastructure\nto provide the standardized data and capabilities\nrequired of a future ready organization.\n\nFor continuous improvements, the enabling functions\nand business units continue to create a pipeline of\nideas to improve the efficiency and effectiveness\nof the enterprise.

We accelerated our digital journey\nin the past few years and have used digital tools at\nvarious sites to improve our efficiency and effectiveness.\nTo promote a digital culture across the organization,\nthis year, we established a digital academy to provide\ntraining on various digital tools and also organized\ndigital conferences and created digital lighthouses.\nThe digital team is collaborating with other enabling\nfunctions in addressing capability gaps and aligning\ntheir KPls with business KPls to target a common goal\nof digitization at all levels in the organization.\n\nEnvironment, Health and Safety\n\nWe continue to attach our highest importance to\nenvironment, health and safety. We have created a\ncentral EHS enabling function with responsibility\nto standardize policies and common guidelines on\n\nenvironmental impacts, the safety of employees and\n\nResponsible and Effective\n\nDriving Sustainable Towards\nGovernance Growth\n\nassets and to ensure business continuity. The EHS\nteam’s KPls are closely aligned with the businesses.\nAn enterprise-wide EHS specialized management\nsoftware was introduced for the smooth and\nseamless flow of data across the organization and\nto take necessary actions at the right time. The EHS\nfunction is bringing synergies with other enabling\nfunctions, particularly with the Sustainability and\nBusiness Continuity functions, as both are helping\nthe organization in achieving its sustainability goals\nthrough a culture of continuous improvements.\n\nIndorama Ventures Excellence\n\nWe have been deploying various tools and continuous\nimprovement processes over the years and decided\nto embrace the Indorama Ventures Excellence (IVEX)\nprogram across the organization. The IVEX team, in\ncollaboration with the Digital team, has identified\nopportunities which will help the businesses improve\nprocess efficiencies along with resource optimization.\nTo ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of\nsolutions, ensuring they do not diminish over time\ndue to the dynamic nature of the enterprise, IVEX aims to\nsustain positive change by creating a culture backed by\nintensive training and skills enhancements through a\ncontinuous increase in the number of green belts, black\nbelts and master black belts across the organization.\n\n \n\nCarbon Neutrality\n\nEmpowering Our People Global Performance\nand Communities Data\n\nWe see the convergence of enabling functions as a\nsingle body and are working together with business\nunits to identify any gaps and find appropriate and\nsustainable solutions. The primary purpose of the\nenabling functions is to build an ecosystem to\nsustain a culture focused on continuous improvements\nthroughout the organization. Positive outcomes and\nachievements depend on the success of the respective\nbusiness units, therefore, the alignment of KPIs with\nbusiness units is imperative. We are shaping up the\nenabling functions, keeping in mind the short-term\nand long-term targets of the business units.\n\nOn the sustainability front, we believe in collaborating\nwith other like-minded industry players to leverage\ntechnologies and experience in carbon neutrality,\nclean energy and positive impacts on the environment.\nThe sustainable values resulting from IVL's initiatives\nand actions are a reflection of our ongoing efforts in\nsupport of the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n(UN SDGs) and the UN Global Compact principles.\nWe are also working on evolving our EHS, CSR and\nSustainability functions into a broader Environmental,\nSocial and Governance initiative.

Our existing facilities\nsuccessfully recycled over 222,288 tons of post-\nconsumer PET bottles equivalent to 10.1 billion\nbottles throughout 2020 and we are well on target\nto achieve our 2025 ambitions.\n\nIndorama Ventures PCL.\nVision - To be a world-class sustainable chemical company making great products for socie!\n\nChief Strategy Officer\nMessage Message\n\nChief Sustainability Officer IVL's Sustainable\nCESS Te} Value Creation for Stakeholders\n\nWe are members of industry associations such as\nNAPCOR, Petcore Europe, Ellen MacArthur, GPAP and\nthe Recycling Partnership to promote PET and recycling.\nWe formed partnerships with organizations including\nLess Plastic Thailand, working with them to make\nPPE suits for medical personnel, and the Trash Lucky\ninitiative, which encourages disadvantaged communities\n\nto learn about the benefits of recycling.\n\nLast November, | took part in the World Bank’s\n“Marine Plastics in East Asia and the Pacific: Crisis\nand Opportunity” event detailing our recycling\ncommitment and sustainable business focus as part of\nthe solution to this pressing development challenge\nin the region. | specified that our commercial success\nis tied to environmental responsibility, that there is\na market for sustainability and that consumers want\nsustainable packaging - and confirmed we are\nleading on this front. We are honored to receive the\nfirst blue loan from IFC. This drives improvements\nin waste collection systems, meaning less waste\nand cleaner oceans by recycling post-consumer\nPET bottles into new bottles. In this way, we give\n\nwaste an economic value.\n\nSustainable Organization Growth\n\nWe have been able to sustainably run our global\nbusinesses despite the pandemic. Our new Integrated\nOxides and Derivatives (IOD) business acquisition\nand Fibers portfolio strengthens our businesses and\nprovides diversification and integration along the\nentire value chain. IVL makes products that meet daily\nconsumer needs and that are resilient to external threats.\nIt is crucial that we continue to work together and\n\nfocus on driving sustained innovations and successes.\n\nIn addition, Wellman International, our subsidiary,\njoined forces with the HealthGuard® Corporation\nto develop a range of antiviral, antimicrobial and\nantibacterial polyester staple fibers which mitigate\n\nthe transmission of COVID-19. We are, therefore,\n\nResponsible and Effective\n\nDriving Sustainable Towards\nGovernance Growth\n\nlooking to find potential sustainable solutions in this\nand other areas with a longer payback horizon and\n\nwhich offer even more potential.\n\nWe closely monitor the sourcing and use of chemicals\nand other substances necessary in our operations.\nWe comply with the European Chemicals Agency\n(ECHA)’s list of substances of very high concern (SVHC)\nand continue to seek solutions that avoid using\nchemicals on the SIN (Substitute It Now!) list. In 2020,\nwe replaced cobalt acetate color control with toners in\nour Auriga facility product portfolio in South Carolina,\nUSA, thus enabling us to provide our customers with a\nmore cost-efficient product while ensuring the safety\nof end consumers. As a result, our product safety\nmanagement has helped us achieve the second with\naB grade in ChemScore’s ranking of the world’s largest\n\nchemical companies in 2020.\n\nCommitting to A Sustainable Future\n\nOur commitment to sustainability remains steadfast\nthrough the global pandemic. Adopting and\nintegrating the UN SDGs and guiding principles of the\nUN Global Compact (UNGC) into our sustainability\nstrategy will ensure we operate responsibly and\nwith a sustainability mindset. To further advance our\nposition, we became a “Participant” member of the\nUNGC, demonstrating our commitment to advancing\nethical business practices across our value chain to\npromote human and labor rights, environmental\nprotection, and anti-corruption. We are committed\ntowards implementing the ten principles of the\nUNGC and are in the process of producing our first\n\nCommunication on Progress report by June 2021.\n\nWe continue to be recognized by organizations such as\nDJSlas well as MSCl and improved our position last year\nwith our top-ranked inclusion in the FTSE4Good index.\nReceiving the Gold recognition, we were recognized\nas one of the top 2% of companies in the manufacture\n\nof basic chemicals from EcoVadis underscoring the\n\nCarbon Neutrality\n\nEmpowering Our People Global Performance\nand Communities Data\n\nresults of our combined efforts. We also received a\nsuite of prestigious awards such as the Best Polymer\nProducers Awards for Europe 2020 in the PET category\nand the Sustainable Business Awards, Thailand —\na testament to how we are pushing the envelope on\n\nsustainability and innovation.\n\nAs COVID-19 continues to impact the world, we are\nreminded of the ongoing risks and vulnerabilities.\nIt is, therefore, crucial for us to remain vigilant and\nprepared. The well-being of our employees, customers,\nsuppliers and communities will continue to be at\nthe forefront of our fight against the pandemic.\nWe continue to monitor the COVID-19 infection rates\nacross our operations and remain hopeful that as\nvaccinations progress, we can ensure the safety of our\n\nkey stakeholder groups.\n\nWe are thankful for the time and effort being put\nin by the IVL team and all our partners even during\nthis unprecedented period, as we demonstrate\nour capacity for change and continue to pursue\nour ambitious efforts in making sustainability front\n\nand center in what we do.\n\nYash Lohia\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nSustainability Report 2020\n\nGRI Standards\nContent Index",

Both proactive and responsive,\nsustainability reporting represents one of many\nengagement channels with our stakeholders, allowing\nus to proactively summarize sustainability-related\nperformance, outline key initiatives and highlight\nfuture plans, as well as respond to issues raised\nand faced globally. By adhering to recognized and\nconsistent frameworks, sustainability reporting offers\nreaders information that is comparable across years and\nsectors and in relation to other global organizations\nsimilar to IVL. We also ensure that our information\nis assured by independent auditors.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI\nStandards: Core option. It has also been prepared with\nclose reference to other international criterion such as\nthe International Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework,\nUN SDGs, UNGC principles and AA1000 Assurance\n\nScope of Reporting\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2020 contains information\ndeemed of material value to our business and\nstakeholders, i.e., issues that have the potential to affect\nour ability to create value in the short, medium\nand long term. These issues are discussed and tested\nwith our diverse stakeholder groups and are\ndisclosed within our reporting boundary. The <IR>\nFramework requires that we explain our organizational\noverview, our approach to governance, our business\nmodel, the risks and opportunities that we face, our\nperformance and our future outlook.\n\nIndorama Ventures PCL.\n\nVision - To be a world-class sustainable chemical company making great products for societ\n\nThe Report combines the major financial and\nsustainability-related information necessary to\nthoroughly evaluate our performance; we selected\nthe report’s topics based on the GRI Reporting\nPrinciples for defining report content and quality.\nIn addition to our report, we publish further information\nonline. Links to this supplementary information are\nprovided in the relevant sections.\n\nStandard. The information in this report also serves\nas a Communication on Progress report on IVL's\nimplementation of the 10 principles of the UNGC which\ncomprises into 4 themes: Human Rights, Labours,\nEnvironment and Anti-Corruption.\n\nAs we mark the tenth year of sustainability reporting\nin 2020, we decided to enhance our sustainability\nreporting and further strengthen our internal\nESG-related communications by structuring our report\naround key content elements of the International\nIntegrated Reporting Council (IIRC)’s International\nIntegrated Reporting <IR> Framework. This Report\ncombines the necessary environmental, social,\ngovernance and financial information from across IVL\nand our subsidiaries to enable stakeholders to build a\nclear sense of the value that we create or transfer over\ntime. The <IR> approach organizes this value creation\ndisclosure into broad ‘capitals’ (Financial, Manufactured,\nIntellectual, Human, Social and Relationship and\nNatural).\n\nFor this report we have consolidated information from\nacross 107 operating sites in 33 countries in which we\nare present, for our global operations, subsidiaries\nand factories (see ‘Exceptions’ below for any entities\nnot included). Information relates to activities occurring\nbetween January 1 2020 and December 31 2020,\nunless otherwise stated, for example newly acquired\nentities are reported upon from acquisition date.\nIn some cases, we also refer to organization and\nglobal events that took place after December 31 2020\nif deemed as important context.\n\nFor those entities in which IVL represents more than\n50% ownership and for joint ventures in which we have\nmanagement control, we report consolidated data.\nWe exclude data from entities in which we participate\nvia minority ownership, and those in which we have no\nmanagement control. Our quantitative environmental\ndata is gathered from meter readings, production\nsystem outputs, detailed accounting models, and where\nnecessary via estimations with ground rules.\n\nFurther details of our reporting boundaries can be\nfound within the GRI Content Index on pg. 142-148.\n\nPrevious Sustainability Reports can be accessed via\nthe link below:\nhttps://sustainability.indoramaventures.com/en/\ndownloads/sustainability-reports\n\nDue to a number of energy-intensity acquisitions in\n2020, our global business grew and our environmental\nfootprint changed. In order to ensure clear progress\nand communication towards our 2025 targets we reset\nthe baseline to 2020. For further information on this\nbaseline, refer to our Sustainability Ambitions section\non pg. 24.\n\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Accounting\n\nWe follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol on Corporate\nAccounting and Reporting as outlined by the World\nResources Institute (WRI) and the World Business\nCouncil for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).\n\nReporting Principles\n\nValue Creation\n\nAs a world-class global and integrated business, we\nexist to create value. Our business model - underpinned\nby robust governance, clear purpose and a defined\nstrategy, represents the core through which we\ntransform our resources (capitals) into valuable\noutcomes and outputs for our diverse stakeholder\ngroups. Articulating IVL’s value creation process\nmeans linking decision-making at the highest\nlevels to performance and future targets,\nproviding insights into our operations and supply\nchains and making commitments to ensure our\n\nlong-term success.\n\nReport Content\n\nSustainability reporting is not a mere annual data-\ngathering exercises designed to fulfil external demand\nor tick boxes. Rather, the reports represent the output\nfrom ongoing and integrated information flows within\nand across IVL and its stakeholders that are critical to\nthe long-term success of the organization. By actively\nengaging with our stakeholders on issues of most\ninterest to them means we are able to:\n\nIn alignment with these standards, our GHG accounting\nfor 2019-2020 was implemented systematically and\nconsolidated across all our global operations.\n\ne Allocate expertise, resources and time to those\nsustainability issues deemed most critical in\nenabling our ability to create long term value for\nour stakeholders.\n\ne Test our strategic intentions against important\nsocial, environmental and economic issues and\nscenarios and adapt our approach where necessary\nas a result.\n\ne Identify opportunities for innovation, growth and\nnew business initiatives and maintain a competitive\nadvantage by integrating sustainability in our\nday-to-day operations.\n\ne Ensure early sight of potential risks or threats to\nour license to operate.\n\nDeciding which issues are of most interest to readers\nof the Sustainability Report 2020 means ensuring that\nthroughout the year, processes, feedback channels\nand communications platforms consolidate within\na structured ‘materiality’ process in which issues are\nassessed, measured, rated and mapped according to\nformal principles and frameworks.\n\nSustainability Report 2020 ue",

Prepared\nwith close reference to guiding principles rather than\nspecific indicators, our Sustainability Report 2020\ncombines qualitative and quantitative information\nthat aligns to current measurement and performance\nframeworks required and valued by our stakeholders.\nUsing the <IR> approach enables us to clearly highlight\ninterdependencies within our businesses and the\nexternal environment, show how we allocate resources\nacross the capitals, and demonstrate how we build\nlong-term sustainability.\n\nThe GRI standards provide organizations with principles\nfor producing comprehensive, quality communications\nfocused on being balanced, comparable, accurate,\ntimely, clear and reliable. In the preparation of\nthis report we consolidated opinions from our varied\nstakeholder groups to build a robust set of material\nissues. To apply the GRI standards on defining report\ncontent in our Sustainability Report 2020, we adhere\nto the following three steps:\n\n1. Sustainability Context:\n\nThis Sustainability Report 2020 provides readers with\ndetailed insight into how IVL and our subsidiaries\ncreate and deliver short, medium and long-term value.\nIt outlines how we identify our sustainability-linked\nmaterial topics, identify external trends, formulate our\nstrategy, how we govern the implementation of that\nstrategy, and our considered approach to managing\nrisk and seeking new opportunities. We strongly believe\nthat being a responsible operator and going beyond\nminimum requirements in the environmental, social\nand governance spheres makes good business sense.\nA business can only be sustainable and deliver benefits\nif it is to work actively in relation to and with respect\nfor such factors.\n\n2. Materiality Assessment:\n\nIn 2020, we undertook our materiality assessment\nanalysis by including feedback from engagements\nwith internal stakeholders across all our operations,\nbusinesses and core functions, as well as key external\nstakeholder groups, including customers, suppliers,\nbankers, fund providers/managers, investors and\nconsultants. We also focused on topics of significance\nthat relate to economic, governance, environmental\nand social areas of the business and ensured that\ndiscussions were framed in terms of the potential\nimpact that these issues may have on IVL's ability to\ncreate long term value.\n\nIndorama Ventures PCL.\n\nVision - To be a world-class sustainable chemical company making great products for societ\n\nChief Strategy Officer\nMessage Message\n\nChief Sustainability Officer IVL’s Sustainable\n\nMessage Value Creation for Stakeholders\n\nWe mapped the issues raised within a materiality matrix.\nThis matrix was assessed by business leaders, individual\noperations leadership representatives, a cross section\nof individuals from across IVL, external stakeholders\nand analyzed in detail by the Sustainability Team and\nreviewed by the SRMC. We also cross referenced against\nGRI topics and where relevant, assigned indicators.\nFor more information, please refer to our GRI Content\nIndex on pg. 142-151 of this report.\n\nIn 2020, 13 key material topics were identified, for which\nwe created enhanced performance indicators and\ntargets to drive internal performance improvements.\nDetails of the materiality matrix are given in the\nMateriality Assessment section of this report on\npg. 32-33 as well as on our website via the link below:\nhttps://sustainability.indoramaventures.com/en/\nour-sustainability/materiality-assessment\n\n3. Sustainability Report Assurance and GHG\nVerification:\n\nWe believe that external assurance provides credibility\n\nand enhances transparency and completeness of our\n\nreporting. We ask independent external auditors TUV\n\nIndia Private Limited to verify and assure the information\n\nprovided in our Sustainability Report 2020 is in\n\naccordance with the GRI Standards, <IR> Framework\n\nand the AA1000 Assurance Standard. An Assurance\n\nStatement issued by TUV India Private Limited is\n\navailable in the Independent Assurance Statement\nsection on pg. 134-137 of this report.\n\nThe information on GHG Scope 1, 2 and 3 [for just 1\ncategory] emissions has been verified by an independent\nexternal assurance auditor, TUV Nord CERT GmbH,\nin accordance with the GHG Protocol, ISO 14064-1,\nand ISO 14064-3.\n\nNon-financial information in this report is subject\nto some uncertainties due to limitations inherent\nin the nature of measuring such data. For example,\nmeasurement techniques and data selection criterion\ncan vary between IVL and our subsidiaries. We remain\ncommitted to reporting the most comprehensive and\naccurate metrics possible within these confines for\nour stakeholders and the public.\n\nResponsible and Effective\n\nDriving Sustainable Towards\nGovernance Growth\n\nData Methodology\n\nData Coverage\n\nIn 2020, we expanded data verification coverage\nto 107 operating sites compared to 94 sites in 2019.\nUnless otherwise stated, we report data for our\noperations on 100% ownership basis (e.g. for an 80%\nowned operation we report 100% of the data).\n\nCarbon Neutrality\n\nEmpowering Our People Global Performance\nand Communities Data\n\nInformation provided covers the company as a whole.\nData is reported using the metric system and in US$\n(dollars) unless otherwise stated.\n\nChanges in size, structure, ownership and developments\n\nThe list of entities acquired, incorporated and other developments is available in the 2020 Annual Report on\npg. 87-97 and on our website under investor-relations newsroom at:\n\nhttps://www.indoramaventures.com/en/investor-relations/newsroom/press-releases\n\nExceptions\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2020 includes environmental,\nsafety, governance and human resources data from\nall entities, including joint ventures in which we hold\na shareholding of 50% or more and have\nmanagement control.

These statements can be identified\nthrough the use of language such as ‘aim’, ‘believe’,\n‘estimate’, ‘expect’ ‘goal’ ‘intend’, ‘may; ‘plan’, ‘target’,\n‘will’ and other similar terms. Forward-looking\nstatements offer investors and other stakeholders\nimportant insight into our vision and how we believe\nour strategy sets us up for long term success.\n\nIn their nature they also include making some\nassumptions in the future business environment or\nwider which may affect our ability to deliver on our\ntargets. For example, shifts in legal and regulatory\nframeworks, national fiscal complexities which can\naffect our ability to compete effectively, unforeseen\neconomic and social challenges in the countries in\nwhich we operate etc. There is therefore a degree of\nuncertainty inherent within forward-looking\nstatements which readers are asked to accept when\nassessing the information provided therein. Investors\nare cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such\nforward-looking statements, which speak only as of the\ndate they are made.

The assurance activities were carried out together\nwith a desk review for all other IVL sites within the reporting boundary. Applicable boundaries for\ndisclosures are explained in the Report.\n\nTUVI did not perform any assurance procedures on the prospective information, such as targets,\nexpectations, and ambitions, disclosed in the Report. Consequently, TUV! draws no conclusion on the\nprospective information. During the assurance process, TUVI did not come across any limitation to the\nagreed scope of the assurance engagement. TUVI expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for\nany decision a person or entity would make based on this Assurance Statement.\n\nOur Responsibility,\n\nTUVI's responsibility in relation to this engagement was to perform a limited level of assurance and to\nexpress a conclusion based on the work performed. This engagement did not include an assessment of\nthe adequacy or the effectiveness of IVL's strategy, management of sustainability-related issues or the\nsufficiency of the Report against principles of IIRC Integrated Reporting (<IR>), GRI Standards: Core\noption, AA1000AS Version 3, and AA1000 AP (2018), other than those mentioned in the scope of the\nassurance. TUVI's responsibility regarding this verification is in accordance with the agreed scope of work\nwhich includes non-financial quantitative and qualitative information disclosed by IVL. This assurance\nengagement assumes that the data and information provided to us by IVL are complete and true.\n\nerification Methodology\n\nDuring the assurance engagement, TUVI adopted a risk-based approach, focusing on verification efforts\nwith respect to disclosures. TUVI has verified the disclosures and assessed the robustness of the\nunderlying data management system, information flows, and controls. In doing so:\n\ne TUVI examined and reviewed the documents, data, and other information made available by IVL\nfor non-financial disclosures;\n\ne  TUVI conducted interviews with key representatives, including data owners and decision-makers\nfrom different functions of IVL;\n\ne  TUVI reviewed the level of adherence to principles of \"The <IR> Framework\" and GRI standards:\nCore option.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n\nThe following are the opportunities for improvement reported to IVL. However, they are generally\nconsistent with IVL management's objectives and programs.\n\ne IVL may perform the supplier assessment as per ISO 20400;\n\ne The SBTi Target evaluation following sectoral de-carbonization approach or absolute-based\ntargets or economic approach may be performed, and current targets can be calibrated\naccordingly;\n\ne  IVL can start verifying water and carbon intensity reduction projects. As IVL has a well-defined\nwastewater treatment system at most of its sites, the projects can apply for Zero Liquid\nDischarge certification;\n\ne IVL may opt for USGBC LEED guideline for all administrative buildings and factories to reduce\nthe GHG emission\n\nOur Conclusion\n\nIn our opinion, based on the scope of this assurance engagement, the disclosures on sustainability\nperformance disclosed in the Report along with the referenced information provides a fair representation\nof the material topics and related strategies, and meets the general content and quality requirements of\nthe GRI Standards: Core option.\n\n2|Page TUVe\n\n \n\n \n\nSustainability Report 2020\n\nGRI Standards\nContent Index\n\n   \n\n135",
    "Page_69": "Disclosures: TUVI is of the opinion that the reported disclosures generally meet the GRI Standards\nreporting requirements in accordance with the \"Core\" option. IVL refers to ‘general disclosure’ to report\ncontextual information about IVL, while the ‘management approach’ is discussed to report IVL\nmanagement's approach for each material topic.\n\nUniversal Standard: |VL followed GRI 101: Reporting Principles to define report content and quality, GRI\n102: General Disclosures were followed when reporting information about an organization's profile,\nstrategy, ethics and integrity, governance, stakeholder engagement practices, and reporting process.\nFurthermore, GRI 103 was selected for management's approach on reporting information about how an\norganization manages a material topic. TUVI is of the opinion that the reported specific disclosures for\neach material topic generally meet the GRI Standards reporting requirements in accordance with the\n\"Core\" option.\n\nTopic Specific Standard: 200 series (Economic topics), 300 series (Environmental topics), and 400\nseries (Social topics); These Topic-Specific Standards were used to report information on the\norganization's impacts related to environmental and social topics. TUVI is of the opinion that the\nreported material topics and Topic-Specific Standards that IVL used to prepare its Report are\nappropriately identified and addressed.\n\nLimited Assurance Conclusion: Based on the procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our\nattention that causes us to believe that the information subject to the limited assurance engagement was\nnot prepared in all material respects. TUVI found the sustainability information to be reliable in all material\nrespects, with regards to the reporting criteria (\"Core\") of the GRI Standards.\n\nReasonable Assurance Conclusion: TUV Nord CertGmbH has verified the information on GHG Scope\n1 and 2 emissions! in accordance with the GHG Protocol, ISO 14064-1, and ISO 14064-3. Based on the\nprocedures we have performed, in our opinion, IVL reported the direct and indirect (Scope 1 and 2) GHG\nemissions as a whole.\n\nTUVI confirms that IVL has transparently reported major material information pertaining to all its six\ncapitals in line with the <IR> framework, as below\n\nFinancial Capital: Net worth, capex, investment spent, the economic value generated, gross revenue,\netc.\n\nManufactured Capital: Manufacturing facilities, number of new products launched, business verticals,\nnew and existing plants, buildings, infrastructure, etc.\n\nIntellectual Capital: Knowledge-based intangibles, including intellectual property, R&D activities,\npatents, designs registered for new product development, etc.\n\nHuman Capital: IVL's engineers, technicians, skilling and re-skilling of employees to enhance their\ncompetencies, safety performance, capabilities, experience, motivations to innovate, etc.\n\nSocial and Relationship Capital: IVL's relationship with stakeholders such as customers, business\npartners, regulators, suppliers, business partners, communities, legislators, policymakers, and benefits\nassociated with the brand and reputation, along with IVL's ability to share information to enhance well-\nbeing.\n\nNatural Capital: Sourcing responsibilities for the majority of renewable and non-renewable environmental\nresources and processes that provide goods or services. Reporting on the circular economy, emissions,\nwater consumption, waste disposal, etc.\n\nEvaluation of adherence to AA1000 AccountAbility Principles\n\nInclusivity: Stakeholder identification and engagement is carried out by IVL on a periodic basis to bring\nout key stakeholder concerns as material topics of significant stakeholders. In our view, the Report meets\nthe requirements.\n\nMateriality: The materiality assessment process has been carried out based on the requirements of the\nGRI Standards, considering topics that are internal and external to IVL’s range of businesses. The Report\n\n1 Scope 3 GHG emission is under verification process.\n\n3|Page TUVe\n\n136 | Indorama Ventures PCL.\n\nTH 1\n\nfairly brings out the aspects and topics and their respective boundaries of IVL’s diverse operations. In our\nview, the Report meets the requirements.\n\nResponsiveness: TUV1 believes that the responses to the material aspects are fairly articulated in the\nReport, i.e., disclosures on IVL’s policies and management systems, including governance. In our view,\nthe Report meets the requirements.\n\nImpact: IVL communicates its sustainability performance through regular, transparent internal and\nexternal reporting throughout the year, aligned with GRI, <IR> Framework and the CDP as part of its\npolicy framework encompassing environmental, social, ethical and other policies. IVL reports on its\nsustainability performance to its Board of Directors, who oversee and monitor the implementation and\nperformance of objectives, as well as progress against goals and targets in addressing sustainability-\nrelated issues. IVL completed the process of establishing contemporary goals and targets against which\nperformance will be monitored and disclosed periodically.\n\nTUVI expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or entity would make\nbased on this assurance statement. This assurance statement is intended for the management of IVL,\nwhich is responsible for the information provided in the Report as well as the process of collecting,\nanalyzing, and reporting the information presented in web-based and printed Reports, including website\nmaintenance and its integrity. TUVI's responsibility regarding this verification is in accordance with the\nagreed scope of work which includes non-financial quantitative and qualitative information (sustainability\nperformance) disclosed by IVL in the Report. This assurance engagement is based on the assumption that\nthe data and the information provided to TUVI by IVL are complete and true.\n\nOur Assurance Team and Independence\n\nTUVI is an independent, neutral third party providing sustainability services with qualified environmental\nand social specialists. TUVI states its independence and impartiality and confirms that there is \"no conflict\nof interest\" with regard to this assurance engagement. In the reporting year, TUVI did not work with IVL on\nany engagement that could compromise the independence or impartiality of our findings, conclusions, and\nrecommendations. TUVI was not involved in the preparation of any content or data included in the Report,\nwith the exception of this assurance statement. TUVI maintains complete impartiality towards any\nindividuals interviewed during the assurance engagement.\n\nFor and on behalf of TUV India Private Limited\n\nBotton\n\nManojkumar Borekar Date: 24-03-2021\nProject Manager and Reviewer Place: Mumbai, India\nHead - Sustainability Assurance Service Project Reference No: 8119050301\n\nwww.tuv-nord.com/in\n\nAA1000\n\nLicensed Assurance Provider\n000-138\n\n4|Page TUVe\n\n \n\n \n\nSustainability Report 2020 aa",
