    "Page_3": "Preface\n\nSince the first Heidelberg Catechism was published in 1563, it was the second most\nused book in the Reformed Churches (next to the Bible). It was written for the\neducation of children, leading them to understand the reformed dogma in almost all\naspects.\n\nThe language used in the catechism is a bit difficult for young children to understand.\nIn the early 1930's there was a decision in the Reformed Churches in South Africa to\npublish a more understandable catechism for children as young as 8 years old. The\n\"Red Book\" (Shorter Catechism with a red cover) was followed by a \"Blue Book\",\nfocused on Children between 10 and 13 years of age. These publications were only\navailable in Afrikaans.\n\nEarly in the 21st century the need for an English version became necessary. The\nCJBF (Calvin Jubileum Book Fund) of the RCSA (Reformed Churches in South\nAfrica) appointed Daléné Frey and Christine Terblans to translate and edit the\ntranslation. It is available primarily for the use in church schooling.\n\nWhy this publication? In many homes there are children of different ages and insight.\nWhen the catechism is read parallel, all children of all ages should understand. The\nsecond reason is that there are many adults whose second language is English, and\nfor many reasons they attend English services and church schooling.\n\nThere are omissions, where certain concepts are quite difficult to understand. | am\nconvinced that these omissions will not weaken the foundation necessary to built the\nfaith of the children.\n\n| had the privilege to work though many translations of the catechism in English,\nAfrikaans and Dutch. The references to Scripture is the result of comparing these\ntranslations as well as the work by Zacharias Ursinus \"Het Schatboek der\nverklaringen over de Heidelbergse Catechismus\".\n\nIt is my sincere wish that this publication will lead the Lord's children into the truths\nof the reformed theology.\n\nHennie van Wyk\nBloemhof, 2016",
