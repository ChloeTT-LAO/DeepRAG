    "Page_7": "Section 1: Executive Summary\n\nThere were a greater number of strandings reported to the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding\nScheme (SMASS) in 2018 than in any year since the project’s inception in 1992. This was\nattributable largely to increased public awareness of the scheme, although a large beaked\nwhale mortality event contributed to this increase in reports. From the 1st January to 31st\nDecember 2018, 932 reports of 937 marine animals were reported to SMASS, comprising 499\nseals, 435 cetaceans, 2 basking shark and single marine turtle. Of these, 76 cases (8.1%),\ncomprising 49 cetaceans, 27 seals were necropsied to establish a cause of death. A further\n172 (18.3%) animals, comprising 123 cetaceans, 48 seals and single basking shark were\nsampled by trained volunteers. In those cases not necropsied, advanced autolysis or carcase\naccessibility were the most common reasons precluding further examination.\n\nOf most note this period was a globally unprecedented number of beaked whale strandings\nin August, September and early October, involving mainly Cuvier’s beaked whales (Ziphius\ncavirostris) and later northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus). This UME is the\nlargest number of beaked whale strandings reported globally, and was characterised by an\nabnormal increase in incidence of strandings in Ireland, Scotland, Iceland and the Faeroes.\nPathological data was limited due to autolysis, however a summary of the work undertaken\nis detailed in a separate report.\n\nThere were five other mass stranding events (MSE), albeit 80% of these involved only two\nanimals: Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phcoena) at Fortrose, Moray and Clackmannanshire,\ntwo short beaked common dolphin MSE’s (Delphinus delphis) in Stranraer, Dumfries and\nGalloway and South Uist. The final MSE of the year involved five long-finned pilot whales on\nthe Firth of Forth in December.\n\nSeals exhibiting lesions consistent with grey seal predation continue to be reported with 67\ncases, mostly from Orkney. The majority were grey seal juveniles (weaners) (Halichoerus\ngrypus) reported in the winter months, although harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) were also\nreported, as were suspected seal attacks on harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). The\nimpact of grey seal predation on sympatric species will be investigated as an upcoming PhD\nin collaboration with SMRU, St Andrews.\n\nIn January SMASS held the first SMASS forum at Inverness Campus- a day-long series of talks\nand workshops open to the public. This was a sell-out event and, based on the positive\nfeedback, seemed to have been very well received. The volunteer network has continued to\nexpand with two courses being run in 2018; at Inverness SAC. The number of trained\nvolunteers had increased to 212 by the end of 2018. The volunteer network is proving a\nsignificant asset to SMASS, through provision of both photographic and accurate\nmorphometric data and the safe collection of tissues for genetic and toxicological analysis.\n\nStrandings continue to attract significant media attention and effort has been maintained to\nprovide strandings and case updates through social media channels. There was particular\nmedia interest in a sperm whale stranding in the Tay Estuary in March, a long-finned pilot\nwhale stranding on Mull and the beaked whale UME. In terms of seals, the rare report of a\nharp seal pup on Skye and its subsequent necropsy attracted media interest including the\nNational Geographic magazine.\n\n7|Page",
    "Page_8": "11\n\nProject overview\n\n \n\nThis work is delivered under the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Research\nProgramme, issued on 28 May 2018 by Scottish Ministers, with work running for\nbetween 8\" June 2018 and 8\" March 2020. The project is currently managed by SRUC\nand run from their Veterinary Disease Investigation Centre, Dr'ummondhill, Inverness.\nThe principal aim of the project is to provide a coordinated approach to surveillance\nof cetacean, seal, basking shark and marine turtle strandings, and to investigate major\ncauses of death of stranded animals in Scotland. Where required, efforts should be\nmade to expand and develop the established volunteer network to improve reporting\nand strandings investigations. This project therefore has the following objectives:\n\n1.2 Contract specification\n\n \n\nvi.\n\nCollate, analyse and report data for all cetacean, seal, basking shark and marine turtle\nstrandings across the Scottish coast. This will include determination of cause of death\nand surveillance of the incidence of disease where possible. It will also involve an\nongoing review of techniques used to determine the causes of death aimed at\nimproving their accuracy, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nA small number of priority species should be identified in each year of the project for\nmore in depth and targeted studies which will involve additional analysis and testing\n(e.g. age, diet, contaminant and toxin exposure and reproductive state). The number\nof individuals and species will be determined in collaboration with the steering group,\nbut it is likely to involve 20/25 individuals and primarily focus on the following species:\nharbour seals, harbour porpoise, bottlenose dolphins and minke whales.\n\nUndertake post mortem examinations on marine wildlife (e.g., cetaceans, seals,\nturtles and sharks) stranded around the Scottish coast to determine major causes of\ndeath, including by-catch, physical trauma and the incidence of disease. A wide\nspecies and geographical spread of post mortems should be achieved, and this will be\ninformed by decisions within the project steering group.\n\nIncreased efforts should be made to collect data (via the stranding network or post\nmortem) from harbour seals reported stranded around the Scottish coast to inform\ncurrent work investigating harbour seal decline in Scotland. Seals in all stages of\ndecomposition should be targeted.\n\nProvide scientific advice to the Scottish Government as necessary about major causes\nof death in stranded marine mammals, including any trends or unusual events.",
    "Page_9": "vii.\n\nviii.\n\nxi.\n\nxii.\n\nxiii.\n\nxiv.\n\nMaintain the database for all Scottish strandings which brings together accurate and\ngeo-reference data on both strandings and necropsy data.

Of these, 76 cases (8.1%),\ncomprising 49 cetaceans, 27 seals were necropsied to establish a cause of death. A further\n171 (18.3%) animals, comprising 122 cetaceans, 48 seals and single basking shark were\nsampled by trained volunteers. In those cases not necropsied, advanced autolysis or carcase\naccessibility were the most common reasons precluding further examination with 326 (34.8%)\ncases being too decomposed to allow further examination. Figure 1 presents the total number\nof strandings reported to SMASS since 2009 and shows the increase in strandings reports,\nalthough 2018 shows a significantly higher year-on-year increase compared to previous years.\nFigure 2 shows the breakdown of strandings by subclass for 2018.

There was again an increase in the number of\ncases sampled by trained volunteers, with 18.2% of the cases being sampled compared to\nonly 12.7% last year. The percentage of cases necropsied (7.7%) was however slightly lower\nthan 2017 when 10.6% of the total number of strandings were necropsied. This implies that\nthe increase in strandings was mainly driven by an increase in animals not suitable for\nnecropsy. Cases may be unsuitable for collection for a number of factors, with autolysis being\nthe most common reason. A more detailed overview of this as well as findings at necropsy\ncan be found in Section 3 of this report.\n\n2.2 Spatial maps of strandings\n\n \n\nThere were cases reported in all coastal regions, although notable clusters of strandings were\nseen around Fife and the south east, Orkney and the south west (Clyde area). In addition, a\nhigher number of strandings were observed on the Western Isles following the unusual\nmortality event of beaked whales occurring along the Atlantic coastline (more information on\nthis can be found in section 4). Recovery of carcases and obtaining data from animals stranded\nin the southwest of Scotland was largely constrained by logistical difficulties, or poor\ninformation about the stranding, whereas the cluster of non-recovered animals from the\neastern coast from Fife to Aberdeen was usually due to animal condition rather than the\ncapacity for recovery.\n\nContinued and hugely valued assistance from our trained volunteers around the coastline,\nthe Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) in Fife, and Hillswick Wildlife Sanctuary and Scottish\nNatural Heritage (SNH) in Shetland has enabled many animals suitable for necropsy to be\nrecovered, or stranding morphometrics to be recorded.",

Physical trauma attributable to\ngrey seal predation was the most common finding for both Hg (n=43) and Pv (n=12) seals.\nEight animals died as a result of entanglement, four harbour seals died due to starvation\nfollowing maternal separation, three juvenile seals died following starvation/hyperthermia,\nand six were found to have died as a result of pneumonia (either bacterial, parasitic, or of\nunknown aetiology).

Photographs would suggest that this\nwas a probable grey seal predation case. This adult female harbour porpoise was\nfound dead stranded and frozen prior to necropsy. It was in poor nutritional condition\nand pregnant with a mid-semester foetus. Of most significance was a severe diffuse\nlymphadenopathy and diffuse pulmonary lymphocytic abscessation, likely originating\nfrom a chronic infection following injury to the right pectoral fin (Figures 26 & 27).\nCultures from the bite wound produced a mixture of organisms including Neisseria\nanimaloris. This same organism was isolated in pure from the lung and lung lesion.\nThis organism has been associated with seal bites. This suggests that the original injury\nwas a seal bite and this seeded Neisseria animaloris into the fin, sub-sequentially\ndisseminating through the lymphatics and causing a sepsis. Histology was hampered\nby the freeze thaw damage. However, the presence of the bacterial colonies in the\nlung and pulmonary lymph node are highly suggestive of pre-mortem infection rather\nthan post-mortem invasion. This is a case of sepsis due to Neisseria animaloris. This\ncase and an 7 others with similar lesions attributed to the same pathogen from\nEngland and the Netherlands are the subject of a recently submitted paper.\n\n3. M254/18, 21/04/18, Crammond Island, Edinburgh. This juvenile female harbour\nporpoise was found live stranded. There was an unsuccessful refloat attempt and the\nanimal was euthanased using barbiturate. The animal was in poor nutritional\ncondition with poor blubber deposits and back muscle mass. There was no evidence\nof recent successful feeding with only a few otoliths, fish bones and a single small\ncrustacean present in the oesophagus and cardiac stomach. There was a large\npurulent lesion suggestive of a bite wound present on the right underside of the\ntailstock. There were five purulent necrotic skin lesions on the right side of the animal\nthat extended almost too full blubber depth. The liver was friable and congested. The\nlungs were purple congested and full of stable foam. The brain was congested and\n“toxic in appearance. The lesions on the tailstock and flank are suggestive of a grey\nseal attack. Bacteriology produced a mixed culture of an Aeromonas sp., Enterococcus\nsp. and Streptococcus phocae from various sites including the bite wound lesions\nsuggesting a sepsis originating from these. The presence of Streptococcus phocae is\nhighly suggestive of a grey seal bite. Histology revealed a moderate, chronic-active,\nmultifocal, verminous pneumonia with a granulomatous response. Minimal, per-\nacute, multifocal, necrotising hepatitis. Severe, per-acute, multifocal, epidermal\ntrauma. These findings are suggestive of very recent trauma and would not be\ninconsistent with grey seal attack. There was a verminous pneumonia but | would\nclassify this as within normal limits given the species and the age. The systemic\nrecovery of the various bacteria in the absence of any extensive lesions is an\nanathema. The necrosis in the liver suggests it may have been in the very early stages\nbut not of the severity yet to cause death.

It was immediately recovered for\ntransport to Inverness. However this took four days inn hot weather and consequently the\nanimal was in in condition 3 at examination. The animal was in poor nutritional condition\nwith a mid-sternal blubber thickness of just 12mm. There was no evidence of recent feeding\nwith the stomach empty apart from a heavy nematode burden. The lungs were very\ncongested with stable foam and fluid in the airways. There was pulmonary interstitial\nemphysema over the caudal aspects of the lung. The pulmonary lymph nodes were enlarged\nand the right ventricle of the heart very dilated suggesting some degree of dilated\ncardiomyopathy. The brain showed some dilated cerebral vasculature with some\nneovascularisation over cortex and turbid CSF. This was an aged animal and congestive heart\nfailure is a plausible cause of death in this case, however the role of neuropathology is also a\npossibility. Bacteriology on the brain revealed a mixed culture including Streptococcus equi\nssp. zooepidemicus. Histology showed a severe, acute, generalised, mixed inflammatory cell\nbut primarily suppurative, meningitis/ ventriculitis with extension into the adjacent brain\ntissue. Despite the advanced autolysis of many of the tissues, it is clear that this animal had a\nsevere infectious disease, probably bacterial, and centred on the meninges/brain which\nwould have been highly clinically significant.",

Consequently, since 2014, we have implemented an\ninitiative to recruit and train collaborators and members of the public in the safe, reliable and\naccurate measurement and sampling of dead stranded marine animals. This outlines\ntechniques used for encouraging the public to report strandings and assesses how effective\nthis approach has been to add data and samples to the scheme. Coined by one volunteer as\na way of training “Whale Detectives”, the programme has proved invaluable to SMASS in both\nproviding rapid and reliable information and images about strandings and in many cases\nmeasurement and samples from cases too autolysed, or remote, to enable a necropsy.\n\n14.1 Courses run 2018\n\n \n\nTwo courses were run in 2018 both at Inverness, to help fill in gaps in our coverage.\n1. 09/07/18 training course for new SMASS Volunteers at Inverness SAC.\n2. 05/12/18 training course for new SMASS Volunteers at Inverness SAC.\n\nSince beginning this initiative in 2014, we have trained 212 people, of which 210 were\nconsidered competent to be issued with a kit and wished to be a volunteer, a single\nvolunteer declined to sample.",
