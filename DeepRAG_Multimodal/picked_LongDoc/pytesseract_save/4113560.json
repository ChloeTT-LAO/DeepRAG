Switch on the machine by pressing the power button (I = ON, O = OFF). To switch\non the TRAC model use the button at the automatic circuit breaker (see chapter\n6.1).\n\n4. After your exercise machine has been connected to mains and switched on, it\n\nautomatically carries out an operating check. During this operating check, you will\nbe able to read the software version of the unit on the display. Thereafter the main\nmenu will appear.\n\n5. Stand on the side of the control panel (view onto the display) and check if the\ndisplay works. If this is not the case, make sure you followed the steps above\ncorrectly. In addition, verify if there is electricity in the mains socket (This is not\napplicable to models of the 4000 SP and 4000 S SP series!).\n\n5.4.1 Power Supply\n\nUse your exercise machine only with earthed (grounded) power sockets with 230\nVAC / 50-60 Hz (see chapter A5). If you have any doubts about the power supply at\nthe setup location, ask your energy provider. For TRAC you have in any case to ob-\ntain the permission of your energy provider. Only use commercial 10 ampere (16 am-\npere with TRAC) automatic circuit breakers (type B tripping characteristic). In the rare\nevent that these automatic circuit breakers should switch off when you switch on your\nmachine, the circuit needs to be fused with 10 A (16 A with TRAC) lead fuses or with\na different type of tripping fuse (e.g. K-automat). In case of doubt, ask your electrician.\n\nBefore connecting your ERGO-FIT exercise machine to your power supply system, com-\npare the acceptable voltage and frequency on the name plate (next to power entry module)\nwith your local data.\n\n \n\nTechnical and visual modifications as well as misprints reserved - © 2015 by ERGO-FIT GmbH & Co.

Do not use extension cables or\nmulti-outlet power strips unless they are EN 60601-1 certified.\n\n4000 SP and 4000 S SP machines are equipped with a generator and a rechargeable\nNiMH-battery for power supply. The rechargeable battery is maintenance-free and charged\nduring use. After starting the machine, it provides energy for the control panel. After\nworkout the electricity accumulated in the battery is used to operate the control panel for\nabout 45 seconds. Then the machine switches off automatically. The buffer time reduces\nby increasing charging cycles and lifetime. To reach the target buffer time a weekly charge\n(at least 1x24 hours per week) by a special charging power supply unit, which is available\nwith ERGO-FIT, is indispensable. If the buffer time reduces and can no longer be kept up\nby charging the batteries should be replaced. Due to the self-discharge rate of the batteries\nduring operation at room temperature they should be changed every 2 years.\n\n5.4.2 Cabeling\n\nIf you have connected several ERGO-FIT machines to one circuit never switch on multiple\nmachines.

Keep your upper body upright.\n\nRight from the start and during exercise, always make sure to stand firmly on the\npedals. Always press the STOP button to stop your workout session and wait until\nthe pedals have come to a complete stop before you step off.\n\nThe recommended running direction is forward. However, advanced users may also\nwant to run backwards to improve co-ordination (different muscle groups can be\ntrained this way). Changes of direction should be carried out only after the machine\nhas come to a complete stop.\n\nThe intensity is controlled through the pedaling frequency. You can choose any\npedaling frequency. The speed is not controlled by the machine. Step on the\nmachine and start running after choosing your preferred program with your individual\nand comfortable pedaling frequency. If you want to increase the intensity press\nPLUS (see chapter 6.4.1). If you want to reduce the intensity press MINUS (see\nchapter 6.4.1). The intensity is displayed as step symbol with value indication. It is\nimportant that you maintain your individual pedaling frequency. Avoid repeated\nvariations of your frequency.\n\nFor CARDIO training, consider that CROSS controls the intensity via the brake\nresistance. At the beginning the brake resistance is set according to the minimum\nand maximum heart rate. The user starts with a comfortable pedaling frequency. If\nthe heart rate is too low the resistance will be increased. If the heart rate is too high\nthe resistance will be decreased. If the maximum / minimum speed has been\nreached and the heart rate is not yet out of range the user will be asked to increase/\ndecrease the speed. This is indicated by the faster/slower arrows.\n\nThe PROFILE program is based on workload profiles (workload vs. time).\n\nMaintain the workout position described here during the whole workout.\n\nCYCLE\n\nFirst you have to determine the correct seat height. The height of the seat is\nessential for sitting comfortably and performing a radial even run. To find the right\nseat height, sit on the seat and put one heel on a pedal. In the lowest pedal position,\nyou should be able to extend your leg completely.\n\nTo adjust the seat, stand next to the exercise machine and pull the adjustment lever\non the seat post upwards. The integrated pneumatic spring will automatically lift the\nseat. To lower the seat, release the adjustment lever and push the seat downwards.\ninto the desired position using your body weight. To lock the seat at the desired\nposition, bring the adjustment lever back to its initial position.\n\n \n\nTechnical and visual modifications as well as misprints reserved - © 2015 by ERGO-FIT GmbH & Co.

Use the support bars to keep your balance. Do not lean on the bars. This\naffects the movement pattern in a negative way and makes workout less efficient.\n\nOnce you have reached a certain fitness level you should be able to exercise\nwithout the bars. The arms should swing synchronously to the stepping\nmovement.\n\nAlways keep your upper body upright during exercise (do not arch your spine) and\nnever extend your legs completely.\n\nDo not press the pedals down actively but rely on your body weight instead. When\nthe pedal moves downwards you have to reduce the pressure on the other pedal by\nlifting the foot without loosing the contact to the pedal itself. The pedals move\nindependently of each other.\n\nRubber buffers are placed underneath the pedals to absorb the impacts on the\njoints as soon as the pedals reach the lowest position. Please make sure not to\nperform the motion pattern up to the limit when exercising on the stepper. The\npedals should not stop completely on either the upwards or the downwards motion.\nOnly this way can a linear motion sequence be maintained.\n\nThe intensity is controlled through the pedaling frequency. The machine controls the\nspeed. Step on the machine and start exercising after choosing your preferred\nprogram with your individual and comfortable frequency.

This is the only way to monitor the heart rate and to automatically adapt the\nworkload. In CARDIO/SYSTEM you can control the intensity via the heart rate in order to\nmaintain a steady optimum heart rate throughout the workout.\n\nIt is recommended to use a wireless chest belt for the CARDIO and TEST workout programs.\nContact heart rate values are for information only. In order to determine the maximum and\nminimum heart rate values you have to perform an ERGO-FIT cardio test (CYCLE 4000 S,\n4000 S SP, or 4000 S MED).\n\nYou need to set the following parameters before training:\n\nPULSMAX = maximum heart rate during workout\nPULSMIN = minimum heart rate during workout\nSTART LOAD = workload at the beginning of the workout\nforTRAC = maximum workout speed\n\n(Workout starts with half of the maximum speed)\n\n2 workout modes are available for CARDIO/SYSTEM workouts:\n@ CARDIO workout without chip card\n@ CARDIO workout with chip card\n\nChip card based workout supports both the user and the trainer. The user always exercises\nwithin the optimum heart rate range which prevents the body from becoming overstressed.\nThe trainer on the other hand knows that the member exercises within the optimum range\nand does not have to be monitored all the time. Another advantage of chip card-based\nworkout is that the user does not have to make any other modifications during workout. The\nERGO-FIT chip card allows you to perform the ERGO-FIT cardio points workout.\n\n \n\n54\n\nTechnical and visual modifications as well as misprints reserved - © 2014 by ERGO-FIT GmbH & Co. KG",

    "Page_88": "ERGO-FIT’\n\nWorkout\n\n \n\n8 Workout\n\n8.1 The Effect of the Workout\n\nIf you lead a modern life you are usually not performing sufficient physical activity to stay\nhealthy and in good shape. Cardiovascular diseases are still the most common cause of\ndeath.\n\nThis fact should make cardiovascular training a top priority.\n\nAll exercises that increase the heart rate for at least 15 to 20 minutes are called ,aerobic\".\n\n8.2 Cardiovascular Workout\n\nTo benefit most from your workout you should be familiar with some training principles. Your\nfitness depends to a great extent on your body's ability to provide oxygen to your muscles.\nOxygen is the key to the energy stored in the muscles.\n\nLet us take a closer look at some of the factors that are crucial to this process: The heart acts\nlike a very complex pump and is responsible for the blood circulation in the body. Regular\naerobic training will increase the heart's stroke volume, i.e. with every beat it will transport\nblood through your body. This means that the heart works more efficiently not only during\ntraining but also at rest.\n\nWhen oxygen enters the lungs it will be mixed with blood in tiny air sacs, the so-called alveoli.\nRegular aerobic training will improve the efficiency of the alveoli and thus blood is supplied\nwith more oxygen to be transported to the muscles.\n\nHemoglobin is the substance of the blood that absorbs the oxygen. Regular aerobic training\nwill increase the hemoglobin in the blood which in turn leads to an improved oxygen supply\nof the muscles.\n\nIt is a fact that regular exercise reduces the risk of heart diseases.\nIn other words, regular workout improves the oxygen supply of the body and reduces the risk\n\nof cardiovascular diseases. For this reason, ERGO-FIT cardio workout equipment is used in\ntraining facilities and rehabilitation centers.\n\n \n\n82\n\nTechnical and visual modifications as well as misprints reserved - © 2015 by ERGO-FIT GmbH & Co.

In order to determine your heart\nrate you need to do a performance evaluation. Our cardio training machines allow you to\ncontrol your heart rate constantly even during training.\n\nIf you are a beginner you should exercise in the lower part of your aerobic training zone until\nyour fitness has improved.\n\n8.4 Workout Routine - Aspects to be Considered\n\nIf you exercise for the first time or resume training after a longer period of time you should\nstructure your workout routine according to the following example:\n\n1. Warm up: Exercise for five minutes at low intensity to prepare your body for the\nworkout.\n\n2. Stretching: Get off the exercise machine and stretch the targeted muscle groups.\n\n3. Main sequence: Now you are well prepared for the aerobic sequence which should\n\nlast at least 15 to 20 minutes. Focus on maintaining your heart rate continuously at\nthe target level.\n\n8.5 Weight Reduction — the Benefits\n\nMost beginners primarily wish to reduce body weight, the adipose tissue. Regular training\nstimulates the metabolism and helps to burn more calories both during workout and at rest.\n\nMost beginners get the most aerobic benefit from an intensity level of 70% of the maximum\nheart rate. With increasing fitness you have to adapt the workout intensity. However, the\nassumption ,,The harder the training the greater the progress in fitness“ is wrong. If a certain\nlimit is exceeded you will lose the benefits of an aerobic workout because the body can no\nlonger provide the muscles with oxygen and instead produces large amounts of lactic acid,\nand this will make us stop training very quickly.\n\nWorkout just below the anaerobe limit increases the overall workout time significantly. Thus\nyou burn more fat and strengthen our aerobic system optimally.\n\n8.6 Workout Tips\n\nOn CYCLE 4000/4100 S you can perform a test based on up-to-date results in sports science\nto determine values for an optimum workout that consider gender, age, weight and\nperformance data. The results are displayed after evaluation.\n\n \n\n83\n\nTechnical and visual modifications as well as misprints reserved - © 2015 by ERGO-FIT GmbH & Co. KG",

For this reason, we recommend regular\ninspections of the machines. Before every use, inspect the casing, seat and guides,\nhandlebar, crank handles, footrests, pedals, pedal straps, running belt and handholds for\ndamage. If the machine is damaged, have it repaired immediately. These regular inspections\nare essential in case of guarantee claims. In case of a malfunction please contact our service\nteam. Technicians and engineers at ERGO-FIT are pleased to assist you.\n\nBefore switching on the machines, always inspect power cord, power plug, power socket and\npower input (machine) for defects.\n\nThe following situations make immediate maintenance necessary:\n\n@ excessive mechanical stress (sharp impact, defect cabling, inappropriate tension),\n@ liquid has entered the device,\n\n@ cables, connectors or casing are damaged,\n\n@ covers have dropped off.\n\nMaintenance of the machine may be carried out by the ERGO-FIT customer service.

If this is not the case,\nproceed as follows:\n\nIf the running belt tends to run to the right, turn the right adjustment screw to the\nright. If the running belt tends to run to the left, turn the right adjustment screw to the\nleft. For minor deviations turn the screw % turn. For greater deviations turn the\nscrew % turn.\n\nAfter each adjustment, observe the running belt for two minutes. In order to check\nits function the treadmill should also run at 5 and 20km/h.\n\nAdjustment is complete when the running belt stays in the middle of the shaft even\nafter running at 12 km/h for a longer period of time.\n\nHill running and other running styles may cause a dislocation of the running belt. As\nlong as the running belt centers again when running in normal mode at 12km/h\nadjustment is not necessary. The running belt stays in its position for several months\nif it is adjusted correctly.\n\nIf you want to tighten the running belt, turn the left and right adjustment screws\nevenly.

For this purpose,\nVDE subdivides so-called protection classes.\n\nOf the protection classes allowed for electro-medical devices, in most cases protection class\n| (protective measures with protective earth conductor) as well as protection class II\n(protective measures without protective earth conductor but double insulation) are used: In\nprotection class | devices, metal casing parts are connected with the protective earth\nconductor of the grid through its earthing contact. In case of insulation failure, the upstream\ncircuit breaker will close the circuit.\n\nThe ERGO-FIT devices of the CARDIO LINE 4000/4100, 4000/4100 S, 4000/4100 S MED\nand 4000/4100 MED series are classified as protection class | devices. The ERGO-FIT\ndevices of the CARDIO LINE 4000 SP and 4000 S SP series are classified as protection\nclass II devices.\n\nIn the user's environment, parts of non-medical electric devices, which are touchable after\nremoving covers, connection devices etc. during routine maintenance, must operate with a\ntension not exceeding 25 Volts of alternating current or 60 Volts of direct current. In addition\nthe supply voltage must be generated by a separate power source as described in IEC\n601-1. In this case such a part and the user must not be touched an the same time.\n\nThe use of electro-medical devices is restricted to safety-relevant innocuousness taking\naccount of the state of the art, health and safety regulations and accident prevention.\nProtective measures must be taken to avoid both direct and indirect contact. Covers,\ncoatings, insulation of energized parts in combination with protective measures using\nprotective earth conductors (in compliance with protection class |), melting fuses, as well as\nthe observation of distances between devices are all part of this.\n\n \n\nTechnical and visual modifications as well as misprints reserved - © 2015 by ERGO-FIT GmbH & Co.
