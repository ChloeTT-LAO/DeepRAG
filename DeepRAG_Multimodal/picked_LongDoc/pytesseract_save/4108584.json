Although several of\nthese species are available from both wild and farmed sources, most\ncommercially available Atlantic salmon is farmed. Salmon live in the Atlantic\nand Pacific oceans, as well as the Great Lakes (North America) and other\nlandlocked lakes.\n\nTypically, salmon are anadromous: they are born in freshwater, migrate to the\nocean, then return to freshwater to reproduce.\n\nAbout 80% of the world’s salmon harvest is farmed. Farming mainly takes\nplace in large nets in sheltered waters such as fjords or bays. Most farmed\nsalmon come from Norway, Chile, Scotland and Canada.\n\nSalmon is a popular food. Salmon consumption is considered to be healthy\n\ndue to its high content of protein and omega-3 fatty acids and it is also a\ngood source of minerals and vitamins.\n\n71Page mMOowI",

As the fastest growing animal-based food\nproducing sector, aquaculture is a major contributor to this, and its growth\noutpaces population growth.\n\nAquaculture has expanded fish availability to regions and countries with\notherwise limited or no access to the cultured species. At the global level,\nsince 2016, aquaculture has been the main source of fish available for human\nconsumption. In 2020, this share was 54 percent, a figure that can be\nexpected to continue to increase in the long term.\n\nIn 2020, aquaculture accounted for 86 million tonnes (LW) destined for direct\nhuman food consumption, while wild capture accounted for 73 million tonnes\n(LW). However, fish has been estimated to account for only 7% of global\nprotein consumption (and about 17% of total fish and animal protein supply).\n\nWorld aquaculture production of farmed aquatic animals has been\ndominated by Asia, with an 89 percent share in the last two decades.\n\nSources: FAO (2020) The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2020, OECD-FAO (2020)\nAgricultural Outlook 2020-2029, Kontali Analyse\n\n12|Page MQwWI",

The product is present in most\ngeographies and segments. Due to biological constraints, seawater temperature\nrequirements and other natural constraints, farmed salmon is mainly produced in sea\nin Norway, Chile, UK, North America, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand\nand Tasmania.\n\nLarge trout: Produced in Norway, Chile and the Faroe Islands, the main markets are\nJapan and Russia. Trout is mainly sold fresh, but is also used for smoked production.\nSmall trout: Produced in many countries and most often consumed locally as a\ntraditional dish as hot smoked or portion fish. Small trout is not in direct competition\nwith Atlantic salmon.\n\nCoho: Produced in Chile and is mostly used for salted products. It is a competitor of\ntrout and sockeye in the red fish market. Although Russia has increased its import of\nthis fish over the last few years, Japan remains the largest market.\n\nPink: Caught in USA and Russia and used for canning, pet food and roe production.\nSince quality is lower than the other species it is a less valued salmonid. The fish is\nsmall in size (1.5-1.7 kg) and is caught over a very short time period.\n\nChum: Caught in Japan and Alaska. Most is consumed in Japan and China. In\nJapan, it is available as fresh, while in China it is processed for local consumption and\nre-exported. Little chum is found in the EU market. The catch varies in quality and\npart of the catch is not fit for human consumption.\n\nSockeye: Caught in Russia and Alaska. It is mostly exported frozen to Japan, but\nsome is consumed locally in Russia and some canned in Alaska. Sockeye is seen as a\nhigh quality salmonid and is used for salted products, sashimi and some is smoked in\nthe EU.\n\nChinook/King: Small volumes, but highly valued.

The world’s population is expected to grow to almost 10 billion by 2050.\n\nThe health benefits of seafood are increasingly being promoted by global\nhealth authorities. The EAT-Lancet Commission recommends increased\nconsumption of fish, dry beans and nuts as sustainable, healthy protein\nsources. Farm-raised salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins and\nminerals.\n\nGlobal fisheries are to a large extent fully exploited, meaning the supply of\nwild fish has limited potential to meet the growing demand for marine protein.\n\nThe middle class is growing in large emerging markets, allowing more people\nto eat different, and more nutritious, protein rich foods, such as fish, meat and\neggs. Consumption of high-quality proteins is expected to increase.\n\nAnother demographic trend driving shifts in demand is the aging population.\nHealthy eating becomes especially important as you grow older.\n\nClimate change is the greatest environmental challenge the world has ever\nfaced.

Furthermore, salmon is a versatile product suitable for both\ntraditional and evolving food occasions. It is a good choice for Sunday dinner\nwith the family or at the restaurant, but also a great product for food festivals\nor just as a snack. Another feature that makes salmon relevant for multiple\noccasions is that it can be served in many forms - raw, grilled, cooked and\nsmoked. It appeals to people of all ages as it addresses the health needs of\nthe elderly, while being equally attractive to youngsters.\n\nThere is a rising demand for more sustainable food and a willingness to pay for\nit.

Protein resource efficiency is expressed as “Protein\nretention”, which is a measure of how much animal food protein is produced\nper unit feed protein fed to the animal. Salmon has a protein retention of 28%,\nwhich is more efficient than pork and cattle (see table above).\n\nCalorie retention is measured by dividing calories in edible portion by calories\nin feed. Salmon has a high calorie retention of 25%.\n\nThe main reason why salmon convert protein and energy to body muscle and\nweight so efficiently is that they are cold-blooded and therefore do not have\nto use energy to heat their bodies. Furthermore they do not expend energy\non standing up like land animals do.\n\n¢ Edible yield is calculated by dividing edible meat by total body weight.\nAtlantic salmon has a high edible yield of 73%.\n\n* Feed conversion ratios measure how efficiently the different animal\nproteins are produced.

The coastlines are within certain latitude bands in the Northern\nand Southern Hemispheres.\n\nA key condition is a temperature range between zero and 20°C. The optimal\ntemperature range for salmon is between 8 and 14°C.\n\nSalmon farming also requires a certain amount of current to allow a flow of\nwater through the farm. The current must however be below a certain level to\nallow the fish to move freely around in the sites. Such conditions are typically\nfound in waters protected by archipelagos and fjords and this rules out many\ncoastlines. However, offshore farming is an emerging approach. Offshore\nfarms are positioned in deeper and less sheltered waters, where ocean\ncurrents are stronger than they are inshore, and they therefore require more\nrobust cages.\n\nCertain biological parameters are also required to allow efficient production.\nBiological conditions vary significantly within the areas adopted for salmon\nfarming and are prohibitive in certain other areas.\n\nPolitical willingness to permit salmon farming and to regulate the industry is\nalso required. License systems have been adopted in all areas where salmon\nfarming is carried out.\n\nLand based salmon farming (full-cycle) has attracted increased investments\nin the past years.

The\ncarbon footprint is only 7.9 kg of carbon equivalent per kg of edible product,\ncompared with 6.2 kg of carbon equivalent per edible kg of poultry, 12.2 kg per\nedible kg of pork and 39.0 kg per edible kg of beef.\n\nBy replacing land animal protein production with farmed salmon, significant CO2\nemissions are avoided. Assuming that global salmon production replaced a mix of\npoultry, pork and beef production in 2020, 14.0 million tonnes of CO2 emissions were\navoided.\n\nNet avoided carbon emissions 2020\n30\n\n7xe Ma\n\niN)\na\n\n14.0\n\nN\n3\n\nMillion tonnes CO,e\no Ga\n\na\n\n \n\n°\n\nLand animal protein Global salmon production Net avioded CO2e\nproduction\n\nGenetic changes in wild salmon\n\nMost escaped farmed salmon disappear into the open sea. They are likely to die\nfrom starvation or disease, or be eaten by predators. Still, some survive after\nescaping, and migrate into the rivers each year, posing a risk of genetic changes in\na river's wild salmon population.\n\nThe Institute of Marine Research considered seven out of 13 production areas in\nNorway to be at high risk for further genetic changes. Three production areas are\nconsidered to be at moderate risk and three production areas are considered to be\nat low risk.\n\nEnvironmental effects of discharges of dissolved nutrients\nDissolved nutrient salts are released into coastal waters by population (sewage),\nindustry, agriculture and aquaculture.

Even though increased concentrations of dissolved nutrients in\ncoastal waters may cause adverse ecosystem changes, the risk of regional\nenvironmental impacts as a result of dissolved nutrients from fish farming is\nconsidered low in all production areas according to the Institute of Marine Research.\n\nEnvironmental impact on the seabed as a result of particulate organic emissions\nOpen pens release organic particles directly into the environment in the form of\nfaeces from the fish and feed that is not eaten. Such discharges can affect the\nenvironment to a greater or lesser extent around the fish farm. However, the\nemissions mainly consist of easily degradable compounds, the impact is reversible,\nand the seabed can fully regenerate over a few months to a few years. Farmers are\nobliged by law to monitor the seabed continuously in accordance with NS 9410 or\nother national regulations, so that the environmental impact of aquaculture is within\nacceptable limits. If the environmental impact on the seabed is not acceptable, the\nsite may be fallowed, production reduced or the site reallocated to a different\nlocation.\n\nBased on reporting made through today's monitoring system, the condition of soft-\nbottom sites is considered to be good in all production areas in Norway and the risk\nof unacceptable environmental impacts due to particulate organic emissions is low.\nAs of today, there is no good monitoring of hard-bottom sites and this has therefore\nnot been evaluated.\n\nMowi measures the potential impact of organic loading on the seabed according to\nnational seabed quality standards. Results show that, on average, 93% of its sea sites\nsurveyed in 2020 have a minimal impact on faunal communities and/or sediment\nchemistry near to the fish pens.\n\nEnvironmental effects on non-target species when using medicine\nSea lice belong to the animal group of crustaceans, and medicine that treats sea\nice can also affect other species.\n\nThere are differences in the way treatments affect non-target species. Bath\nreatments provide a short-term effect, while oral treatment may affect non-target\nspecies over a longer period of time. Bath treatments include hydrogen peroxide,\nazamethiphos, cypermethrin and deltamethrin, and the treatment takes place either\ndirectly in the pen or in the well boat. If treatment is done in pens, the bath\n\nreatment is released directly into the sea. When the treatment takes place in a well\nboat, the bathing agent is released while the vessel is in motion. However,\npurification systems that remove the medicine used in well boat-delivered bath\nreatments have come to the market in recent years. The oral treatment considered\nis diflubbenzuron, teflubenzuron and emamectin, which can be released to the\nenvironment via feed and faeces.\n\nThe Institute of Marine Research's risk assessment is a comprehensive assessment and\nemphasises, among other things, total consumption, toxicity and occurrence in the\nenvironment in Norway.

In any life cycle assessment (LCA)* of salmon farming, feed also\nmakes the largest contribution to its environmental footprint. Important\nparameters for the carbon footprint arising from feed consumption are feed\nefficiency and feed ingredients.\n\nFeed efficiency\n\nThe feed conversion ratio (FCR) describes the amount of feed used to\nproduce a certain amount of salmon. Efficient feeding, that is to say releasing\nthe minimum amount of feed beyond what is actually eaten, is important\nsince the footprint of the feed released dominates the overall carbon\nfootprint of the product. Improvements in feed formulations and in feed\nmanufacture, combined with better on-farm feed management, can hugely\nreduce the quantity of feed (and thus the feed raw materials) used per\nkilogram of farmed aquatic food produced.\n\nFeed ingredients\n\nThe current carbon footprint of farmed salmon shows that it is critical to\nchange what the salmon is fed. Simply shifting between existing feed inputs,\nsuch as from marine to terrestrial inputs only leads to trade-offs between\nenvironmental impact categories.\n\nIn 1990 the average Norwegian salmon diet contained 65% fish meal and 24%\nfish oil.

The cost of energy consumption will depend on the price of\nelectricity and the temperature. A cold winter will demand more electricity to\nheat the water used in the smolt facility. The size of the smolt will also influence\nelectricity consumption as a larger smolt has a longer production cycle in the\nsmolt facility.

Fair value is estimated by the use of a calculation model, where cash\ninflows are functions of estimated volume multiplied by estimated price. Fish\nready for harvest (4 kg GWT, which corresponds to 4.8 kg LW) is valued at\nexpected sales price with a deduction of costs related to harvest, transport\netc. to arrive at back-to-farm prices. For fish not ready for harvest (i.e. below 4\nkg GWT), the model uses an interpolation methodology where the known\ndata points are i) the value of the fish when put to sea and ii) the estimated\nvalue of the fish when it has reached harvest size. The valuation reflects the\nexpected quality grading and size distribution.\n\nBroodstock and smolt are measured at cost less impairment losses, as fair\nvalue cannot be measured reliably.\n\nThe change in estimated fair value is recognised in profit or loss on a\ncontinuous basis and is classified separately (not included in the cost of the\nharvested biomass). On harvesting, the fair value adjustment is reversed on\nthe same line.\n\nOperational EBIT\n\nOperational EBIT and other operational results are reported based on the\nrealised costs of harvested volume and do not include fair value adjustments\non biomass.\n\n58 | Page MQwWI",

This is a result of a\nlong production cycle, a fragmented industry, market conditions and a\nbiological production process which is affected by many external factors.\n\nOver time, production costs have been reduced and productivity has\nincreased on the back of new technology and improved techniques. In\nrecent years, costs have trended upwards due to several factors including\nrising feed costs, biological costs and more stringent regulatory compliance\nprocedures.\n\nReported revenues: Revenues are a gross figure; they can include invoiced\nfreight from reference place (e.g. FCA Oslo) to customer, and have\ndiscounts, commissions and credits deducted. Reported revenues can also\ninclude revenues from trading activity, sales of by-products, insurance\ncompensation, gain/loss on sale of assets etc.\n\nPrice: Reported prices are normally stated in the terms of a specific reference\nprice e.g. the Nasdaq price for Norway (FCA Oslo) and UB price for Chile\n(FOB Miami). Reference prices do not reflect freight, and other sales reducing\nitems mentioned above. Reference prices are for one specific product\n(Nasdaq price = sales price per kg head on gutted fish packed fresh in a\nstandard box). Sales of other products (frozen products, fresh fillets and\nportions) will cause deviation in the achieved prices vs. reference price.\nReference prices are for superior quality fish, while achieved prices are for a\nmix of qualities, including downgrades.

Cost per kilo is increasing as farmers increase the size of\nthe smolt in the hatchery before release to sea. The cost is expected to be offset by\nshorter time in sea, less lice treatment etc.\n\nLabour cost: Salmon production is a capital-intensive industry and labour cost\naccounts for a minor part of total costs. However, labour cost increased in the period\n2014-2017, partly because of increased employment in relation to lice issues. It has\nbeen stable the last few years.\n\nHarvest/ Packing/ Well boat: Costs relating to transportation of live fish, slaughtering,\nprocessing and packing are all heavily dependent on quantity, logistics and\nautomation.\n\nDepreciation: The industry is investing heavily in new technology and automation,\nbut also in equipment used to treat lice, which in turn leads to higher depreciation\ncosts.\n\nMisc. operating costs: Other costs include direct and indirect costs, administration,\ninsurance, biological costs (excluding mortality), etc.\n\nSource: Kontali Analyse.

The use of these two marine raw materials in feed\nproduction has been reduced in favour of ingredients such as soy, sunflower,\nwheat, corn, beans, peas, poultry by-products (in Chile and Canada) and\nrapeseed oil. This substitution is mainly due to heavy constraints on the\navailability of fish meal and fish oil.\n\nAtlantic salmon have specific nutrient requirements for amino acids, fatty\nacids, vitamins, minerals and other lipid- and water-soluble components.\nThese essential nutrients can in principle be provided by the range of different\nraw materials listed above. Fish meal and other raw materials of animal origin\nhave a more complete amino acid profile and generally have a higher\nprotein concentration compared to proteins of vegetable origin. As long as a\nfish receives the amino acid it needs it will grow and be healthy and the\ncomposition of its muscle protein is the same irrespective of feed protein\nsource. Consequently, feeding salmon with non-marine protein sources results\nin a net production of marine fish protein.\n\nDuring the industry’s early phases, salmon feed was moist (high water\ncontent) with high levels of marine protein (60%) and low levels of fat/oil\n(10%). In the 1990s, feed typically consisted of 45% protein, made up mostly of\nmarine protein. Today, the marine protein level is lower due to cost\noptimisation and the availability of fish meal. However, the most interesting\ndevelopment has been the increasingly higher inclusion of fat. This has been\nmade possible through technological development and extruded feeds.\n\nSource: www.nifes.no, Holtermann, Mowi\n\n66| Page MQwWI",

On average, a\nnet working capital investment of approximately EUR 3.1/kg is required, split\nbetween the year of harvest and the year immediately preceding harvest, in\norder to obtain an increase in harvest volume of 1 kg. The working capital\nrequirement has increased over time and fluctuates with variations in\ncurrency exchange rates.\n\nNet working capital varies during the year. Growth of salmon is heavily\nimpacted by changing seawater temperatures. Salmon grows at a higher\npace during summer/autumn and more slowly during winter/spring when the\nwater is colder. As the harvest pattern is relatively constant during the year,\nthis leads to large seasonal variations in net working capital. For a global\noperator, net working capital normally peaks around year-end and bottoms\nout around mid-summer.\n\nSource: Mowi\n\n70 | Page MQwWI",

The\nworking capital effects are shown above on a net basis excluding effects from\naccounts receivable and accounts payable.\n\nBy the point of harvest there have been up to 36 months of costs to produce the fish,\ncomprising the cost of producing the smolt two years ago, further costs incurred to\ngrow the fish in seawater, and some costs related to harvest (\"Month 37”).

If production going forward (next\ngenerations) follows the same pattern, most of the cash flow will be reinvested into\nsalmon at various growth stages. If the company wishes to grow its future output, the\nfollowing generations need to be larger requiring even more of the cash flow to be\nreinvested in working capital.\n\nThis is a rolling process and requires substantial amounts of working capital to be tied\nup, both when in a steady state and especially when increasing production.\n\nSource: Mowi\n\n71 | Page MQwWI",

The license regime varies across\njurisdictions.\n\n80 | Page MQwWI",
    "Page_81": "Barriers to Entry — Licenses\n\n11.1 Regulation of fish farming in Norway\n\nLicense and location\n\nFish farming companies in Norway are subject to a large number of regulations. The\nAquaculture Act (17 June 2005) and the Food Safety Act (19 December 2003) are the two\nmost important laws, and there are detailed provisions set out in the various regulations which\nemanated from them.\n\nIn Norway, a salmon-farming license allows salmon farming either in freshwater\n(smolt/fingerling production) or in the sea. The number of licenses for Atlantic salmon and\ntrout in seawater was limited to 1,087 in 2020. Such limitations do not apply for freshwater\nlicenses (smolt production), which can be applied for at any time. Seawater licenses in can\nuse up to four farming sites (six sites are allowed when alll sites are connected with the same\nlicenses). This increases the capacity and efficiency of the sites.\n\nNew seawater licenses are awarded by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and\nFisheries and are administered by the Directorate of Fisheries. Licenses can be sold and\npledged, and legal security is registered in the Aquaculture Register. Since 1982, new licenses\nhave been awarded only in certain years and growth in biomass is today regulated on the\nbasis of the new system for growth implemented in 2017.\n\nProduction limitations in Norway are regulated as \"maximum allowed biomass\" (MAB), which\nis the defined maximum volume of fish a company can hold at sea at all times. In general,\none license sets a MAB of 780 tonnes (945 tonnes in the counties of Troms and Finnmark). The\nsum of the MAB permitted by all the licenses held in each region is the farming company's\ntotal allowed biomass in this region. In addition, each production site has its own MAB and\nthe total amount of fish at each site must be less than this set limit. Generally, sites have a\nMAB of between 2,340 and 4,680 tonnes.\n\nThe Norwegian coast is divided into 13 geographical areas of production. The level of sea\nlice in these areas decide if the MAB can increase (6%), stay the same or decrease (6%) in\nthese areas. Every second year the government announces the conditions for growth on\nexisting and new licenses.\n\nSites complying with very strict environmental standards are offered additional growth. The\nconditions for this growth are A) below 0.1 lice per fish at every counting for the past two\nyears in the period April 1st to September 30th and B) a maximum of one treatment during\nthe last cycle of production. For sites meeting this standard a maximum of 6% growth is\noffered, regardless of the general situation in the different production areas.\n\nIn “red” areas, companies will need to reduce production by 6%.\n\nNine areas were in 2020 defined as “green”, two areas as “yellow” and two areas were\ndefined as “red”.\n\nThere has been a debate in Norway regarding new taxes aimed at the salmon farming\nindustry. In 2020 the Norwegian government discarded a proposal to introduce a 40%\nresource tax in Norway. The Government instead proposed a production fee of NOK 0.4/kg of\nsalmon produced, and the Parliament decided to impose this fee with effect from 2021.\n\n81| Page MQwWI",

    "Page_85": "Barriers to Entry — Licenses\n\n11.2 Regulation of fish farming in Scotland\n\nLicenses and location\n\nIn Scotland, instead of a formal license, permissions are required from four organisations\nbefore setting up a fish farming site; Planning Permission from the local Planning Authority, a\nMarine license from Marine Scotland; an environmental license from the Scottish Environment\nProtection Agency (SEPA) and an Aquaculture Production Business authorisation, also from\nMarine Scotland. The Maximum Allowed Biomass (MAB) for individual sites is determined\nbased on an assessment of environmental concerns, including the carrying capacity of the\nlocal marine environment to be able to accommodate the fish farm. During 2019 SEPA\nintroduced a new regulatory framework for the licensing of marine fish farms in Scotland. This\nincluded new limits on the spatial extent of the impact mixing zone around farms, the use of\nmore accurate modelling tools and more enhanced environmental monitoring. MAB is not\nuniform and varies depending on site characteristics and location. The combination of the\nnew standard, the more accurate model and enhanced monitoring has enabled the\napproval of larger farms than would not previously have been approved (i.e. >2,500 tonnes)\nprovided they are appropriately sited in sustainable locations. Mowi Scotland now has four of\nthese larger MAB farms and others in process of application.\n\nThe Crown Estate owns and manages most of the seabed around the UK out to a distance of\n12 nautical miles. Anyone who develops or operates in UK territorial waters is doing so on\nCrown Estate property. Because of this, you have to apply for a lease from The Crown Estate\nand pay rent to install and operate your farm on the seabed. Most existing licenses are\nautomatically renewed at the end of their lease period. A Crown Estate lease is generally\ngranted for a 25-year period and is dependent on securing planning permission.\n\nThe environmental license from SEPA can be reviewed and MAB reduced in the event of\nnon-compliance with environmental standards and potentially revoked in cases of significant\nand long-term non-compliance.\n\nNew site applications can take 6 months for planning permission to be granted with the\ndetermination period for applications for the environmental license being 4 months, however\nboth can take significantly longer. Expansion of existing facilities, subject to environmental\nsuitability is the most efficient route in terms of cost and time; new sites will take a greater\namount of time and will be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in order to\nsecure planning permission.\n\nThe environmental license charge is charged annually, calculated according to 3 elements;\nactivity and environmental components, and a compliance factor. The annual charge can\nin some cases be >15,000 GBP. Standing rent is levied by the Crown Estate on the basis of\nproduction levels: GBP 27.50 per tonne harvested for Mainland sites; GBP 24.75 per tonne for\nWestern Isles sites; GBP 1,000 annual charge if a site is not in production for 4 consecutive\nyears followed by a GBP 2,000 annual charge if the site is dormant for a further 2 years. A\n100% increase to the dormancy charge then applies every second year a site remains\ninactive to encourage the use of dormant sites. Planning permission applications are also\ncharged at GBP 183 per 0.1 hectare of farm surface area and GBP 63 per 0.1 hectare of sea\nbed while the SEPA license application fee is GBP 4,202 for a new site.\n\n85 | Page MQwWI",

The\nlicensing process is complex.\n\nThe Aquaculture and Foreshore Management Division, (AFMD) of the Department manages\nthe processing of aquaculture licenses on behalf of the Minister. The Marine Engineering\nDivision (MED) of the Department undertakes site mapping and provides certain technical\nadvice on applications as well as undertaking certain post-licensing inspection duties. The\nMarine Institute (MI) provides scientific advice on a range of marine environment and\naquaculture matters and in the case of applications which require Appropriate Assessment\n(AA) under EU Birds and Habitats Directives. Advice is also provided by Bord lascaigh Mhara\n(BIM) and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). The National Parks and Wildlife\nServices (NPWS) are consulted in relation to habitat protection. Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFl), An\nTaisce and the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) are also consulted. Where relevant, the\nLocal Authority and/or Harbour Authority are consulted. Land based fin fish units also require\nplanning consent from the local authority. All applications are released for public\nconsultation and comment.\n\nAn Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) is mandatory for marine finfish\napplications and applicants are required to submit an EIAR with their initial applications. The\nobligation to carry out an Appropriate Assessment (AA) applies if the application is within a\nNatura 2000 site or likely to impact on a Natura 2000 site. Decisions of the Minister in respect\nof aquaculture license applications, including license conditions, may be appealed to the\nAquaculture Licenses Appeals Board (ALAB). ALAB can confirm, refuse or vary a decision\nmade by the Minister or issue licenses itself under its own authority.\n\nLicenses are typically issued for 10 years. The 1997 Act provides for license duration of up to 20\nyears. Foreshore (seabed) leases and licenses are companion consents to Aquaculture\nLicenses. Foreshore Acts allow for leases and licenses to be granted for terms not exceeding\nninety-nine years, respectively. Terms of current licenses vary between harvest output (tons)\nper annum, smolt number input, maximum number of fish on site or a combination of these.\nPrior to expiry of a license, an application for renewal of the license must be made.\n\nCurrently the processing of a marine fin fish license takes between 87 and 260 weeks. Most\nlicenses will be appealed to ALAB which can take at least a further 272 weeks to determine.\nThe process of renewing expired fin fish licenses takes as long as a new application.\n\nIn 2017, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine initiated an independent review of the\nAquaculture licencing system in Ireland. The report of this review was published in May 2017\nwith the overarching conclusion, that a root-and-branch reform of the aquaculture license\napplication processes is necessary which encompasses a further 30 recommendations.\n\nAnnual fin fish culture license fees for a marine based fin fish site are €6.35 per tonne for the\nfirst 100 tonnes plus €6.35 for each additional tonne. Foreshore rental fees are charged at\n€63.49 for up to and including 5 hectares of foreshore with each additional hectare up to 10\nha at €31.74 and each additional hectare >10 and up to 20 at €63.49. Annual culture license\nfee for a land-based site is €127.97 per annum.\n\n86 | Page MQwWI",
    "Page_87": "Barriers to Entry — Licenses\n\n11.4 Regulation of fish farming in Chile\n\nLicense and location\n\nIn Chile licensing is based on two authorisations. The first authorisation is required to operate\nan aquaculture facility and specifies certain technical requirements. It is issued by the\nUndersecretaries of Fisheries and Aquaculture (under the Ministry of Economy). The second\nauthorisation relates to the physical area which may be operated (or permission to use\nnational sea areas for aquaculture production). This is issued by the Undersecretaries for\nArmed Forces (Ministry of Defence). The use of the license is restricted to a specific\ngeographic area, to defined species, and to a specified limit of production or stocking\ndensity. The production and stocking density limits are specified in Environmental and Sanitary\nResolutions for the issued license. Under certain conditions, owners can choose to reduce\ntheir whole stocking, producing at maximum density (17kg/m3 for Atlantic salmon), or to\nmaintain or increase their stocking, using a limited density (from 4 to 17 kg/m3 for Atlantic\nsalmon) determined by productive, sanitary and environmental conditions of each\nneighbourhood, any increase over previous stocking numbers means going to 4 kg/m3.\nOwners can choose only one alternative to stock each semester. From January 2021, all\nproducers will have the option to increase the smolt stocking based on a combined score of\nfish health parameters, related to losses, sea lice treatments and antibiotic use. The individual\ncompany's performance on the parameters in the previous period will determine the size of\nthe potential increase in the next smolt stocking. A positive assessment will result in an\nincrease of 9%, 6% or 3%, while a negative assessment will result in a decrease of -3%, -6% or -\n9%. For example, if antibiotic consumption is below 300 g / tonne, mortality is less than 10%\nand the indicator related to bath treatments against Caligus is below 50%, the model will\nallow farmer the option to grow by 6% in the next stocking.\n\nAccess to Licenses\n\nThe trading of licenses in Chile is regulated by the General Law of Fisheries and Aquaculture\n(LGPA) and controlled by the Undersecretaries of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Ministry of\nEconomy. Aquaculture activities are subject to different governmental authorisations\ndepending on whether they are developed in private fresh water inland facilities (i.e.\nhatcheries) or in facilities built on public assets such as lakes or rivers (freshwater licenses) or at\nsea (seawater licenses).\n\nTo operate a private freshwater aquaculture facility requires ownership of the water-use rights\nand holding of environmental permits. Environmental permits are issued when operators\ndemonstrate that their facilities comply with the applicable environmental regulations.\n\nLicenses for aquaculture activities in public assets are granted based on an application,\nwhich must contain a description of the proposed operations, including a plan for complying\nwith environmental and other applicable regulations. Licenses granted after April 2010 are\ngranted for 25 years and are renewable for additional 25-year terms. Licenses granted before\nApril 2010 were granted for indefinite periods. License holders must begin operation within\none year of receiving a license and once the operation has started, the license holder\ncannot stop or suspend production for a period exceeding two consecutive years. Subject to\ncertain exceptions, license holders must maintain minimum operational levels of not less than\n5% of the yearly production specified in the RCA (Environmental Qualification Resolution).\nUntil August 2016, all licenses not used could be kept by the holder if they prepared an official\nSanitary Management Plan.\n\nLicense holders must pay annual license fees to the Chilean government and may sell or rent\n\ntheir licenses. For the moment, no new licenses will be granted in the most concentrated\nregions, Regions X, XI, and XII (Chile is made up of 16 administrative regions).\n\n87 | Page MQwWI",
    "Page_88": "Barriers to Entry — Licenses\n\n11.5 Regulation of fish farming in Canada\n\nLicense and location\n\nFish farming companies in Canada are subject to different regulations depending on the\ngeographical area they operate in. The Federal Fisheries Act, Navigation Protection Act,\nHealth of Animals Act and the National Aquaculture Activities Regulation (AAR) are some of\nthem. The three geographical areas with fish farming are British Columbia, Newfoundland,\nand New Brunswick.\n\n© operate a marine fish farm site, provincial and/or federal authorisations are required. In\nNewfoundland and New Brunswick, the Provincial government is the primary regulator and\neasing authority. The Province regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture and\nissues the Aquaculture License and Crown Land lease where fish farms are located. In\nNewfoundland, the Crown Land Lease for the site is issued for 50 years and the aquaculture\nLicense is issued for 6 years. In New Brunswick, individual sites are typically granted for 20\nyears. All Commercial Aquaculture Licenses are renewable but may be lost or suspended for\nnon-compliance issues and non-payment of fees.\n\nn British Columbia, Federal and Provincial authorizations are required to operate a marine fish\narm site. The Federal Government regulates the activity and operations of aquaculture while\nthe Provincial Government administers the Crown lands where fish farms are located. The\nProvince grants a license to occupy an area of the ocean associated with the individual fish\narming site. The tenured encompasses the rearing pens, ancillary infrastructure and all\nmoorings. Individual site tenures have a specific timeline ranging from five to twenty years.\n\nhe term of tenure is based upon the provincial policy at the time of offer. In 2020, the annual\nee for a typical 35 hectares tenure is $20,000 CAD per year. This fee is calculated based on\nthe tenure size and a provincially indexed land value. Each tenure license contains a renewal\nprovision once expired. It is uncommon for a tenure to not be renewed, however breaches to\na tenure agreement can result in tenure not being renewed.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe production limitations in Canada are regulated as either a “Maximum Allowable\nBiomass” or a fixed number of smolt per cycle. “MAB” is specific to each Aquaculture\nlicensed facility in British Columbia. Smaller farms are typically licensed for 2,200mt. with larger\ncapacity facilities licensed to produce 5,000 mt. per cycle. In Newfoundland and New\nBrunswick, a maximum number of smolt per cycle is given to a farm. Farms are typically\nlicensed for 600,000 to 1,000,000 smolt per cycle in Newfoundland, and 250,000 to 600,000\nsmolt per cycle in New Brunswick.\n\nIn British Columbia, the Federal Government grants an Aquaculture License with conditions\nthat a farm must meet. The Aquaculture license conditions are linked to The Fisheries Act.\nAquaculture license conditions specify the species being farmed, the Maximum Allowable\nBiomass (MAB) on the site, the type of rearing equipment and the allowable environmental\nimpact. Production or “MAB” is specific to each site. The annual license fee is calculated at\n$2.85 CAD per ton of MAB for operational sites. Facilities that are fallow pay only a $100 CAD\nadministrative fee. All Aquaculture licenses are renewable but may be lost or suspended for\nnon-payment of fees.\n\nAccess to Licenses\n\nAll permits and licenses require consultation with First Nations and local stakeholders. The time\ntaken to acquire licenses for a new farm can vary from one to several years. The cost for\npreparing a new site license application can cost up to $300,000 CAD. The location of\naquaculture farms is regulated by both the Provincial and Federal governments. The Province\nregulates the land use and the Federal government sets out site specific requirements to limit\nimpacts to critical species and habitats. Companies with the support of local First Nations can\nstill obtain new tenures.\n\n88 | Page MQwWI",
    "Page_89": "Barriers to Entry — Licenses\n\nIn December 2020, the Federal Government instituted policy prohibiting the restocking of\nfarms in the Discovery Islands area and removal of all sites by June 2022. A court challenge\nby all affected operating companies was initiated and an injunction was recently approved.\nA judicial review process is ongoing.\n\nIn Newfoundland, proponents must submit a sea cage license application to the\nNewfoundland Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture for each new or acquired\nmarine site. In New Brunswick, companies must submit an Aquaculture license Application for\nMarine Sites to the Department of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries (New Brunswick). It\ntakes about nine months to transition an existing site to a new owner, and approximately one\nyear for a new application in both places. This includes obtaining all necessary approvals and\nlicenses, and a review from The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (Federal). Consultation\nwith residents, towns, development groups and commercial/recreational fishermen is\nrequired. In Newfoundland, all new sites of the same company must be 1 km apart, 5 km if\nsites are operated by different companies. Consultations with First nations is now required in\nboth New Brunswick and Newfoundland prior to submission of the application.\n\nIn Newfoundland, Provincial approvals can be assigned to a different operator through a\ngovernment sub-lease assignment process, however, licenses are not transferable.

    "Page_90": "Barriers to Entry — Licenses\n\n11.6 Regulation of fish farming in the Faroe Islands\n\nLicense and location\n\nFish farming companies in the Faroe Islands are subject to extensive regulation. The most\nimportant legislative instruments are the Aquaculture Act (Act No. 83 from 25 May 2009 with\nlatest amendments from 2018), the Environmental Act (Act No. 134 from 29 October 1988 with\nlatest amendments from 2008) and the Food Safety Act (Act No. 58 from 26 May 2010 with\nlatest amendments from 2017).\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned acts, several Executive Orders with more detailed\nprovisions covering fish farming have been issued under the provisions of the acts.\n\nThe right according to a specific license is provided for a specific geographic area and with\na limit of production specified in the individual license. Production and stocking density limit is\nspecified in an Environmental and Sanitary Resolution issued for each specific license. The\ndensity limit may depend on production conditions as well as sanitary and environmental\nconditions.\n\nThe size of the area and density limits etc. for each of the 20 sea licenses vary greatly.\nProduction limitations in the Faroes are not regulated through limits on \"maximum allowed\nbiomass”, MAB. As a consequence, MAB for salmon farms varies between 1,200 tonnes and\n5,800 tonnes a year per license, depending on site characteristics and the geographic\nlocation of the individual farm.\n\nIn 2012 and 2018 the Government of the Faroe Islands announced revised aquaculture\nregulations with the aim of securing sustainable growth in the industry and in order to\nimplement anti-trust regulations.\n\nMowi Faroes is first and foremost affected by the anti-trust regulations in the Aquaculture Act.\nThese rules set a cap of 20% for either direct or indirect foreign ownership in Faroese fish\nfarming companies. If the limit is exceeded with regard to a fish farming company, the\ncompany must adjust its ownership to be within the limit within a short deadline set by the\nauthorities or face possible loss of the right to conduct fish farming activities.\n\nMowi Faroes is 100% owned by Mowi ASA (NO). This ownership is protected by transitional\nprovisions in the Aquaculture Act, securing that the company can remain owned by a\nforeign company and nonetheless keep its licenses. The consequence for Mowi Faroes of the\nAnti-trust regulations is that the company cannot expand its business with additional\ncommercial licenses to farm fish in the sea. Mowi Faroes can however apply for develooment\nlicenses and licenses on land.\n\nIt is stipulated in the Aquaculture Act that a fish farming company cannot hold more than\n50% of the total sea licenses. The new restrictions do not apply to licenses held by each\nindividual company today, but the new regulations specify that Mowi Faroes can keep its 3\nseawater licenses and 1 smolt license, even though the company does not comply with the\nnew cap on foreign-held capital.\n\n90 | Page MQwWI",
    "Page_91": "Barriers to Entry — Licenses\n\nAccess to Licenses\n\nIn order to conduct fish farming activities in the Faroe Islands, the fish farming company must\nobtain authorisation from Heilsufradiliga Starvsstovan (The Faroese Food and Veterinary\nAuthority) to operate an aquaculture facility. The authorisation specifies certain technical\nrequirements with regard to conducting fish farming activities.\n\nFish farming companies with the above mentioned authorisation can apply for licenses to\nconduct fish farming activities from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. New sea licenses\ncan be awarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There is today a limit of 20\ncommercial seawater licenses and no limit for licenses on land. If new licenses are to be\nawarded, they may be awarded through auction.\n\nAn application for a seawater license must contain a description of the proposed operations,\nincluding a plan for complying with environmental and other applicable regulations.\n\nThe government of the Faroe Islands in April 2018 announced a new category of licenses, i.e.\ndevelopment licenses. Development licenses are intended to motivate investment in new fish\nfarming technologies. Due to the anti-trust regulations, Mowi Faroes can only obtain\n\ndevelopment licenses, as the limits regarding foreign ownership do not apply to such licenses.\n\nLicenses are granted for 12 years and are renewable for additional 12-year term. License\nholders must pay an annual fee of DKK 12,000 for each individual license.\n\nFish farming companies must also pay a harvesting fee based on the weight of gutted fish\nharvested in a month, multiplied by the average international market price in the same\nmonth.\n\nIf the average international market price is DKK 36 per kilogram or higher, the fee is 5%. If the\naverage international market price is DKK 32 per kilogram or higher, but lower than DKK 36\nper kilogram, the fee is 2,5%. If the average international market price is DKK 32 per kilogram\nor lower, the fee is 0,5%.\n\nNo fee is paid in connection with harvesting of fish that is ordered by the Chief Veterinary\nOfficer, and which cannot be sold at market price.\n\nInformation on the monthly harvesting of fish shall be reported to the tax authorities not later\nthan on the 15th day in the month following the harvest. If information on harvesting is\nsubmitted too late, a fine of DKK 1,000 will be added to the fee for the relevant month.\n\nThe harvesting fee falls due for payment in 4 instalments on 1 February, 1 May, 1 August and 1\nOctober and must be paid no later than on the 20th day in the relevant month.\n\nLicenses can be sold and pledged, and legal security is perfected by registration with the\nLand Registry. Licenses may be withdrawn in cases of material breach of conditions set out in\nthe individual license or in the aquaculture or environmental legislation.\n\n91 | Page MQwWI",

The\nsuccess of good health management practices has been demonstrated on\nmany occasions and has contributed to an overall improvement in the\nsurvival of farmed salmonids.\n\nFish health management plans, veterinary health plans, biosecurity plans, risk\nmitigation plans, contingency plans, disinfection procedures, surveillance\n\nschemes, as well as coordinated and synchronised zone/area management\napproaches, all support healthy stocks with emphasis on disease prevention.\n\nPrevention of many diseases is achieved through vaccination at an early\nstage and while the salmon are in freshwater. Vaccines are widely used\ncommercially to reduce the risk of health challenges. With the introduction of\nvaccines a considerable number of bacterial and viral health issues have\nbeen effectively controlled, with the additional benefit that the quantity of\nmedicine prescribed in the industry has been reduced.\n\nIn some instances medicinal treatment is still required to avoid mortality and\nfor the well-being and welfare of the fish. Even the best managed farms may\nhave to use medicines from time to time, if other measures are not sufficient.\nFor several viral diseases, no effective vaccines are currently available.\n\n93 | Page MQwWI",
    "Page_94": "Risk Factors\n\n12.2 Most important health risks to salmon\n\nSea lice: There are several species of sea lice, which are naturally occurring\nseawater parasites. They can infect the salmon skin and if not controlled they can\ncause lesions and secondary infection. Sea lice are controlled through good\nhusbandry and management practices, the use of lice prevention barriers (e.g.\nskirts), by submerging the salmon using Tubenet, cleaner fish (different wrasse species\nand lumpsuckers, which eat the lice off the salmon), mechanical removal systems\nand when necessary licensed medicines.\n\nCardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS): CMS is a chronic disease that can develop over\nseveral months and is caused by the piscine myocarditis virus (PMCYV). Mortality\ntypically occurs in large seawater fish. A typical disease event can last one to six\nmonths. Control is achieved mainly by good husbandry and management practices\nand keeping the fish in conditions that satisfy their biological needs for food, clean\nwater, space and habitat.\n\nPancreas Disease (PD): PD is caused by the Salmonid Alphavirus and is present in\nEurope. It is a contagious virus that can cause reduced appetite, muscle and\npancreas lesions, lethargy, and if not appropriately managed, elevated mortality. PD\naffects Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in seawater and is controlled mainly by\nmanagement and mitigation practices. Vaccination is also used in combination with\nthese measures where PD represents a risk, providing some additional level of\nprotection. In addition, selective breeding for PD-resistant fish has also contributed to\nreducing the incidence of PD.\n\nSalmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS): SRS is caused by intracellular bacteria. It\noccurs mainly in Chile but has also been observed, albeit to a much lesser extent, in\nNorway, Ireland and the UK. It causes lethargy and appetite loss, and can result in\nelevated mortality. SRS is to some extent controlled by vaccination, but medicinal\nintervention may also be required.\n\nHeart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation (HSMI): HSMI is currently reported in Norway\nand to a lesser extent Scotland. Symptoms of HSMI are reduced appetite, abnormal\nbehaviour and in most cases low mortality. HSMI generally affects fish in their first year\nin sea and control is achieved mainly by good husbandry and management\npractices.\n\nInfectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA): ISA is caused by the ISA virus and is widely\nreported. It is a contagious disease that causes lethargy and anaemia and may lead\nto significant mortality in seawater if not appropriately managed. Control of ISA is\nachieved through culling or harvesting of affected fish and the application of\nstringent biosecurity and mitigation measures. Vaccines are available and are in use\nin areas where ISA is considered to represent a risk.\n\nGill Disease (GD): GD is a general term used to describe gill conditions occurring in\nsea. The changes may be caused by different infectious agents; amoeba, virus or\nbacteria, as well as environmental factors including algae or jellyfish. Little is known\nabout the cause of many of the gill conditions and to what extent infectious or\nenvironmental factors are primary or secondary causes of disease.\n\n94| Page MQwWI",

In the\nabsence of effective vaccines, the use of antibiotics reached a maximum of\nalmost 50 tonnes in 1987. Following the introduction of effective vaccines\nagainst the main bacterial challenges of the time, the quantity of antibiotics\nused in the industry declined significantly to less than 1.4 tonnes by 1994 and\nhas since then continued to be very low. These developments, along with the\nintroduction of more strict biosecurity and health management strategies,\nallowed for further expansion of the industry and an increase in production.\n\nDuring the last two decades there has been a general stabilisation of\nmortality in Norway, Scotland and Canada, which has been\n\nachieved principally through good husbandry, good management practices\nand vaccination. The trend in the Chilean industry stems from infection\npressure from SRS, which has declined in recent years.\n\nSource: Kontali Analyse, Norsk medisinaldepot, Norwegian Institute of Public Health\n\n95 | Page MQwWI",

These are good indicators for\nmedium- and long-term harvest, while the best short-term indicator is standing\nbiomass categorised by size. As harvested size is normally above 4 kg, the\navailable biomass of this size class is therefore the best estimate of short-term\nsupply.\n\nIf no actual numbers on smolt releases are available, vaccine sales could be\na good indicator of number of smolt releases and when the smolt is put to\nsea. This is a good indicator of long-term harvest volumes as it takes up to 2\nyears smolt release to harvest.\n\nVariation in seawater temperature can materially impact the length of the\nproduction cycle. A warmer winter can for example increase harvest volumes\nfor the relevant year, partly at the expense of the subsequent year.\n\nDisease outbreaks can also impact harvest volume due to mortality and\ngrowth slowdown.\n\n98 | Page MQwWI",

Due to the\nfalling cost curve and the discounted price of small fish, the economic\noptimal harvest weight is in the area of 4-5 kg (GWT). The number of\nharvested kilograms yielded from each smolt is impacted by disease,\nmortality, temperatures, growth attributes and commercial decisions.\n\nThe average yield per smolt in Norway is estimated at 3.52 kg (GWT) for the 19\nGeneration.\n\nSince 2010, the Chilean salmon industry has been rebuilding its biomass after\nthe depletion caused by the ISA crisis which began in 2007. In 2010/11, the\nChilean salmon industry performed well on fish harvested, due to the low\ndensity of production (improved yield per smolt). In line with increased density\nin subsequent years, biological indicators deteriorated. In 2016, an algae\nbloom caused high mortality, and the Chilean salmon industry started to\nrebuild its biomass once again. Recently, the yield per smolt has improved in\nChile, and the average for 19G is estimated at 4.04 kg (GWT).\n\nAverage yield in the UK, North America and Faroe Islands for 18G is estimated\nat 3.17kg, 3.75kg and 4.37kg, respectively.\n\nSource: Kontali Analyse, Mowi\n\n99 | Page MQwWI",

The Norwegian industry is focused on minimising natural\nfluctuations as license constraints put a limit on how much biomass can be in\nsea at the peak of the year.\n\nIn Chile the situation is different due to its more stable seawater temperature\nand opposite seasons (being in the Southern hemisphere). A more consistent\nwater temperature allows for smolt release throughout the year and enables\nmore uniform utilisation of facilities.
