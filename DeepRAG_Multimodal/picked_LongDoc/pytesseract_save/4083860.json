Have you been required to work remotely/from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic? | Yes No\n\nd. Have you been shielding? Yes, for myself [_] Yes, fora member of my household  [_]No\nThe charts on the following pages show the breakdown of theme scores for staff answering ‘yes’ to each of these questions, compared with the results\nfor all staff at your organisation. Results are presented in the context of the highest, average and lowest scores for similar organisations.\n\nComparing your data\n\nTo improve overall comparability, the data have been weighted to match the occupation group profile of staff at your organisation to that of the\nbenchmarking group, as in previous charts. However, there may be differences in the occupation group profiles of the individual COVID-19 subgroups.\nFor example, the mix of occupational groups across redeployed staff at your organisation may differ from similar organisations. This difference would\nnot be accounted for by the weighting and therefore may affect the comparability of results. As such, a degree of caution is advised when interpreting\nyour results.\n\nFurther information\n\nResults for these groups of staff, including data for individual questions, are also available via the online dashboards. Please note that results presented\nin these dashboards have not been weighted where no benchmarking takes place and so may vary slightly from those shown in this report.\n\n \n\nHANDS FACE SPACE 18",

This change\nhas been applied retrospectively so data for 2016-2020 shown in this table are comparable. However, these figures are not directly comparable to the results reported in previous\nyears.
