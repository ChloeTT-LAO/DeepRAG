Adherents of both\n\nProtestantism and Deism sought a “Christian society,” and while revolutionaries drew from both\nbiblical Reformation and secular Enlightenment thought, much of the latter was biblical thought\nin secular form. Ministers employed the Bible extensively to support the Revolution. This\nrelative theological consensus encouraged religious practice and a political system that\naccommodated dispute. Human rights were secure thanks to man’s subordinate position under\nGod. Even after much secularization, the state has protected the religious rights of groups and\nparents. America has enjoyed consistent political freedom and stability as well as unparalleled\neconomic and military strength.\n\nIn pre-revolutionary France, the Catholic Church suppressed Reformation thought and\nbound itself to the monarchy. Voltaire and Mme du Chatelet insisted the Bible was not to be\ntrusted. Rousseau replaced God with an absolute notion of Reason. Cabanis replaced religion\nwith “scientific” ideology. The results were severe anticlericalism and a militant form of\nsecularism known as Jaicité. The Cult of Reason predicted unanimity, and the Cult of the\nNation transformed liberty into conformity with Reason. Instead of limiting power, the French\nconsolidated it and swerved between failed attempts at republicanism and either empire or\nrestored monarchy. Economically, capitalism came later and remained weaker. French\nreligious policy has restricted both religious groups and individual public practice.\n\nThe research indicates that biblical influence in a society is the greatest guarantor of\n\nliberty, economic prosperity, and freedom of practice for all religions.",
    "Page_6": "INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the last century-and-a-half, the United States has experienced a secularization of\nculture and society. Differing opinions over the intended nature and proper expression of the\nseparation of church and state have led to contentious debates over the role of the Bible and\nassociated icons and themes in government, schools, public grounds, and even the practices of\ndeployed military personnel. As a result, not only biblical ethics and morals, but also biblical\nmetaphysical assertions are increasingly excluded from public discourse in favor of what some\nconsider a more “objective” secular philosophy.\n\nIf, however, the philosophical assertions of the Bible are responsible for the positive\npolitical and economic outcomes in the United States, and if the corresponding modernist\nphilosophical assumptions behind the French Revolution were responsible for their rapid\ndevolution to the Reign of Terror and authoritarian rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, then the\nsecularization of American society could have disastrous results.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to explore and compare the fruits of modernity (including\npostmodernism) with those of biblical Christianity. In particular, this thesis will compare the\nphilosophical presuppositions behind modernity (atheism, naturalism, materialism, and\nreductionism) to the philosophical presuppositions promoted in the Bible (theism,\nsupernaturalism, and the importance of biblical revelation). The ultimate hope is to compare the\nrelative historical fruits of the Bible and modernity throughout the modern era, roughly the last\nfive centuries. Because philosophies bear “fruit” through historical events, the object of study\ncan include many revolutionary changes in society (in a broad sense—not strictly “revolutionary\nwars”). The scope could, therefore, include events in Reformation Germany, the English Civil\n\nWar, the Glorious “Bloodless” Revolution, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the",

Unfortunately, this is far\ntoo broad for the scope of a single thesis.\n\nThis comparison will, therefore, focus on the American and French Revolutions, first\nidentifying the fundamental philosophical underpinnings that each Revolution built on, then\ncomparing the outcomes of each Revolution, and finally attempting to identify whether there\nmay be a causal relationship between the philosophical assumptions and the revolutionary\n\noutcomes.",
    "Page_8": "CHAPTER 1 - “Secular” Thought\nBefore analyzing the American and French Revolutions, it is important to define and\nanalyze terms clearly. In particular, most such analyses of both Revolutions revolve around\ndegrees of secularism, so any fair comparison requires a clear understanding of the concept and\nits variations. Unfortunately, secularism is often misunderstood and sometimes vilified. It is\nnot, after all, a mere “absence of religion” any more than it is a “lack of religion.” It is actually\n\nmuch more difficult to define.!\n\nEarly History of Secular Thought\n\nThe history of secular thought is far longer than many realize, and it is also more closely\ntied to Christianity than one might think based on debates over the topic. It may be said to have\nits roots in the Greek philosophical schools. During the Socratic era, intellectual thought first\nbegan to pull away from conventional religious thought, and an “antagonism” developed\n“between natural philosophy and religion.”? Subsequent to this, two personalities stood out for\nhaving done much to establish secular thought. The first was Augustine of Hippo; the second,\nThomas Aquinas.\n\nIn the 5\" century, Augustine tackled difficult questions of political and religious theory in\nan age where Christians--many of whom had expected Jesus to return by that time--were\nstruggling to determine how best to live in the world while awaiting His return. In his analysis,\nAugustine established a distinction between the City of God (God’s perfect kingdom to come,\n\nfor which the church prepares humanity) and the City of Man (the province of the state and\n\n' Craig Calhoun, \"Rethinking Secularism,\" The Hedgehog Review 12, no. 3 (2010): 35, accessed July 10,\n2016, http://ezproxy. liberty.edu:2048.\n\n?

He never intended, however, to “banish religion from ‘secular’ affairs.”\nRather, he reflected on 1) Jesus's command to \"give to Caesar\" and 2) Paul's command to honor\nGod-ordained authorities in view of the fact that Rome had been sacked and Jesus had not yet\nreturned.\n\nThe sacking of Rome in 410 CE was a traumatic event similar to the 2001 attacks on the\nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon in impact to the psyche. Both events ushered in new and\ninnovative thought on politics and security. Since the prevailing world order was collapsing and\nJesus had not yet returned, Augustine sought to identify how Christians were to regard the state’s\nauthority. His dualism was more between the love of God and love of self than it was between\nchurch and state,* but it certainly made room for the latter. As a result, Jesus’s teachings, Paul’s\napplication of them, and Augustine’s interpretations of both all combined to make room for a\n“secular” state separate from the Church.\n\nDuring the 13\" century, eight centuries after Augustine and only a short time after the\nzenith of Roman Catholic power, Thomas Aquinas served as a priest, Dominican friar,\ntheologian, and philosopher. Because he introduced (or perhaps “‘re-introduced”) Aristotle’s\nwritings to European culture and philosophy,* he did much to lay the foundation for later\nRenaissance and Enlightenment thought. An entire philosophical school, known as Thomism,\narose from his work, and one of his presuppositions was that “truth” was to be accepted, no\nmatter the source. The philosophical problem, of course, is how one defines or confirms the\nveracity of any claim to truth. Because of his assertion, European intellectuals and theologians\n\nelevated the Socratic philosophers to a plane equal to the Apostles and the Scriptures.\n\n3 Calhoun, \"Rethinking Secularism,\" 38.\n\n4 Emmet Kennedy, \"The Tangled History of Secularism,\" Modern Age 42, no. 1 (Winter, 2000): 32,\naccessed July 9, 2016, http://ezproxy.liberty.edu:2048.\n\n> Kennedy, \"The Tangled History of Secularism,\" 32.",
    "Page_10": "Another of Aquinas’s contributions was a “distinction between reason and faith” based\non the writings of an Andalusian, Islamic philosopher, Abu Walid Muhammad bin Ahmad bin\nRushd, whose name is often Latinized as Averroes. Because of this distinction between reason\nand faith, subsequent philosophers presupposed them to be antithetical, rather than\ncomplementary.® In a real sense, then, Averroes and Aquinas laid the foundation for\nKierkegaard’s later concept of “blind faith,” a conflation of faith with the postmodern\nabandonment of reason.\n\nWith Aquinas, the distinction between sacred and secular took a specific philosophical\nturn. Augustine had made room for secular institutions of state distinct from the Church,\nsomething Christians were already accustomed to since the Church had grown under “pagan”\nRoman rule. Aquinas forced the distinction further, making the Church the province of faith\napart from reason, and the state the province of reason apart from faith. This made room for\ntruth-claims within the Church that no longer required the support of reason, and it likewise\nmade room for truth claims in the state that could be completely antithetical to Scripture.\n\nAs time went on, modern philosophers concluded God could not be apprehended through\nreason or rationalism. “The world was secularized in that morality, religion, and politics were\nexcluded from rational analysis and nature was mechanized.” In fact, the growing body of\nsecular thought began to turn against its religious roots. Even the “atheists of classical antiquity”\nbegan to offer a “naturalistic explanation for the origins of religion--an attitude that persists in\n\nthe critique of theism.”®\n\n© Keulman, Review of Western Atheism, 578.\nT Kennedy, \"The Tangled History of Secularism,\" 34.\n8 Keulman, Review of Western Atheism, 578.",
    "Page_11": "Secularism and Political Theory\n\nBy the time of the Renaissance (14th and 15th centuries), atheistic and agnostic\nspeculation that had previously been “at odds with ecclesiastical institutions” found expression,\nand modern political theory (the thoughts of the writers who inspired the American and French\nRevolutions) began to take form. Some regard Machiavelli, for example, as “a potent source” of\natheism, particularly in his separation of moral virtue (especially of the sovereign) from Christian\nthought or anthropology.? While Machiavelli was no friend to modern democratic thought, he\nset the stage for it by reminding his pupil, Lorenzo de Medici, that the people can collectively\nturn on a prince. In a real sense, then, even “subjects” have some say in their own government.\nIn terms of religious thought, however, Machiavelli (and to a lesser extent, Thomas Hobbes),\nconcluded religion was not useful in the political sphere.!° For Machiavelli, a truly Christian\nmorality would only weaken a prince and therefore undermine his power. He reasoned that\nimmoral (or at least amoral) actions on the part of a prince could serve the moral purpose of\npromoting security.\n\nBy the 17\" century, even more overtly Christian writings further developed thought on\nthe relationship between church and state, sacred and secular. John Locke developed a\nsecularized version of Richard Hooker’s expressly Protestant Christian philosophy. Like\nHooker, Locke concluded the government should not establish a religion (though he almost\ncertainly presupposed any “religion” would be a Christian one).'! This form of secular thought\nsought to keep the state out of the Church, so to speak, without preventing the latter from\n\ninfluencing the former.

The “pluralism of society” required some kind of “neutrality, or ‘principled distance’”\non the part of the state.!”\n\nBy this time, then, at least two distinct visions of “secularism” developed--one that made\na distinction between church and state and another that divorced them completely. One obvious\nreason was the increasing development of atheistic thought in clear opposition to various\nexpressions of theism. A second reason stemmed from the two opposing historical events that\nfollowed the Renaissance. The 16\" century saw the Protestant Reformation in northern Europe,\nwhich split the reformers from Vatican authority. The 17\" century then saw a resurgence of\n\nspeculative (and often atheistic) thought in the Enlightenment.\n\nSecularism and Progress\nA common thread worthy of analysis among these historical movements is progress.\n\nSeveral societies have each seen impressive scientific movements, for example, but unlike the\nmodern scientific movement in the West, they did not persist. Some fell victim to the fatalism\ninherent to their worldview of continuity between humanity, divinity, and nature. If nature is\nsubject to the whims of the gods, who in turn are both enslaved to their natural roles and at least\noccasionally responsive to human manipulation, there is no room for objective science. Another\nsuch scientific movement fell victim to the fatalism inherent to Islamic doctrine. Since Islam\ncalls for mankind to accept both good and evil from Allah without question, since there is no\nexpress promise of salvation in the Qur’an, and since Allah had changed His mind more than\n\nonce about critical matters (leading to the doctrine of abrogation), there could be no optimistic\n\n'2 Charles Taylor, “The Meaning of Secularism,” The Hedgehog Review (Institute for Advanced Studies in\nCulture), (Fall, 2010): 23, accessed June 30, 2016, http://iasc-culture.org/THR/archives/Fall2010/Taylor_lo.pdf.",

While the Renaissance had seen impressive scientific development, by the end of\nhis life, even Leonardo da Vinci had abandoned scientific inquiry for art.\n\nReformation thought took science to new heights. The greatest leap forward came with\nthe Reformation figure, Isaac Newton, whose book, Principia Mathematica, laid the\nphilosophical foundation for modern science. Newton built on a realist epistemology that\nembraced objective reality (and therefore, objective truth), as well as the subject-object\ndistinction. Both of these stemmed directly from the biblical theology of the transcendent God,\nas well as from the optimism that resulted from salvation by grace. If God is eternal and\nunchanging, if He expresses Himself both spiritually and naturally, and if His (spiritual) Word\nleads to spiritual redemption and salvation, then His natural work in creation may also be\nunderstood and its challenges overcome. As a result, scientific progress surged forward.\n\nEnlightenment thinkers built on Newton’s foundation, but they transposed the realist\nepistemology from its theological foundation to a naturalist, materialist base. Scientific\n“progress” continued but without its metaphysical foundation. Eventually, science became\nobjectified as the sole, reliable source of knowledge, and its theological foundations were\nrelegated to the “irrational” realm of faith. Enlightenment thought came to contrast reason to\n“unenlightened versions of faith,” and many committed to “comprehensive rationality, the\nsupremacy not just of logic and empirical research but also of systematic, thorough, and\nexclusive reliance on them.”!?

    "Page_14": "Not only did technical, scientific progress find its way from a Reformation base to a\nmaterialistic one, but also the Reformation’s eschatological, millenarian view of history.\nReformation theologians looked to a utopian future with Christ’s return, and with the\nReformation, they began to see impressive technical and social improvements. Enlightenment\nthinkers likewise embraced a “secular millenarian” view of the future that embodied humanistic\nnotions of progress on a materialistic base, liberated from the social restraints of theology.\nEnlightenment philosophers “encouraged independent social behavior” by first emphasizing a\nhope that change would necessarily mean progress or improvement. Here, instead of being a\nproduct of careful thought and hard work, progress became an inevitable result of change. This\nmade room for all manner of nihilistic, revolutionary thought because even destructive change\nwas expected to bring “progress.” Second, they emphasized a hope in a “utopian ethic” that\nwould lead to “technical progress to satisfy physical needs, moral progress to lessen violence,\n[and] political progress towards freedom, equality, and justice.”!> By the 19\" century, this\ntheory of progress found bold expression in Marx’s restatement of the Hegelian dialectic: that\nany conflict between “thesis” and “antithesis” necessarily led to the development of a higher\n“synthesis.”\n\nBy the time of the Revolutionary Era (for purposes of this paper, from 1776 to 1804,\nwhen Napoleon became emperor), not only was there unprecedented scientific progress but also\nthere was economic and political progress. Adam Smith began with a biblical notion of\nstewardship of property and constructed a rational argument for liberal economic theory.

It was the different theories of progress,\nhowever--biblical vs. humanistic--that led to the widest divergence in where this progress led.\nWhere the prevailing theory of progress was more humanistic and “inevitable,” the “gulf\nbetween the ideal and reality” in capitalism (that is, its uneven economic outcomes) led some\ntheorists to advocate “going beyond” capitalism to socialism to overcome the gulf. “It is in this\n\nspirit that both Nazism and Communism can be referred to as ‘secular religions.’”!”\n\nSecularism and “Civic Religion”\nThis leads to another component of secular thought worthy of analysis--the idea of civic\nreligion. As Dr. Mark Cladis, Brown University professor of Religious studies, put it:\n\nBenjamin Franklin endorsed a civil “Publick Religion” to inculcate civic virtue while at\nthe same time he opposed any state-sponsored traditional religion. And not long before\nthe French Revolution, Rousseau condemned “blood thirsty,” nationalistic traditional\nreligions even as he advocated an enforceable civil religion with tolerance as its\ncenterpiece. !®\n\nJames Madison is said to have interpreted Luther’s doctrine of the two kingdoms, civil\n\nand spiritual (an apparent restatement of Augustine’s thesis), as “an account of the separation of\n\n‘6 Bauberot, \"Secularism and French Religious Liberty,” 458.\n\n\"7 Thid., 457\n'8 Mark Cladis, “Religion, Secularism, and Democratic Culture,” The Good Society 19, no. 2 (2010): 22,\naccessed June 30, 2016, http://www. jstor.org/stable/10.5325/goodsociety. 19.2.0022.\n\n10",
    "Page_16": "church and state.”!? Of course, “Americans have passionately argued over the meaning and\nutility of the Wall of Separation.””° A critical part of this discussion was the development of a\n“civil or political religion,” which, unlike confessional or traditional religion, “has the\nsociological and psychological form of traditional religion (enduring beliefs and practices,\npowerful ideas and symbols, tutored passions and emotions) but...does not have the traditionally\nreligious content.\"?!\n\nCladis refers to this as “civic religion” and defines it similarly as those aspects of a\ngroup’s civic life that take on the “sociological and psychological form of religion (deep beliefs\nand practices, ideas, and symbols, for example) without necessarily having any traditionally\nreligious content.\"22\n\nWhat is noteworthy for discussion here is that both the American Revolution and the\nFrench Revolution involved establishing some form of civic religion. This was not necessarily\nmeant to supplant or displace confessional religion, but rather to prevent historical excesses such\nas the British Puritan Interregnum or even Calvin’s reign in Geneva. As such, most do not\nregard civic religion as “dangerous.” Rather, “democratic civil religions offer protection from\n\ntotalitarian and theocratic religion, among other varieties of antidemocratic movements.””?\n\nSecularization Theories (the Secularization Hypothesis)\nThis analysis has already shown that two overarching visions of secularism were\ndeveloped throughout history.

The second grew from a materialistic restatement of the Protestant\nview of progress, based instead on a humanistic belief in the inevitability of progress, whether\nsocial, economic, or political.\n\nThe second vision commonly found expression in “secularization theories.” For\nexample, Bauberot states this in mild form when he asserts that a society becomes “secularized”\nwhen there is “(1) a decrease in the portion of wealth devoted to the ‘supernatural’, (2) an\nincreased independence of social behaviors from religion, linked to the idea that social practices\nchange living conditions, and (3) an increasing justification of institutions functioning with little\nor no tie to religion.”*4\n\nSometimes they are more explicit. Bauberot defines four stages of “secularism”:\n\n1) [A]appropriation of ecclesiastical goods by the civil state. For example, the Protestant\n\nReformation saw this in the German Empire. Also, the French Revolution saw the sale of\n\nRoman Catholic properties;\n\n2) “The rise of the “soft” human sciences, secularization theories, and the \"paradox of\n\noutcomes,\" that capitalism (a fruit of religious thought) tends to pull people away from\n\nreligion”;\n\n3) “the process [in the third quarter of the 20\" Century] by which the sectors of society\n\nand culture are freed from the authority of religious institutions and symbols”; and\n\n4) “a more common, or ‘vulgar,’ vision of secularization [that] has made religion a sort of\n\nrelic, destined to disappear sooner or later as the world's diverse societies proceed to\n\nmodernity. 7°\n\nThis “vulgar” vision is secularization theory, which builds on the humanistic vision of\nprogress and therefore assumes that religion is a “fad” that will pass away as people become\n\nmore enlightened. Bauberot notes that this fourth stage has proven to be wrong, for the turn of\n\nthe last millennium turned out to be “furiously religious.” Forces of “counter-secularization,”\n\n24 Bauberot, “Secularism and French Religious Liberty,” 453.\n25 Tbid., 452-4.\n6 Thid.\n\n12",

According to this approach, the\nmere thought of religion in politics leads to fear and suspicion, so advocates “pursue aggressive\nlaicité or secularism and keep all religion out of political life.”\n\nThe dark side of this approach is that, in the defense of liberalism, people must employ\nwhat Cladis refers to as “illiberal means” to achieve “privatization of religion.” By forcing\nreligion into the corner, advocates of this model also rob society of a priceless source of values,\nbecause “religious perspectives potentially have much to contribute to shared moral and political\n\nprojects of nations and global communities.”*4\n\nSecularism: The Two Models\n\nWhile some of the historical events analyzed here occurred much later than either\nrevolution compared in this paper, they provide valuable insight into the philosophical\nfoundations behind them--foundations that existed during the Revolutionary Era. The two\noverarching models of secularism are therefore clear.\n\nThe first model followed a line of reasoning from Augustine to the Reformation. It\npermitted (and eventually encouraged) a distinction between church and state. It grew from a\nview of progress based on a Protestant Millenarian view of history in which God is working\nprovidentially in and through society toward a culmination in the Millennial Kingdom of Christ.\n\n> Ibid.\n\n3 Tbid., 24.\n4 Tbid., 23-24.\n\n14",

According to\nBauberot, this “secularism in the good sense” entailed three ideal features:\n\n1) when participating in the public and political realms, citizens do not normally assume\n\nthat others necessarily share their religious perspectives or perspectives on religion;\n\n2) citizens do not treat religious perspectives in public debate as a special case subject to\n\nspecial exclusion or special privilege; and\n\n3) government neither officially sponsors nor hinders religion, upholding the First\n\nAmendment. The first two features of secularism (in the good sense) pertain to\n\nconstraints on citizens, and the third on government.*®\n\nThe second model of secularism followed a line of reasoning through Thomas Aquinas to\na complete distinction between “reason” and “faith.” Because it made room for truth claims in\nreligion that are independent of reason and truth claims in the state that are antithetical to\nreligion, it ultimately divorced the state from the church entirely. This “aggressive secularism”\nbuilt on a set of atheistic or agnostic philosophical presuppositions: atheism (or Deism--in either\ncase for which God is considered irrelevant to modern history), naturalism (the presupposition\nthat the natural realm constitutes the whole of the universe), and materialism (the philosophy that\nholds to the existence of a physical, material explanation for all phenomena, including that which\nappears to be immaterial). Adherents of this view developed a materialistic restatement of the\nProtestant view of progress, based instead on a humanistic belief in the inevitability of progress,\nwhether social, economic, or political, a view that made room for nihilistic views of conflict and\nprogress.\n\nThis “secularism in the bad sense” is characterized by three beliefs:\n\n35 Bauberot, \"Secularism and French Religious Liberty,” 454.\n3 Cladis, “Religion, Secularism, and Democratic Culture,” 23-24.\n\n15",

These three positions presuppose a narrow,\n\nparochial view of religion....>”\n\nThis model of aggressive secularism moved beyond notions of privatizing religion “for\nthe sake of a pact of nonaggression” to a view that “religion is a destructive, superstitious relic of\nthe past that has no place in modernity.” It holds tightly to the secularization hypothesis (despite\nevidence to the contrary) in the belief that in the modern age, humans are “enlightened and freed\nfrom the shackles of religion.” The assertion is clear: “Secularism is the essence of modernity\nand religion is the antithesis of all that is modern.”3* Cladis called it “the ugly sense of\nsecularism.”*?\n\nThe extent to which either of these models affected the American and French Revolutions\nwill become apparent in the next two sections.

Some see it as a completely secular\nendeavor, while others see it as the product of Divine Providence. For example, James S.\nValliant, an author who proposes Roman emperors “invented” Christianity, asserts: “The\nFounders were men of the Enlightenment,” the “defining characteristic” for which “was man's\napplication of reason to every concern.”! He sees in the Enlightenment a clear sequence of\nthought from 1) Aquinas’s reintroduction of Aristotle “into a world dominated by unadulterated\nChristianity for more than a millennia [sic]” (the “era of the Scholastics’), to 2) the Renaissance,\n(“the Rebirth of Reason”), and finally to 3) the Enlightenment.” Notably, he appears to discount\nany influence on the Enlightenment from the intervening historical event: the Reformation.\nAfter claiming the American Revolution was a product of the Enlightenment, he continues, “The\nadvancements of the Enlightenment were driven not by faith-based theology but by observation-\nbased rationality.”> Alex McCrossen, professor of history at Southern Methodist University,\nnotes that a 1967 “classic” text by Bernard Bailyn on the Revolution contains “many references\nto Rome, a couple to Greece, and none to the Old or New Testament.”* According to\nMcCrossen, in the years to follow the publication of Bailyn’s text, historians tended to focus on\n“how familiarity with ancient history and the classics informed American political and artistic\n\nculture.”°\n\n‘ys, Valliant, “The New Testament versus the American Revolution,” The Objective Standard, 10, no. 2,\n(Summer 2015): 36, accessed August 7, 2016, http://ezproxy.liberty.edu:2048.\n2a:\nIbid., 37.\n3 Ibid., 36.\n4 Alex McCrossen, “American Zion: The Old Testament as a Political Text from the Revolution to the\nCivil War,” Journal Of The Early Republic 33, no. 4 (Winter 2013): 771, accessed August 7, 2016.

Again, Jefferson is\nthe typical case in question. He was attracted both to moral rationalism--which, according to\nJohn Locke, “held that political conclusions can be inferred from self-evident premises”--and\nScottish moral sense philosophy, which held that we sense and feel--not infer--moral values.>°\nThese are the ideas from which philosophers derived natural law, an ambiguous concept to\nmodern ears. In his review of Morton White’s Philosophy of the American Revolution, J.R. Pole\nprovides a helpful definition:\n\nNatural law differs from physical law because the decision to be bound by natural law\n\ninvolves free choice. A fire cannot choose not to burn; but a man can choose not to do his\n\nduty, just as he may choose not to exercise his right. A man may even choose not to be\nguided by the evidence of his senses: but no one else can make that choice for him\nbecause no one can experience the evidence of another's senses. That is why natural\nrights cannot be alienated, that is, voluntarily made over for another to exercise or to\nrefrain from exercising.”\n\nThe source of natural law is the question, and the term leaves room for readers to assume\neither Divine or natural origins. There is little doubt of Locke’s influence on Jefferson’s view of\nmorality and natural law. While conventional wisdom holds that Jefferson most likely read\nLocke's Second Treatise before the Declaration of Independence, some contest this. Even so, the\nlate Harvard Professor Morton White contends in his pivotal work, The Philosophy of the\n\nAmerican Revolution, that Jefferson's language--self-evident truths, inalienable rights, laws of\n\nnature, and man's essence, for example--betrays a heavy influence by the writings of Swiss jurist\n\n56 W.

The result, rather than suppression\nof faith, was to create what some called a “sort of marketplace of religions.””” An ironic result is\nthat the American separation of church and state “has been conducive to high levels of religious\nbelief and participation.”’® The goal of American “state neutrality” has been “to avoid favoring\nor disfavoring not just religious positions, but any basic position, religious or nonreligious.”\nIndeed, Marx's later condemnation of American society was telling.

Because the French Revolution\nfollowed quickly on the heels of the American Revolution, the two events are often compared as\nif they stemmed from similar ideologies. The differences, however, are much greater than the\nsimilarities. The American Revolution, for instance, was a mere “secession” from England. The\nFrench Revolution, on the other hand, was a true insurgent rebellion that led to a complete power\nchange (several, in fact). What is more, in the American Revolution, the Constitution, once\nwritten, was never to be replaced, “unlike the repeated French efforts to establish a desirable and\nlasting version,” and the king, once rejected, was never to be replaced by another.”\n\nWhat caused the French Revolution is the subject of hot debate: “At present, no\ncomprehensive explanation for the coming of the Revolution exists...[and] it is unlikely that one\nwill emerge.’ This thesis, however, is not a quest to explain the origins of the Revolution, but\n\ninstead, to explore the worldview(s) the revolutionaries embraced.\n\nTop-Down, not Bottom-Up\nOrigins of the Revolution are therefore of concern only insofar as they demonstrate\nideology.

While Marxism would have predicted a “bottom-up” revolutionary\nprogression in France from feudalism to capitalism (before progressing inevitably to socialism\nand communism), others note that this did not happen.

As Professor Hugh Ragsdale of the University of Alabama\nwrote of Rousseau’s influence, “Everything depended fundamentally on politics, and... no\npeople could ever be anything but what the nature of its government made it.”'! Because\nRousseau saw politics, instead of religion or custom, as the basis for society, “the character of a\npeople depended on the nature of its government....”!?

Both Christians and Deists appealed to the Bible for inspiration and support. As a\nresult, not only were the outcomes of the American and French revolutions different but\nstructurally they were very different events. In the American colonies, for example, the British\naristocracy had not secured a great deal of status in terms of rank. Rather, the elite grew more as\na meritocracy. According to Dr. Leonard J. Hochberg’s analysis of Alexis de Tocqueville’s\nwork, “the American Revolution was not a great social revolution as was the French, but merely\na political revolution,” in which the American elite (New England “commercial elite” and\nSouthern slave-owners) were better able to lead because of having no “secured privileges.”! As\nthis paper will demonstrate further below, this structural difference helped preserve liberty.\nBased on Tocqueville’s observations, Hochberg noted, “whereas the French revolutionaries\ndestroy[ed] the aristocracy and ultimately weaken[ed] liberty, the American political elite, after\n\nthe revolution, proceed[ed] to found a government in which liberty would be preserved.””\n\nAmerica’s “Relative Theological Consensus”\nTocqueville further noted a stark contrast between American debates and those in the\nFrench National Assembly.

Tocqueville also noted American\n“self-interest” was “enlightened” by an “eternal perspective.” As Hochberg put it, “According to\nTocqueville, the doctrine ‘self-interest rightly understood’ suggests to Americans that virtuous\nacts are conducive primarily to one’s own happiness, utility or ultimate profit — either in this life\nor ‘to earn the blessings of a future state.””* As he put it, “[Americans] show with complacency\nhow an enlightened regard for themselves constantly prompts them to assist each other, and\ninclines them willingly to sacrifice a portion of their time and property to the welfare of the\nState.”>\n\nTocqueville also noted that the American doctrine of what he described as “self-interest\nrightly understood” is not sufficient to produce virtue. In acknowledging this, he indicated the\nexistence of another source of virtue. According to Tocqueville: “By itself [this doctrine] ...\ncannot suffice to make a man virtuous, but it disciplines a number of citizens in habits of\nregularity, temperance, moderation, foresight, [and] self-command.”°\n\nWhat made such “calm” negotiations possible? What inspired such “enlightened” and\neven selfless “self-interest”? Tocqueville alluded to it by noting the eternal perspective in “the\nblessings of a future state,” so one possibility to be explored in the concluding material of this\npaper is the presence of the Bible as a cultural influence.

Rather, they expected debate, and lots of it.\nThis played out in a different notion of liberty. “American liberty, in contrast [to the\nFrench definition], emphasized the triumph of individual freedom and local government over\nnational destiny.” Recognizing the futility of seeking complete consensus and unanimity,\nAmericans “recognized conflict among citizens as inherent in freedom itself.”!> In fact, the\nBible’s presence in American society helped to restrain liberty in a unique way.

Dr. Adam Seligman of Boston University notes “just\nhow indebted modern ideas of individual rights are to religious principles.”!* These rights\n“spring not from man but from God and Nature.”!° Put another way, “individual rights in\nAmerica were not derived solely from positive law, but had acquired a transcendent justification\nunique in the modern world.’”° Freedom of conscience in America “draws its legitimacy from a\nset of religious precepts and orientations, decidedly not from the idea of the individual as\nautonomous moral actor.””!\n\nWhile this is not uncontested today, the foundation for rights stemmed from the idea that\n“the individual moral agent is not autonomous but subnomous (that is, under divine\ninjunctions).””?

Moore\nsummarizes it well:\n\nThe French, in laws adopted in 1881 and 1882, before the 1905 law, set up secular public\nschools that were intended to take from the Catholic Church its monopoly control over\nFrench education. The same series of laws that ended religious instruction in the state\nschools also dissolved the Jesuits, abolished chaplains in the French military, and\nremoved nuns from their role in hospitals.!*3\n\n148 Moore, “Common Principles, Different Histories, 471.\n149 Thid., 472.\n\n'50 Thid.\n\n'5] Tid, 459,\n\n'S2 Thid.\n\n'53 Thid., 473.\n\n90",

Gey summarizes the French position on religion and education with five\npoints: 1) religious liberty is “an individual rather than a group phenomenon,” 2) public\neducation seeks “to introduce students to a world of ideas and experiences to which the students\nmay not have access in their home or community environment--even if that exposure potentially\nundercuts the students’ religious training,” 3) religious liberty of students is clearly distinguished\nfrom that of their parents, 4) public education is responsible for protecting students--even young\nchildren--from “the subtly coercive group dynamics of religious communities,” and 5) separation\nof church and state means the government is a strictly secular domain, which means “to preserve\nthe structure of religious liberty for everyone, religion must be consigned to the private\n\nsector.”!64\n\nModern Challenges\n\nIn today’s Fifth Republic, France has struggled to cope with three forces: globalization\n\n(and a resultant loss of sovereignty), consumerism, and immigration.'® The French have not\n\n162 Thid., 62.\n163 Thid., 63.\n164 Thid., 78.\n165 Bauberot, \"Secularism and French Religious Liberty,” 463.\n\n92",

Despite France’s hope that this would protect Muslim girls, response to\nthe law outside of France was generally negative.\n\nAnother challenge has been women’s’ rights.

    "Page_100": "CHAPTER 6 - Analysis\n\nThe research shows that the ideological underpinnings of the American and French\nRevolutions were vastly different. The ideology behind the American Revolution was a\ncombination of biblical Reformation thought and Enlightenment thought in a cultural milieu rich\nwith biblical influence. The ideology behind the French Revolution, on the other hand, was a\nmuch purer form of Enlightenment thought that included a nearly wholesale rejection of the\nBible. As noted in the previous two chapters, the outcomes for both nations were equally\ndifferent. This has led James Livesey to conclude “the relationship between the French\nRevolution and the history of democracy, which had once seemed so vital, is now highly\ncontested.”!\n\nThis is not to assert ideological determinism.’ After all, the “precise causal significance\nof ideas” in events like these revolutions is an “intriguing problem.” Still, ideas do matter.\nDavid Wilsford of Université de Paris and University of California, San Diego has posited that\nstructural explanations are insufficient. Instead, he proposes that ideas serve as a critical\n“intervening variable” between the realities that precede a revolution and the event itself.4. Mary\nNolan, professor of history at New York University, notes the impact of particular ideas in\nrevolutionary France: “By the mid-1790s, the French who still supported the revolution were\nshaping and being shaped by the ideas debated in the sections and clubs, by the symbolism and\n\nvision of the revolutionary celebrations, and by...iconography....”°\n\n| Livesey, “The Limits of Terror: the French Revolution, Rights and Democratic Transition,” 64.\n?

    "Page_101": "Instead of ideological determinism, then, the author of this paper concludes there are\ncertainly “ideological propensities.” There can be little doubt that a major factor in the widely\ndivergent outcomes of the American and French Revolutions is the ubiquitous presence of the\nBible in pre-revolutionary American society, as well as in the centuries that have followed, and\nits near absence in French society. As Chaya Halberstam asserts, “biblical religion’ serves in\nmany ways as a precursor to, and a source of, our own democratic and egalitarian ideals.”® If\nthis is true, the corollary may also be true: that the absence of the Bible retarded democratic\ndevelopment in France. The French experiment all too often led not to what Tocqueville\ndescribed in America as “democracy to the profit of its citizens,” but rather it led to “democratic\npathology: despotism.”\n\nModernity has been in conflict with the biblical worldview since the Renaissance, and\ncertainly since the Counter-Reformation and Enlightenment. Mary Nolan, professor of history at\nNew York University, identifies a commonality in states with “high modernist schemes,” a term\nshe borrows from political scientist and anthropologist James C. Scott.’ “These states, which\nhave come in communist, fascist, and democratic variants, share a set of assumptions about\nknowledge, progress, science, and society that can be harnessed to a variety of different\nideological projects” (emphasis mine).? What's more, in their modernist nature, these states\n“greatly increase the possibility that violence will be considered legitimate and necessary, even\nprogressive.”!° She continues:\n\nThese assumptions and commitments can produce distinctly modern forms of violence\nthat are rationally planned and executed and then legitimated, in terms of both the\n\n6 Chaya Halberstam, “Created Equal: How the Bible Broke with Ancient Political Thought,” Biblical\nInterpretation 18, no. 4/5 (October 2010), 422.\n\n7 Wilsford, “The ‘Conjoncture’ of Ideas and Interests,” 358.\n\n8 Nolan, “Ideology, Mobilization, and Comparison,” 553.\n\n° Ibid.\n\n'0 Ibid.\n\n96",

These are forms of violence for which vengeance and religion do not\nprovide a satisfactory explanation, for this is the dark side of modernity that is rooted in\nmodernity, not in the persistence of Old Regime beliefs, elites, and institutions.!!\nThe justification of violence that stemmed from these modernist ideas also extended into\nimperial exercise: “In the name of science, market rationality, productivism, and progress, they\nhave imposed expert knowledge over local knowledge in their efforts to reshape nature and\nsociety along modernist lines.”!? The results of modernist imperialism have also often been\nviolent.\n\nIt is important to note that these comparisons are specifically for institutional violence,\nnot personal violence, as exemplified by the Terror and later by the Stalinist purges and the\nFascist Holocaust, all events deriving from modernist ideals. While the numbers related to the\nTerror are comparatively small, the ideological propensity of modernism for institutional\nviolence is clear.\n\nNot only were ideas important, but also matters of character related to divergent ideas of\nmoral subordination to God or complete individual moral autonomy. Edmund Burke, the\nEnglishman who predicted the failure of the French Revolution, concluded the solution to the\ncorruption that led the National Assembly to failure “was to cultivate the character and judgment\nof Members and voters, rather than [merely] to open up the House of Commons to more popular\ninvolvement.”!3 Research in the previous chapter already made it clear that Rousseau’s\n\nantibiblical foundation led to illiberal consolidation of power.

John Oswalt of Asbury Theological Seminary asserted that the\nEnlightenment attempt to divorce logic and science from the metaphysical foundation of biblical\nthought—the attempt to make logic and science “stand on their own”—has left science\n“defenseless against the old gods.”!4 As a result, logic and science have begun to destroy\nthemselves, and humanity has begun a retreat to the pursuit of survival, dominance, comfort, and\npleasure.'> Where logic and science fall short, it follows that economic performance will\nlikewise founder. While a causal relationship is difficult to establish with certainty, there is an\napparent correlation between America’s and France’s respective views of the Bible and their\ndivergent economic performance.\n\nThe implications are that the more the Bible prevails in a society, the greater the\npropensity to establish and maintain civil and political liberties, freedom from institutional\n\nviolence, scientific progress, and economic prosperity,\n\n'4 John N.

The greatest\ntheological conflict lay between Protestant Christianity and Deism, and both sought to live\nwithin a “Christian society.” James Byrd also demonstrated that colonial ministers employed the\nBible extensively for support in the revolutionary effort, though certainly not without\ncontroversy. Finally, while American revolutionaries doubtless drew heavily from\nEnlightenment thought, they also drew heavily from Reformation thought, and even much of the\nformer was Reformation thought distilled into secular form.\n\nBecause of this relative theological consensus, the outcome of the American Revolution\nwas an “open marketplace of religion” where its practice was encouraged. Tocqueville noted\nAmericans’ “enlightened self-interest,” which led to cooperation and public participation. The\nAmerican notion of liberty meant they expected controversy and dispute, and they engineered a\npolitical system to accommodate it. Human rights were secured because of their sacred nature\nand man’s morally subordinate position under Divine authority, and as Tocqueville noted,\nequality coexisted with liberty. Even with America’s secularization, which came much later than\nin France, in America’s public schools, the rights of the state have deferred to those of religious\ngroups, and courts have protected parents’ rights to shape their children’s religious upbringing.\nThe United States has also seen unparalleled economic growth and strength throughout its\nhistory.\n\nIn pre-revolutionary France, however, the Roman Catholic Church not only suppressed\nReformation thought but also secured significant power and influence, tying itself inextricably to\n\nthe French monarchy. This led not only to a backlash against Catholic power but also against the\n\n99",

They, along with Rousseau, replaced the absolute God with a\nfaith in the absolute nature of Reason and what could be apprehended through its practice.\nCabanis replaced religion with “scientific” ideology.\n\nThe results were severe anticlericalism and a complete divorce between the public sphere\nand the private practice of religion, a militant form of /aicité. The Cult of Reason led people to\nexpect and pursue unanimity as legislators sought simply to “recognize laws as consonant with\nthe Supreme Reason which governs the universe.”!® As Reason came into conflict with Will, the\nCult of the Nation and the morally autonomous individual transformed liberty into conformity\nwith Reason. In an ironic twist, conforming to Nature became liberty, while any wayward\nexpression of free will became oppression. Instead of separation of power, the French result was\nconsolidation of power in the National Assembly, the Directorate, and finally Napoleon. Instead\nof political stability, France has seen frequent and violent political upheavals as the nation\nswerved between failed attempts at republicanism and periods of empire or restored monarchy.\n\nThe French pattern of centralization has played out economically with delayed capitalism\nand a recent tendency towards socialism, and France has been outpaced economically by 48 of\nthe 50 United States. Centralization has also played out in French schools, where individual\nrights are favored so much over those of religious groups or parents that in order to preserve\nindividual religious liberty, French schools cannot permit overt individual practice of it.\n\nWhile the American Revolution gave birth to modern republican democracy, scholars no\n\nlonger view the French Revolution as an obvious part of the birth of modern democracy.
