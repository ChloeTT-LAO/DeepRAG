    "Page_6": "TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS\n\n004 was a record year for Gray. Our television stations are continuing the tradition of being market\n\nleading local news organizations in the cities where we operate. The company has continued to\nmaintain an industry leading portfolio of high quality television stations. Gray has 23 of 31 stations\nranked #1 in their respective local market for delivering news audiences and 22 of 31 stations that are also\nranked #1 in overall viewing audience delivery based on ratings information provided by the A.C. Nielsen\nCompany. We believe no other major television station owner has, on a proportional basis, as many\nmarket leading television stations as Gray.\n\nWe were very pleased with the company’s operating results for the year ended December 31 2004. The\npolitical advertising net revenue of $41.7 million set a new record for the company. Gray was fortunate\nto have eight stations in five states that were closely contested during the 2004 Presidential campaign\nhelping to significantly increase the political revenues over the previous record set in 2002. Political\nrevenue aside, we were also especially pleased with the 7% rate of growth in our core television local time\nsales excluding political revenues. With local sales the company can leverage its strong news operations to\nattract large overall viewing audiences throughout the day and thereby gain a disproportionate share of the\nindividual market’s revenue. This growth in the core local business coupled with the very strong political\nrevenue helped to significantly increase 2004 total revenues and total media cash flow over the 2003\nresults. Total revenue increased 17% in 2004 to approximately $346.6 million compared to $295.4 million\nin 2003. Gray’s 2004 media cash flow increased 33% to approximately $152.2 million compared to 2003\nresults of $114.6 million.\n\nDuring 2004 the company continued to grow by expanding its group of television stations. In August\n2004, we were proud to commence broadcast operations in Charlottesville, Virginia and begin to serve\nthat community with a newly constructed station operating two channels: WCAV affiliated with CBS and\nWVAW affiliated with ABC. Before our stations began operations only one local station was serving the\ncommunity. We look forward to seeing both of these channels grow with the Charlottesville community\nover the coming years.\n\nWe announced our acquisition of KKCO, the NBC affiliate serving Grand Junction, Colorado during 2004\nand we completed this $13.5 million acquisition in January 2005. Grand Junction is a rapidly growing\narea of Colorado and we look forward to this #1 rated station continuing to grow with the local area.\n\nWe also grew in 2004 by launching a UPN affiliated channel in three different markets. The UPN\nprogramming is delivered to local cable operators using a portion of our digital television spectrum.\nThese new UPN channels located in Knoxville, TN, Lexington, KY and Augusta, GA, open new revenue\nopportunities for the company with very low operating and capital costs. We currently plan on launching\ntwo more UPN channels in other markets in 2005 and will continue to study the feasibility of launching\nadditional UPN channels in other markets that Gray already serves. We look forward to having these\nlocal UPN channels grow and develop over the next several years.",
    "Page_7": "Looking ahead to 2005, Gray is committed to maximizing its operating potential. In this “off-year” of the\ntwo year political advertising cycle the company will continue to focus on maximizing its core advertising\n\nrevenues while controlling operating cost increases.\n\nWe believe the company has a relatively moderate level of debt with primary maturity dates in 2010\n\nand 2011. The company’s leverage ratios decreased significantly due to the strong operating performance\nin 2004. Gray’s operating strengths and current capital structure should allow the company to generate\na significant amount of cash from its operations over the near term.\n\nOur challenge has been and will continue to be how to utilize this cash to ultimately enhance shareholder\nvalue in the near term as well as the long term. As part of enhancing shareholder value, the company\nincreased its dividend in the first quarter of 2004 by 50% to three cents per common share. Also, given\nthe very strong operating performance of the company during 2004, we were very pleased to provide a\nspecial dividend of twelve cents per common share that was paid in January 2005. Gray’s first quarter\n2005 ordinary dividend marks the 38th year the company has been paying ordinary dividends. We\nbelieve relatively few other broadcast companies have similar longevity in their dividend payment history.\nIn addition, during 2004 the company used a portion of the cash it generated from its operations to\nrepurchase approximately 1.7 million shares of Gray common stock thereby returning $22.4 million\n\nof value to shareholders.\n\nThe company’s primary mission has remained unchanged for over a decade. Gray maximizes its cash flow\nby striving to be the primary news and/or entertainment provider to the people living in the communities\nwe serve. We are proud of the community service projects we provide to the people living in the\ncommunities we serve. Gray is also fortunate to have dedicated and professional employees who work\nhard to fulfill the company’s primary mission.\n\nGray will continue to be a leader in delivering news and entertainment to the communities we serve.\nThat in turn will allow the company to continue to deliver strong results for its shareholders. Gray’s\nhistoric focus has been on the creation of long term value. We continue to believe executing this strategy\nis in the best interest of all shareholders.\n\nAs of March 14, 2005\n\nSeer Aa\n\nJ. Mack Robinson Robert S. Prather, Jr.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer President and Chief Operating Officer",

Television stations which\nbroadcast over the very high frequency (“VHF”) band (channels 2-13) of the spectrum generally have\nsome competitive advantage over television stations which broadcast over the ultra-high frequency\n(“UHF”) band (channels above 13) of the spectrum, because the former usually have better signal\ncoverage and operate at a lower transmission cost,\n\nTelevision station revenues are primarily derived from local, regional and national advertising and,\nto a much lesser extent, from network competisation and revenues from studio and tower space rental and\ncommercial production activities. Advertising rates are based upon a variety of factors, including a\nprogram's popularity among the viewers an advertiser wishes to attract, the number of advertisers\ncompeting for the available time, the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station\nand the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area, Rates are also determined by a\nstation's overall ratings and in-market share, as well as the station's ratings and share among particular\ndemographic groups, which an advertiser may be targeting. Because broadcast stations rely on\nadvertising revenues, they are sensitive to cyclical changes in the cconomy. The sizes of advertisers’\nbudgets, which are affected by broad economic trends, affect the broadcast industry in general and the\nrevenues of individual broadcast television stations.\n\nAll television stations in the country are grouped by Nielsen, a national audience measuring service,\ninto approximately 210 generally recognized television markets that are ranked in size according to\nvarious formulae based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area\nconsisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage\nof total viewing hours. Nielsen periodically publishes data on estimated audiences for the television\nStations in the various television markets throughout the country.",
    "Page_19": "Four major broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX dominate broadcast television.\nAdditionally, United Paramount Network (“UPN”), Warner Brothers Network (“WB”) and the Pax TV\nNetwork have been launched as additional television networks, An affiliate of FOX, UPN, WB or Pax\nTV receives a smaller portion of cach day’s programming from its network compared to an affiliate of\nABC, NBC or CBS.\n\nThe affiliation of a station with ABC, NBC or CBS has a significant impact on the composition of\nthe station’s programming, revenues, expenses and operations. A typical affiliate of these networks\nreceives the majority of each day's programming from the network. This programming, along with cash\npayments (“network compensation”) in certain instances, is provided to the affiliate by the network in\nexchange for a substantial majority of the advertising time available for sale during the airing of nctwork\nprograms. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenues. The affiliate retains the\nrevenues from time sold during breaks in and between network programs and programs the affiliate\nproduces or purchases from non-network sources. In acquiring programming to supplement\nprogramming supplied by the affiliated network, the affiliates compete primarily with other affiliates and\nindependent stations in their markets, Cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for\nprogramming, although various national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that\nwould have otherwise been offered to local television stations. In addition, a television station may\nacquire programming through barter arrangements. Under barter arrangements, a national program\ndistributor may receive advertising time in exchange for the programming it supplies, with the station\npaying a reduced or no fee for such programming. Most successful commercial television stations obtain\ntheir brand identity from locally produced news programs.\n\nIn contrast to a station affiliated with a network, a fully independent station purchases or produces\nall of the programming that it broadcasts, resulting in generally higher programming costs. An\nindependent station, however, retains its entire inventory of advertising time and all the revenues obtained\ntherefrom, As a result of the smaller amount of programming provided by its network, an affiliate of\nFOX, UPN, WB or Pax TV must purchase or produce a greater amount of programming, resulting in\ngenerally higher programming costs, These affiliate stations, however, retain a larger portion of the\ninventory of advertising time and the revenues obtained therefrom compared to stations affiliated with the\nmajor networks.\n\nCable-originated programming is a significant competitor for viewers of broadcast television\nprogramming, although no single cable programming network regularly attains audience levels amounting\nto more than a small fraction of any single major broadcast network. The advertising share of cable\nnetworks has increased as a result of the growth in cable penetration (the percentage of television\nhouseholds which are connected to a cable system), Notwithstanding such increases in cable viewership\nand advertising, over-the-air broadcasting remains the dominant distribution system for mass-market\ntelevision advertising.\n\nThe Company accounts for trade barter transactions involving the exchange of tangible goods or\nservices with its customers. The revenue is recorded at the time the advertisement is broadcast and the\nexpense is recorded at the time the goods or services are used, The revenue and expense associated with\nthese transactions are based on the fair value of the assets or services received,\n\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement No. 63, Financial\nReporting by Broadcasters, the Company does not account for barter revenue and related barter expense\ngenerated from network programming. The Company does not account for barter revenue and related\nbarter expense generated from syndicated programming. Management of the Company believes that\nbarter revenue and related expense generated from syndicated programming is immaterial. Furthermore,\nany such barter revenue recognized would then require the recognition of an equal amount of barter\nexpense. The recognition of these amounts would have no effect upon net income.",
    "Page_20": "Seasonality\n\nBroadcast advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters each year, due\nin part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to\nand including the holiday season. In addition, broadcast advertising revenues are generally higher during\neven numbered years due to spending by political candidates, which spending typically is heaviest during\nthe fourth quarter. The Company has received significant political advertising revenue during the current\nyear.\n\nNetwork Affiliation of the Stations\n\nEach of the Company’s stations is affiliated with a major network pursuant to an affiliation\nagreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all\nprograms transmitted by the network with which the station is affiliated. In return, the network has the\nright to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during such broadcasts. In exchange for every\nhour that a station clects to broadcast network programming, the network may, in certain instances, pay\nthe station a specific network compensation fee, which varies with the time of day. Typically, prime-time\nprogramming generates the highest hourly network compensation payments. Such payments are subject\nto increase or decrease by the network during the term of an affiliation agreement with provisions for\nadvance notices and right of termination by the station in the event of a reduction in such payments.\nAlthough network affiliation agreements have historically been renewed by the Company and the\nrespective networks, the Company can not guarantee that any agreements will be renewed in the future\nunder their current terms. Network compensation has declined in recent years at certain of the Company's\ntelevision stations reflecting an ongoing phase out of network compensation.

In 2000, the Company began\npublication of the Newton Citizen for distribution into neighboring Newton County. The Rockdale\nCitizen is located in Conyers, Georgia, the county seat of Rockdale County, which is 19 miles east of\ndowntown Atlanta. Rockdale County and Newton County’s combined population is estimated to be\napproximately 132,000,\n\nThe Goshen News\n\nThe Goshen News is published seven days a week with a circulation of 16,000 and serves Goshen,\nIndiana and surrounding areas. The Goshen News also produces a weekly advertising shopper. Since the\nCompany acquired The Goshen News in 1999, it has added a Sunday edition.\n\nIndustry Background\n\nNewspaper publishing is the oldest segment of the media industry and, as a result of the focus on\nlocal news, newspapers in general remain an important media for local advertising. Newspaper\nadvertising revenues are cyclical and have generally been affected by changes in national and regional\neconomic conditions. Financial instability in the retail industry, including bankruptcies of larger retailers\nand consolidations among large retail chains can result in reduced retail advertising expenditures.\nClassified advertising, which makes up approximately one-third of newspaper advertising expenditures,\ncan be affected by an economic slowdown and its effect on employment, real estate transactions and\nautomotive sales. However, growth in housing starts (the number of residential building projects\nbeginning in a specific period of time) and automotive sales, although cyclical in nature, generally\nprovide continued growth in newspaper advertising expenditures, While the newspaper publishing\nindustry is impacted by the economic cycles, it is not generally affected by the cyclical nature of political\nadvertising revenue.\n\nPagers and Wireless Services\nThe Paging Business\n\nThe paging business, acquired by the Company in September 1996, is based in Tallahassee, Florida\n\nand operates in Georgia, Alabama and Florida. In 2004, the Company's paging operations had\napproximately 41,000 units in service compared to approximately 53,000 units in service in 2003. The\npercentage of total Company revenues contributed by the paging segment was approximately 2%, 3% and\n4% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.\n\nAdditional Information on Business Segments\nReference is made to Note L. “Information on Business Segments” to the Company's audited\n\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional financial and other information\nregarding business segments.",
    "Page_22": "Competition\nTelevision Industry\n\nCompetition in the television industry exists on several levels: competition for audience,\ncompetition for programming (including news) and competition for advertisers. Additional factors that\nare material to a television station’s competitive position include signal coverage and assigned frequency.\n\nAudience. Stations compete for audience based on program popularity, which has a direct effect on\nadvertising rates. A substantial portion of the daily programming on each of the Company's stations is\nsupplied by the affiliated network. During those periods, the stations are dependent upon the performance\nof the network programs to attract viewers. There can be no assurance that such programming will\nachieve or maintain satisfactory viewership levels in the future. Non-network time penods are\nprogrammed by the station with a combination of locally produced news, public affairs and other\nentertainment programming, including news and syndicated programs purchased for cash, cash and\nbarter, or barter only.\n\nIn addition, the development of methods of television transmission of video programming other than\nover-the-air broadcasting, and in particular cable television, has significantly altered competition for\naudience in the television industry. These other transmission methods can increase competition for a\nbroadcasting station by bringing into its market distant broadcasting signals not otherwise available to the\nstation’s audience and also by serving as a distribution system for non-broadcast programming.\n\nOther sources of competition include home entertainment systems, “wireless cable” services,\nsatellite master antenna television systems, low power television stations, television translator stations,\ndirect broadcast satellite (“DBS”) video distribution services and the internet.\n\nProgramming, Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program\ndistributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Each station competes\nagainst the broadcast station competitors in its market for exclusive access to off-network reruns (such as\nSeinfeld) and first-run product (such as Oprah). Competition exists for exclusive news stories and\nfeatures as well. Cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for programming, although\nvarious national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise\nbeen offered to local television stations.\n\nAdvertising. Advertising rates are based upon the size of the market in which the station operates, a\nstation's overall ratings, a program's popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to attract, the\nnumber of advertisers competing for the available time, the demographic makeup of the market served by\nthe station, the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area, aggressive and\nknowledgeable sales forces and the development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser\nmessages to programming. Advertising revenues comprise the primary source of revenues for the\nCompany’s stations. The Company's stations compete for such advertising revenues with other television\nStations and other media in their respective markets. The stations also compete for advertising revenue\nwith other media, such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising,\nyellow page directories, direct mail, internet and local cable systems. Competition for advertising dollars\nin the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets.\n\nNewspaper Industry\nThe Company’s newspapers compete for advertisers with a number of other media outlets, including\n\nmagazines, radio, television and the internet, as well as other newspapers, which also compete for readers\nwith the Company’s publications. As a result, newspaper circulation has declined in recent years. One of\n\n10",

The Company differentiates its publications from the other newspaper by focusing\non local news and local sports coverage in order to compete with its larger competitor, The Company\nclearly identifies the markets it wishes to target and seeks to become the primary source for local news\nand advertising information within those markets.\n\nPaging Industry\n\nThe paging industry is highly competitive. Companies in the industry compete on the basis of price,\ncoverage area offered to subscribers, available services offered in addition to basic numeric or tone\npaging, transmission quality, system reliability and customer service. The Company's paging services\nalso compete with other wireless communications services such as cellular service, The Company\ncompetes by maintaining competitive pricing of its product and service offerings, by providing quality,\nreliable transmission networks and by furnishing subscribers a superior level of customer service.\nHowever, due to increased competition the number of units in service has decreased over the last several\nyears. The Company has also begun reselling cellular telephones and cellular services.\n\nFederal Regulation of the Company’s Business\nTelevision Broadcasting\n\nFCC Regulation, Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the\nCommunications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act”), as amended by, among other statutes, the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Telecommunications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits\nthe operation of television broadcasting stations except under a license issued by the FCC and empowers\nthe FCC, among other things, to issue, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses, determine the locations\nof stations, regulate the equipment used by stations, adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of the\nCommunications Act and impose penalties for violation of such regulations, The Communications Act\nprohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of a licensee without prior approval of the\nFCC,\n\nLicense Grant and Renewal. Television broadcasting licenses generally are granted or renewed for a\nperiod of eight years, but may be renewed for a shorter period upon a finding by the FCC that the “public\ninterest, convenience, and necessity” would be served thereby. Broadcast licenses are of paramount\nimportance to the Company's Television Broadcasting segment. The Communications Act requires a\nbroadcast license to be renewed if the FCC finds that; (i) the station has served the public interest,\nconvenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations of cither the Communications Act or\nthe FCC's rules and regulations by the licensee; and (iii) there have been no other violations which, taken\ntogether, would constitute a pattern of abuse, At the time an application is made for renewal of a\ntelevision license, parties in interest may file petitions to deny, and such parties, including members of the\npublic, may comment upon the service the station has provided during the preceding license term and\nurge denial of the application. If the FCC finds that the licensee has failed to meet the above-mentioned\nrequirements, it could deny the renewal application or grant a conditional approval, including renewal for\na lesser term. The FCC will not consider competing applications contemporaneously with a renewal\napplication. Only after denying a renewal application can the FCC accept and consider competing\napplications for the license, Although in substantially all cases broadcast licenses are renewed by the\nFCC even when petitions to deny are filed against broadcast license renewal applications, there can be no\nassurance that the Company’s stations’ licenses will be renewed. The Company is not aware of any facts\nor circumstances that could prevent the renewal of the licenses for its stations at the end of their\nrespective license terms. See the dates through which the current licenses are effective in the\nBroadcasting Summary table included on page 5 of this Annual Report.\n\n11",
    "Page_24": "Ownership Restrictions. Currently, the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules limit the ownership,\noperation or control of, as well as the “attributable” interests or voting power in: (1) television stations\nserving the same area; (2) television stations and daily newspapers serving the same arca; and (3)\ntelevision stations and radio stations serving the same area. The mules also limit the aggregate national\naudience reach of television stations that may be under common ownership, operation and control, or in\nwhich a single person or entity may hold office or have more than a specified interest or percentage of\nvoting power. Pursuant to the 1996 Act and recent appropriations legislation, the FCC must review all of\nits broadcast ownership rules every four years to determine if they remain necessary in the public interest.\n\nThe FCC completed a comprehensive review of its ownership rules in 2003, significantly relaxing\nrestrictions on the common ownership of television stations, radio stations and daily newspapers within\nthe same local market. However, the new mules have yet to take effect due to legal challenges. The\noutcome of litigation and legislative efforts and the ultimate landscape of FCC ownership regulation are\nin flux and may not be resolved for some time.\n\nSpecifically, on June 24, 2004, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit released a split decision rejecting much of the Commission's 2003 decision on media\nownership regulations. While affirming the FCC in certain respects, the Third Circuit found fault with the\nCommission's proposed new limits on media combinations, remanded them to the agency for further\nproceedings and extended a stay on the implementation of the new rules that it had imposed in September\n2003. As a result, the restrictions that were in place prior to the FCC's 2003 decision generally continue\nto govern media transactions, pending completion of the agency proceedings on remand and/or further\njudicial review.\n\nThe discussion below reviews the changes contemplated in the FCC’s 2003 decision and the Third\nCircuit's response to the revised ownership regulations that the Commission adopted.\n\nLocal TV Ownership Rule: In its 2003 decision, the FCC relaxed the local television ownership\nregulation by eliminating its \"eight voices\" test, which barred co-ownership of two TV stations in a local\nmarket unless at least cight independently owned, full-power television stations, or \"voices,\" remained.\nThe modified mule would have permitted a company to own two commercial television facilities (a\n\"duopoly\") in any market with at least five such stations, In the largest markets—those with at least 18\ntelevision stations—a company would, for the first time, be permitted to own three TV stations. So-called\n\"triopolies\" would be available only in a handful of the nation's largest markets. Under the new rules,\nboth duopolies and triopolies would be subject to the agency's \"top four\" limitation, meaning that no more\nthan one of the co-owned stations may be ranked among the top four in audience ratings. The new rule\nwould allow parties to seek waivers of the ‘top four” restriction in markets with |] or fewer stations.\n\nThe Third Circuit upheld the FCC's decision to retain a prohibition of common ownership of more\nthan one top-four ranked station in a given market. However, the Court remanded for further\nconsideration the other numerical limits applicable to same-market TV station combinations, and the\n\"eight voices\" requirement of the pre-2003 rules therefore remains in effect.\n\nCross-Media Limits: The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, originally adopted in 1975,\ngenerally prohibited one cntity from owning both a commercial broadcast station and a daily newspaper\nin the same community. The old radio/television cross-ownership rule allowed a party to own one TV\nstation (or two, if permitted under the television duopoly rule) and a varying number of radio stations\nwithin a single market, depending on the number of independently owned media voices that would remain\npost combination. The cross-media limits (\"CMLs\") adopted in the Commission's 2003 decision would\nsupplant both rules with three different categories of restrictions based on the number of commercial and\nnoncommercial television stations in the relevant locale. First, in markets with three or fewer TV\nstations, the FCC would not permit any cross-ownership among TV stations, radio stations, and daily\n\n12",
    "Page_25": "newspapers. Second, in markets with between four and eight TV stations, the agency would permit one\nof the following three combinations;\n\n« one or more daily newspaper(s), one TV station, and up to 50 percent of the radio stations that\nwould be permissible under the FCC's separate local radio ownership limits for that\ncommunity; or\n\n* one or more daily newspaper(s), and as many radio stations as can be owned pursuant to the\nlocal radio ownership limits; or\n\n+ two TV stations (so long as ownership would be permissible under the duopoly mule) and as\nmany radio stations as the local radio ownership limits permit, but no daily newspapers.\n\nThird, in local markets with nine or more TV stations, the Commission would allow any newspaper and\nbroadcast cross-media combinations, so long as they comply with the local TV ownership rule and local\nradio ownership rule.\n\nAlthough the Third Circuit determined that the Commission's decision to eliminate its outright ban\non newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership was justified, the court also found that the new CMLs adopted\nby the agency were inconsistent and based on irrational assumptions. The CMLs consequently were\nremanded to the Commission for further consideration, and the former radia/T'V cross-ownership limits as\nwell as the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership ban were left in place in the meantime.\n\nNational Television Station Ownership Rule; In its 2003 decision, the FCC raised the national TV\nownership cap—the percentage of national U.S. houscholds that a single owner can reach through\ncommonly owned television stations—from 35 percent to 45 percent. In that same decision, the\nCommission decided to retain the 50 percent \"discount\" that it currently grants to ultra-high frequency\n(\"UHEF\") stations, finding that the discount continues to be necessary to promote entry and competition\namong broadcast networks.\n\nThis rule change sparked considerable controversy in Congress, eventually leading lawmakers to\ninclude a new limitation in an appropriations bill. On January 22, 2004, President Bush signed into law\nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. Section 629 of that legislation set the national TV\nownership cap at 39 percent. In light of lawmakers' decision to set the limit statutorily, the Third Circuit\nruled that challenges before it to the national television ownership cap were moot. The court also\ndeclared that the legislative rider mooted questions about the UHF discount, which had been challenged\nby several parties.\n\nAttribution Rules. Under the FCC’s ownership rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of certain types\nof securities of the Company could violate FCC regulations if that purchaser owned or acquired an\n“attributable” interest in other media properties in the same areas as stations owned by the Company or in\na manner otherwise prohibited by the FCC, Pursuant to FCC rules adopted in August 1999, as modified\nslightly on January 2001, the following relationships and interests generally are considered attributable\nfor purposes of the agency's broadcast ownership restrictions:\n\n« All officers and directors of a licensee and its direct or indirect parent(s);\n+ Voting stock interests of at least five percent;\n\n+ Stock interests of at least 20 percent, if the holder is a passive institutional investor (investment\ncompanies, banks, insurance companies);\n\n13",
    "Page_26": "+ Any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company, unless properly\n“insulated” from management activities; and\n\n+ Equity and/or debt interests which in the aggregate exceed 33 percent of a licensee's total\nassets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15 percent of the station’s total weekly\nprogramming, or is a same-market broadcast company or newspaper.\n\n+ Time brokerage of a broadcast station by a same-market broadcast company or newspaper.\n\n+ Same market radio joint sales agreements (in addition, the Commission is considering making\nsame-market television joint sales agreements attributable.)\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no officer, director or 5% stockholder of the Company\ncurrently holds an attributable interest in another television station, radio station or daily newspaper that is\ninconsistent with the FCC’s ownership rules and policies or with ownership by the Company of its\nstations.\n\nAlien Ownership Restrictions. The Comnvunications Act restricts the ability of foreign entities or\nindividuals to own or hold interests in broadcast licenses. Foreign governments, representatives of\nforeign governments, non-citizens, representatives of non-citizens, and corporations or partnerships\norganized under the laws of a forcign nation are barred from holding broadcast licenses. Non-citizens,\ncollectively, may directly or indirectly own or vote up to 20% of the capital stock of a licensee. In\naddition, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that is controlled, directly\nor indirectly, by any other corporation more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by\nnon-citizens or their representatives or by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S.\ncorporations if the FCC finds that the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such\nlicense. The Company has been advised that the FCC staff has interpreted this provision of the\nCommunications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be\ngranted to or held by any such corporation, and the FOC has made such an affirmative finding only in\nlimited circumstances. The Company, which serves as a holding company for wholly-owned subsidiaries\nthat are licensees for its stations, therefore may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of its stock\nowned or voted directly or indirectly by non-citizens, foreign governments, representatives of non-\ncitizens or foreign governments, or foreign corporations.\n\nProgramming and Operations, The FCC significantly reduced its regulation of the programming and\nother operations of broadcast stations a number of years ago, including elimination of formal\nascertainment requirements and guidelines concerning the amounts of some types of programming and\ncommercial matter that may be broadcast, There are, however, FCC rules and policies, and rules and\npolicies of other federal agencies, that regulate matters such as network/affiliate relations, political\nadvertising practices, obscene and indecent programming, accessibility of television programming to\naudience members who are visually or hearing disabled, children’s programming, employment practices,\nand other areas affecting the business or operations of broadcast stations.\n\nThe Children’s Television Act of 1990 limits the permissible amount of commercial matter in\nchildren's television programs and requires each television station to present cducational and\ninformational children’s programming, The FCC subsequently adopted stricter children's programming\nrequirements, including a requirement that television broadcasters provide a minimum of three hours of\nchildren’s educational programming per week. In addition, in September 2004, the FCC issued the first\nin what may be a series of “public interest” mandates relating to the implementation of digital television\nservice (\"DTV\") (which is discussed in detail below). Among other things, the Commission determined\nthat the amount of children’s educational programming it would require a DTV broadcaster to air will\nincrease proportionally with the number of free video programming streams broadcast simultaneously (or\n\n14",
    "Page_27": "\"multicast\") by the broadcaster, In addition, the FCC extended its existing limits on the duration and\ncontent of commercials aired during children’s programming to digital programming. The agency also\nestablished new restraints designed to address excessive “commercialization” of children’s fare on both\nanalog and digital programming, including a ban on the airing of Internet addresses to web pages\ncontaining commercial content.\n\nIn August 2003, FCC Chairman Michael Powell announced the opening of a proceeding to seck\ncomment on a wide range of measures aimed at promoting “localism” in broadcasting. This initiative has\nresulted in the creation of a Localism Task Force to conduct studies to measure localism, organize @ series\nof public hearings on localism around the country and offer recommendations to both the agency and\nCongress on how to promote localism in television and radio. In July 2004, the Commission released a\nwide-ranging Notice of Inquiry into broadcasters” localism practices, The NOI asks whether additional\nregulation is necessary to ensure that licensees satisfy the programming needs and interests of their local\naudiences. Among other things, the Commission suggests imposing minimum requirements for the\namount of time dedicated to local and national political programming. This proceeding remains pending,\nand the Company cannot predict its outcome,\n\nThe FCC recently has also stepped up its enforcement with respect to broadcast indecency issues, In\ndoing so, the Commission has explicitly stated its willingness to find licensees liable for repeated\nviolations during a single program (which can lead to significantly increased fines) and issued wamings\nabout possible license revocation proceedings for scrious violations. The agency brought several\nsignificant indecency enforcement actions in 2004 and proposed a new rule requiring broadcasters to\nretain copies of their programming for a limited time, purportedly to facilitate investigation into and\nprosecution of indecency violations, That proposal remains pending,\n\nEEO Rules, In October 2002, the FCC adopted new Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) Rules\nthat went into effect March 10, 2003. The new rules impose job information dissemination, recruitment\nand reporting requirements. Specifically, broadcasters must (1) widely disseminate information\nconceming cach full-time job vacancy; (2) provide notice of each full-time job vacancy to recruitment\norganizations requesting notice, and (3) complete additional “recruitment initiatives,” such as\nparticipation in job fairs, scholarship programs and EEO training. The new mules also require licensees to\nfile periodic reports relating to the EEO requirements. Broadcasters may be subject to random audits to\nensure compliance with the new EEO rules and could be sanctioned for noncompliance,\n\nCable and Satellite Transmission of Local Television Signals. The FCC has adopted various\nregulations to implement provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of\n1992, as amended by the 1996 Act, governing the relationship between broadcasters and cable operators.\nAmong other matters, these regulations require cable systems to devote a specified portion of their\nchannel capacity to the carriage of the signals of local television stations and permit TV stations to elect\nbetween \"must carry rights\" or a right to restrict or prevent cable systems from carrying the station's\nsignal without the station's permission (\"retransmission consent\"). The Communications Act and FCC\nregulations also contain measures to facilitate competition among cable systems, telephone companies\nand other systems in the distribution of TV signals, video programming and other services. Each of the\nCompany’s stations has elected “nyust carry” status on certain cable systems in its DMA. On other cable\nsystems, the Company’s stations have entered into retransmission consent agreements, These elections\nand agreements will entitle the Company's stations to carriage on those systems until at least December\n31, 2005.\n\nIn November 1999, Congress enacted the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999\n(\"SHVIA\"), which established a copyright licensing system for limited distribution of television\nprogramming to DBS viewers and directed the FCC to initiate rulemaking proceedings to implement the\nnew system. SHVIA also extended the current system of satellite distribution of distant network signals\nto unserved households (/.c., those that do not receive a Grade B signal from a local network affiliate),\n\n15",
    "Page_28": "As part of the rulemakings required under SHVIA, the FCC established a market-specific\nrequirement for mandatory carriage of local television stations. Similar to the obligations applicable to\ncable systems, the rules require satellite operators to carry all local broadcast signals in those markets in\nwhich they choose to provide any local signal, beginning January 1, 2002. Stations in affected markets\nwere required to select cither must carry or retransmission consent nights by July 1, 2001. This election is\neffective from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005. Further, under SHVIA, those broadcasters\nselecting retransmission consent (as opposed to must carry rights) originally were required to meet certain\n\"good faith\" requirements in negotiating for carriage rights until 2006.\n\nWith SHVIA set to expire on December 31, 2004, Congress recently passed the Satellite Home\nViewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004 (“SHVERA”), which extends the compulsory\ncopyright license for carriage of distant signals through December 31, 2009 and addresses a variety of\nother issues related to the carriage of broadcast television signals on DBS systems. Specifically,\nSHVERA requires satellite carriers to phase out the carriage of distant signals in markets where they carry\nlocal broadcast signals, The new statute also permits satellite carricrs to deliver the distant signal of a\nnetwork station to consumers in unserved digital households (also referred to as “digital white areas”), but\nonly if the local station affiliated with that network misses the FCC's deadlines for increasing its digital\nsignal power (also discussed below). In addition, the law extends to DBS operators the obligation to\nnegotiate in good faith with respect to retransmission consent arrangements. Previously, only\nbroadcasters were subject to the good faith requirement, which was scheduled to sunset on December 31,\n2005 but will now sunset on December 31, 2009, The Company cannot predict the impact of DBS\nservice upon the Company’s business. It has, however, entered a retransmission consent agreement with\nEchoStar and DirectT'V for the retransmission of its television stations’ signals into the local markets that\nthey serve.\n\nDigital Television Service. In April 1997, the FCC adopted rules for implementing DTV service in\nthe United States, which will improve the technical quality of television signals received by viewers and\ngive television broadcasters the ability to provide new services, including high-definition television.\n\nOn April 3, 1997, all broadcasters holding a license or construction permit for a full-power television\nstation were assigned a second channel in order to provide cither scparate DTV programming or a\nsimulcast of their analog programming. These second channels were assigned for an eight-year transition\nperiod scheduled to end in 2006, Stations were required to construct their DTV facilities and be on the air\nwith a digital signal according to a schedule set by the FCC based on the type of station and the size of the\nmarket in which it is located. Generally, under current FCC rules each of the Company's stations was\nrequired to construct DTV facilities and commence operations by May 2002. Except as noted below, all\nother commercial broadcasters were required to follow suit by May 1, 2002. As of the date of filing this\nAnnual Report, the Company was in compliance with the FCC's digital broadcasting requirements at all\nof its stations.\n\nAt the end of the DTV transition period, analog television transmissions will cease and DTV\nchannels will be reassigned to a smaller segment of the broadcasting spectrum comprising channels 2-51.\nAlthough the FCC has targeted December 31, 2006 as the date by which all television broadcasters must\nreturn their analog licenses, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allows broadcasters to maintain beth their\nanalog and digital licenses in a market until at least 85 percent of the television households in that market\ncan receive a digital signal. In 2004, the agency’s Media Bureau proposed a plan (dubbed the \"Ferree\nPlan” after FCC Media Bureau Chief Ken Ferree) that would allow the 85 percent threshold to be met\nnationwide on January 1, 2009. In addition, there have been legislative proposals designed to speed up\nthe end of the transition. The Company cannot predict the outcome of cither the Commission’s or the\nlegislative proposals.\n\nWhen the FCC adopted service rules for the digital television transition, it stated that it would\nperiodically review the transition’s progress. In its first review, completed in 2001, the Commission\n\n16",
    "Page_29": "decided to permit broadcasters to construct initial minimal DTV facilities (i.e., facilities that cover only\ntheir cities of license) while retaining interference protection for their allotted and maximized facilities,\n\nIn September 2004, the FCC issued a decision in its second periodic review of the DTV transition,\nin which it revisited several of the issues addressed in 2001 and considered a number of new matters.\n\n* Set deadlines by which broadcasters operating with minimal (e.g., reduced power) DTV facilities\nmust cither provide DTV service to their full authorized coverage areas or else lose interference\nprotection to the unserved areas. For top 4 network affiliated stations in the top 100 markets, the\ndeadline is July 1, 2005; for all remaining commercial and non-commercial stations, the deadline\nis July 1, 2006.\n\n+ Established a multi-step process by which broadcasters may select their post-transition DTV\nchannel within the core DTV spectrum (Channels 2-51); this process began in November 2004,\nwith a goal of having all channel assignments finalized by the end of 2006.\n\nThe FCC will continue to review the progress of DTV periodically and make adjustments to the\ntransition schedule, as necessary.\n\nThe FCC also is considering whether and how to extend cable systems’ obligations for mandatory\ncarriage of broadcast stations’ DTV channels. In January 2001, the FCC issued a preliminary decision\nregarding the carriage (\"must carry\") rights of digital television broadcasters on local cable and certain\nDBS systems. Although the FCC deferred making a decision as to whether broadcasters are entitled to\nsimultaneous carriage of both their digital and analog signals during the transition to DTV, the FCC did\ndetermine the following;\n\n+  Digital-only television stations may immediately assert carriage rights on local cable systems;\n\n+ Television stations that return their analog spectrum and convert to digital operations are entitled\nto must carry rights; and\n\n+ A digital-only station asserting must carry rights is entitled only to carriage of a single\nprogramming stream and other \"program-related\" content, regardless of the number of programs\nit multicasts on its digital spectrum.’\n\nSeveral parties filed petitions for reconsideration of various parts of the FCC’s DTV must carry\ndecision. Those petitions remain pending before the Commission and the Company cannot predict what\nchanges, if any, the FCC will make to its DTV must carry mules on reconsideration.\n\nIn addition, because it determined that the lack of DTV receiver capability in television sets was\ndelaying the transition, the FCC issued a decision in August 2003 adopting a plan to phase in the\ninclusion of digital tuning and decoding devices in television sets, Specifically, the decision requires all\nnew television sets with screens 13 inches and larger and all TV interface devices (VCRs, etc.) to include\nthe capability of tuning and decoding over-the-air digital signals by 2007.\n\nAnother major concern for the DTV transition volves the technical standards needed to ensure that\ndigital television sets can connect to cable systems. On September 10, 2003, the FCC adopted “plug-and-\n\n\"In its September 2004 decision, the Commission also climinated a requirement that broadcasters simulcast a certain\npercentage of the video programming of their analog channel on their DTV channel. The FCC noted, however, that\nit will continue to monitor the transition’s progress and, if necessary, re-impose the requirement at a later date.\n\n17",
    "Page_30": "play” rules for cable adaptability, Under these rules, consumers will be able to plug their cable directly\ninto their digital televisions, without the need for a set-top box. These rules cover one-way programming\nonly; the cable and electronics industries are working toward an agreement on two-way “plug-and-play”\nstandards that would eliminate the need for set-top boxes for advanced services such as video on demand,\nimpulse pay-per-view and cable operator-enhanced electronic programming guides. The Company\ncannot predict the outcome of those negotiations.\n\nThe FCC also has issued a decision regarding the protection of over-the-air digital broadcasts from\nunauthorized copying and distribution. Specifically, on November 4, 2003, the Commission adopted anti-\npiracy protection for digital television in the form of a “broadcast flag.” A broadcast flag is a digital code\nthat can be embedded into a digital broadcasting stream. This will allow a broadcaster, at its discretion, to\nprevent mass distribution of its digital signal over the Internet, without affecting consumers’ ability to\nmake digital copies. Digital television equipment must comply with the FCC’s broadcast flag\nrequirements by July 1, 2005.\n\nAdditionally, the FCC recently adopted rules and procedures to facilitate the digital conversion of\nLow Power Television (“LPTV”) stations, TV translator stations and TV booster stations. Under these\nrules, existing, LPTV and TV translator stations may convert to digital operations on their current\nchannels, Alternatively, LPTV and translator licenses may seek a digital “companion” channel for their\nanalog station operations, At a later date, the FCC will determine the date by which those stations\nobtaining a digital companion channel must surrender one of their channels.\n\nBroadcasters are permitted either to use their digital spectrum to provide a single HDTV signal or to\nmulticast several program streams in lower resolution formats, known as standard definition television\n(“SDTV”). Broadcasters also may use some of their digital spectrum to provide non-broadcast\n“ancillary” services—such as subscription video, data transfer or audio signals—provided such services\ndo not interfere with the mandatory free digital broadcasts. Stations using their DTV spectrum for\nsubscription services must pay the government a fee of 5 percent of gross revenues received from such\nuse of the digital spectrum. Because of the flexibility of the U.S. digital system, moreover, licensees are\nable to shift between different quality services (including data) in different time periods.\n\nMoreover, broadcasters currently are not required to provide a minimum amount of HDTV\nprogramming. Thus, licensees may use their digital channels according to their best business judgment,\nprovided they continue to offer at least one free programming service with a resolution comparable to or\nbetter than today’s service. Network-affiliated DTV broadcasters in the top 30 television markets must\nbroadcast a DTV signal at any time they broadcast an analog signal. All other stations currently must air\na DTV signal for an amount of time equivalent to 75 percent of the time they provide an analog signal,\nincreasing to 100 percent on April 1, 2005. The DTV signal must always be in operation during prime\ntime hours.\n\nIn addition, as discussed above, in September 2004, the FCC issued an order specifically addressing\nthe children’s programming obligations of DIV broadcast licensees. Still under consideration in a\nproceeding initially launched during the Clinton Administration are such issues as whether a licensee's\npublic interest obligations attach to the DTV channel as a whole or to each program stream offered by the\nlicensee; whether broadcasters should be required to report their public interest programming and\nactivities on a quarterly basis; whether the Commission should establish more specific minimum public\ninterest requirements for broadcasters; and how broadcasters could improve candidate access to\ntelevision. Also under consideration is the extent to which DTV broadcasters should be required to\nparticipate in the Emergency Alert System. The Company cannot predict the outcomes of these\nproceedings.\n\n18",

Legal Proceedings.\n\nSettlement of Income Tax Matter\n\nIn October 2001, the Company received a notice of deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service\n(the “IRS”) with respect to its 1996 and 1998 federal income tax returns, The notice of deficiency alleged\nthat the Company recognized a significant amount of taxable gain from the sale of certain assets in 1996\nin connection with a business acquisition from First American Media, Inc. The notice of deficiency also\nalleged that the Company’s 1996 acquisition of certain assets from First American Media, Inc. should be\ncharacterized for tax purposes as an acquisition of stock. On January 18, 2002, the Company filed a\npetition to contest the matter in the United States Tax Court.\n\nIn January 2004, the Company settled its litigation with the IRS regarding all deficiencies related to the\nIRS’ audit of the Company’s 1996 and 1998 federal income tax returns, The settlement required no cash\npayments from the Company. The Company agreed in the settlement to forego certain claimed\ndepreciation and amortization deductions relating to the 1996 through 1999 tax years, which in turn\nresulted in a reduction of the federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards by approximately $16.3\nmillion. During the three months ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash charge to\ndecrease its deferred tax assets by approximately $5.8 million to reflect this settlement. During 2004 and\nas a result of the settlement, the Company collected a previously claimed federal tax cash refund of\napproximately $1.1 million, plus statutory interest, that related to 1996.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is not a party to any legal proceedings in which an adverse outcome would have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect, cither individually or in the aggregate, upon the Company except as described\nbelow,\n\n24",
    "Page_37": "Investment in Broadcasting Company\n\nThe Company has an equity investment in Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. (“Tarzian”) representing shares in\nTarzian which were originally held by the estate of Mary Tarzian (the “Estate”). As described more fully\nbelow, the Company's ownership of the Tarzian shares is subject to certain litigation.\n\nOn February 12, 1999, Tarzian filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nIndiana against U.S. Trust Company of Florida Savings Bank as Personal Representative of the Estate,\nclaiming that Tarzian had a binding and enforceable contract to purchase the Tarzian shares from the Estate.\nOn February 3, 2003, the Court entered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of Tarzian for breach of contract\nand awarding Tarzian $4.0 million in damages. The Court denied the Estate’s renewed motion for judgment\nas a matter of law, and alternatively, for a new trial on the issue of liability; denied Tarzian’s motion to\namend the judgment to award Tarzian specific performance of the contract and title to the Tarzian shares;\nand granted Tarzian’s motion to amend the judgment to include pre-judgment interest on the $4,0 million\ndamage award. The Estate appealed the judgment and the Court’s rulings on the post-trial motions, and\nTarzian cross-appealed. On February 14, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a\ndecision concluding that no contract was ever created between Tarzian and the Estate, reversing the\njudgment of the District Court, and remanding the case to the District Court with instructions to enter\njudgment for the Estate. On February 25, 2005, Tarzian filed a petition for a rehearing. The Company\ncannot predict when the final resolution of this litigation will occur.\n\nOn March 7, 2003, Tarzian filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia against Bull Run Corporation and the Company for tortious interference with contract and\nconversion. The lawsuit alleges that Bull Run Corporation and Gray purchased the Tarzian shares with\nactual knowledge that Tarzian had a binding agreement to purchase the stock from the Estate. The\nlawsuit seeks damages in an amount equal to the liquidation value of the interest in Tarzian that the stock\nrepresents, which Tarzian claims to be as much as $75 million, as well as attorneys’ fees, expenses, and\npunitive damages. The lawsuit also seeks an order requiring the Company and Bull Run Corporation to\ntum over the stock certificates to Tarzian and relinquish all claims to the stock. The stock purchase\nagreement with the Estate would permit the Company to make a claim against the Estate in the event that\ntitle to the Tarzian Shares is ultimately awarded to Tarzian. There is no assurance that the Estate would have\nsufficient assets to honor any or all of such potential claims. The Company filed its answer to the lawsuit on\nMay 14, 2003 denying any liability for Tarzian’s claims. On February 23, 2005, the Court granted the\nparties’ consent motion staying discovery pending a ruling from the Seventh Circuit on any petition for\nrehearing filed by Tarzian in the Indiana litigation referenced above. The Company believes it has\nmeritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. The Company cannot predict when the\nfinal resolution of this litigation will occur.\n\nItem 4.

    "Page_42": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Overview\nIntroduction\n\nThe following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Gray Television, Inc.\n(the “Company”) should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial\nstatements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Company derives its revenues primarily from its television broadcasting operations and to a\nlesser extent, from its newspaper publishing and paging operations, The operating revenues of the\nCompany’s television stations are derived from broadcast advertising revenues and, to a much lesser\nextent, from ancillary services such as production of commercials and tower rentals as well 2s\ncompensation paid by the networks to the stations for broadcasting network programming. The operating\nrevenues of the Company's newspaper publishing operations are derived from advertising, circulation and\nclassified revenue, Paging revenue is derived primarily from the sale of pagers, cellular telephones and\nrelated services. Certain information concerning the relative contributions of the Company's television\nbroadcasting, publishing and paging operations is provided in Note L. “Information on Business\nSegments” to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\n\nIn the Company's broadcasting operations, broadcast advertising is sold for placement either\npreceding or following a television station’s network programming and within local and syndicated\nprogramming. Broadcast advertising is sold in time increments and is priced primarily on the basis of a\nprogram’s popularity among the specific audience an advertiser desires to reach, as measured by Nielsen.\nIn addition, broadcast advertising rates are affected by the number of advertisers competing for the\navailable time, the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station and the availability\nof altemative advertising media in the market area. Broadcast advertising rates are the highest during the\nmost desirable viewing hours, with corresponding reductions during other hours. The matings of a local\nstation affiliated with a major network can be affected by ratings of network programming.\n\nMost broadcast advertising contracts are short-term, and generally run only for a few weeks.\nApproximately 69% of the net revenues of the Company's television stations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2004, were generated from local advertising (including political advertising revenues),\nwhich is sold primarily by a station’s sales staff directly to local accounts, and the remainder represented\nprimarily by national advertising, which is sold by a station’s national advertising sales representative.\nThe stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local, regional and national advertising\nand the stations also pay commissions to the national sales representative on national advertising.\n\nBroadcast advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters each year, duc\nin part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to\nand including the holiday season. In addition, broadcast advertising revenues are generally higher during\neven numbered years duc to spending by political candidates, which spending typically is heaviest during\nthe fourth quarter. The Company has received significant political advertising revenue during the current\nyear.\n\nThe Company’s publishing operations’ advertising contracts are gencrally entered into annually and\nprovide for a commitment as to the volume of advertising to be purchased by an advertiser during the\nyear, The publishing operations’ advertising revenues are primarily generated from local advertising and\nare gencrally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year.\n\n30",
    "Page_43": "The Company’s paging subscribers either own pagers, thereby paying solely for the use of the\nCompany's paging services, or lease pagers, thereby paying a periodic charge for both the pagers and the\npaging services. The terms of the lease contracts are month-to-month, three months, six months or twelve\nmonths in duration. Paging revenues are generally equally distributed throughout the year.\n\nThe broadcasting operations’ primary operating expenses are employee compensation, related\nbenefits and programming costs. The publishing operations’ primary operating expenses are employee\ncompensation, related benefits and newsprint costs. The paging operations’ primary operating expenses\nare employee compensation and other communications costs, In addition, the broadcasting, publishing\nand paging operations incur overhead expenses, such as maintenance, supplies, insurance, rent and\nutilities, A large portion of the operating expenses of the broadcasting. publishing and paging operations\nis fixed, although the Company has experienced significant variability in its newsprint costs in recent\nyears.\n\nRecent Acquisition Activity\n\nOn January 31, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of KKCO-T'V for approximately\n$13.5 million plus related transaction costs. KKCO-TV, Channel 1! serves the Grand Junction, Colorado\ntelevision market and is an NBC affiliate, The Company used a portion of its cash on hand to fully fund\nthis acquisition. Due to the acquisition of KKCO-TV occurring in 2005, the operating results of KKCO-\nTV are not reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 included elsewhere herein.\n\nOn August 17, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of a Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) television license for WCAV-TV, Channel 19, in Charlottesville, Virginia from\nCharlottesville Broadcasting Corporation. Gray's cost to acquire that FCC license was approximately $1\nmillion, See Note B. “Purchase of Federal Communications License” to the Company's audited\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. There were no acquisitions or dispositions\nduring 2003.\n\nThe Company acquired Gray MidAmerica Television (formerly Stations Holding Company) and\nKOLO-TV (the “2002 Acquisitions”) during the fourth quarter of 2002. The acquisitions were accounted\nfor under the purchase method of accounting. The operating results of the television stations acquired in\nthe 2002 Acquisitions were included in the 2002 operating results from the date of their acquisitions\nforward. See Note C, “Business Acquisitions” to the Company's audited consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere herein.\n\nBroadcasting, Publishing and Other Revenues\nSet forth below are the principal types of revenues camed by the Company's broadcasting,\n\npublishing and other operations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each to the\nCompany’s total revenues (dollars in thousands);\n\n31",

Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 17% to $346.6 million.\n\n¢ Broadcasting revenues increased 21% over the same period of the prior year to $293.3 million.\nThe increase in broadcasting revenues reflects increased political advertising revenues as well as\nincreased non-political broadcasting advertising revenues, Political advertising revenues\nincreased to $41.7 million from $5.7 million. Political advertising revenues for 2004 primarily\nreflect the cyclical influence of the 2004 Presidential election. Excluding political advertising\nrevenues, local broadcasting advertising revenues increased 7% to $160.7 million from $150.1\nmillion and national broadcasting advertising revenues remained at $70.8 million. We attribute\nthe increases in non-political local broadcasting advertising revenues to improved economic\nconditions and broad based demand for commercial time by local advertisers in the markets in\nwhich we operate. We believe that commercial time used for political advertising limited, in part,\nthe amount of commercial time available for sale by the Company to national advertisers during\nthe year ended December 31, 2004. Although the Company's network compensation increased in\nthe current year, these revenues will decrease in future periods due to the Company's new\nnetwork affiliation contracts which will generate lower revenues in future periods.\n\n© Publishing and other operations include the operating results of the newspaper publishing and\npaging operations. These revenues increased 2% to $53.3 million. Retail advertising revenue\nand classified advertising revenue were the primary contributors to the increase in these revenues.\nRetail advertising increased 7% and classified advertising revenue increased 6%, The increase in\nretail advertising revenue was due largely to systematic account development, market growth and\nrate increases. The increase in classified advertising revenue was due to increases in help wanted\n\n32",
    "Page_45": "advertisements. Circulation revenue decreased 8%, Circulation revenue decreased largely due to\na rate decrease at one of the Company’s newspapers. The rates were decreased in order to\npromote long-term sales and to increase subscription retention. Paging revenue decreased 10% to\n$7.2 million. The decrease was due primarily to price competition and a reduction of units in\nservice. The Company had approximately 41,000 and 53,000 pagers in service at December 31,\n2004 and 2003, respectively. The number of units in service decreased as a result of increased\ncompetition from other communication services and products such as cellular telephones. The\nnumber of pagers in service has declined over the past several years. The decrease in revenue\nfrom the sale and leasing of pagers has been partially offset by reselling of cellular telephone\nservices. The trend of decreasing paging revenue is expected to continue in the future.\n\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 6% to $233.4\n\nmillion,\n\nBroadcast operating expenses for all stations, before depreciation and amortization, increased 9% to\n$158.3 million, Payroll expense, excluding incentive based compensation, increased $4.8 million\ndue to an increase in the number of employees, annual salary increases for existing employees\nand employee benefit costs. The increase in the number of employees is primarily attributable to\nthe commencement of broadcast operations at WCAV-TV, the Company's new station located in\nCharlottesville, Virginia which began operations in August of 2004. Employee incentive based\ncompensation increased $1.4 million as a result of increased revenues produced by the\nCompany’s broadcast stations, Professional services increased $2.8 million including a $1,7\nmillion increase in sales commissions paid to national sales representative firms which is\nattributable to the increase in political advertising in 2004.\n\nPublishing and other operating expenses, before depreciation and amortization, increased 3% to\n$38.7 million, Newsprint expenses increased [8% to $5.2 million while payroll expenses\nincreased 3% to $18.7 million. The increase in newsprint expense was due to an increase in the\ncost per ton of newsprint. The increase in payroll expense is due to an increase in salaries for\nexisting employees,\n\nCorporate and administrative expenses, before depreciation and amortization, increased 38% to\n$11.7 million dwe primarily to increased employee payroll expense and other professional service\nexpenses. Payroll expense, excluding incentive based compensation, increased approximately\n$249,000 due to the addition of an internal auditor, payroll increases and increased employee\nbenefits for existing personnel. Employee incentive based compensation increased by\napproximately $1 million as a result of the improved operating results of the Company. The\nincrease in professional fees is due primarily to increased accounting costs of approximately $1.0\nmillion incurred in our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n\nDepreciation of property and equipment totaled $23.7 million and $21.7 million for the years\nended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in depreciation was due to newly\nacquired equipment,\n\nAmortization of intangible assets was $975,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as\ncompared to $5.6 million for the same period of the prior year, a decrease of $4.6 million, or\n83%, The decrease in amortization expense was due to certain definite lived intangible assets that\nwere acquired in 2002, becoming fully amortized.\n\nAmortization of restricted stock awards increased 13% to $512,000.

The majority of this interest income\nwas received from interest on the Company's cash and cash equivalents balances.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $1.4 million to $42.0 million. This decrease is\nprimarily attributable to lower average interest rates in 2004 compared to 2003. The total average debt\nbalance was $656.9 million and $657.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,\nrespectively. The total average interest rates were 6.08% and 6.16% for the years ended December 31,\n2004 and 2003, respectively.\n\nIncome tax expense, The effective tax rate decreased to 38.7% from 55.3%, Income tax expense for\n2003 included an additional $5.8 million in expense resulting from settlement of litigation with the IRS\nrelating to the acquisition of certain television assets in 1996. See Note H. “Income Taxes” to the\nCompany's audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussions of this\nmatter.\n\nPreferred dividends, Preferred dividends were $3.3 million for each of the years ended December\n31, 2004 and December 31, 2003.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2003 to Year Ended December 31, 2002\n\nRevenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 49% to § 295.4 million as\ncompared to the prior year due primarily to the television stations acquired in the 2002 Acquisitions,\n\nBroadcasting revenues increased $96,3 million, or 66%, to $ 243.1 million, The acquired stations\nhad revenue of $127.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the $25.4\nmillion for the period subsequent to the acquisitions in 2002, an increase of $102.5 million. With\nrespect to our television stations that were owned continuously for 2003 and 2002, revenue for the\nyear ended December 31, 2003, decreased $6.2 million, or 5%. This decrease was primarily the net\nresult of increases in local advertising revenue of 5% and national advertising revenue of 4% offset\nby decreases in political advertising revenue of 82% and network revenue of 13%. Local\nadvertising revenues increased due to local account development. National advertising revenue\nincreased due, in part, to slowly improving general economic conditions and commercial\ninventory being available for use by national customers rather than being used for political\nadvertising. The decrease in cyclical political advertising revenue is due to 2003 being an “off\nyear” in the political cycle which results in fewer political races, Network compensation declined\nreflecting the ongoing phase out of network compensation at certain of our television stations.\n\ne Publishing and other operations include the operating results of the newspaper publishing and\npaging operations, These revenues increased 1% to $52.3 million. Retail advertising increased\n5%, Classified advertising and circulation revenues decreased less than 1% respectively. The\nincrease in retail advertising revenue is attributable to systematic account development and rate\nincreases. Paging revenue decreased 4% to $7.9 million.

Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 54% to\n$220.7 million. The increase resulted primarily from increases in broadcasting expenses, amortization,\ndepreciation, and corporate overhead.\n\n* Broadcast operating expenses for all stations, before depreciation and amortization, increased 78%\nto $145,7 million. The 2002 Acquisitions were the primary reason for the increase in broadcast\nexpenses. The acquired stations had broadcast expenses of $76.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2003 compared to $13.2 million for the period subsequent to the acquisitions in\n2002, With respect to our television stations that were owned continuously for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2003 and 2002, broadcast expenses increased 1%. For the continuously owned\nstations, payroll expense increased 3%, or $1.3 million. For these continuously owned stations,\nsyndicated programming costs increased 1%, or $59,000, and other broadcast expense decreased\n4%, or $817,000, primarily due to a decrease in fees paid to national sales representation firms.\n\ne Publishing and other operations expenses, before depreciation and amortization, were essentially\nflat with an increase of $185,000, or less than 1%, to $37.6 million. Publishing payroll expense\nincreased $382,000, or 3%. Newsprint expense increased $105,000, or 2% primarily due to an\nincrease in the cost of newsprint. Newsprint cost per ton increased 3%, Paging expenses, before\ndepreciation and amortization, remained essentially unchanged in total for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2003 as compared to that of the prior year. These increases were offset by\ndecreases in various other expenses aggregating $290,000.\n\n* Corporate and administrative expenses, before depreciation and amortization, increased 51% to\n$8.5 million with increased payroll related costs and professional fees accounting for the majority\nof the overall increase. The increase in compensation related costs was due to increased\ncompensation for existing employees and the hiring of additional employees to help manage the\noperations of the stations acquired in the 2002 Acquisitions. The increase in other professional\nfees was due primarily to higher legal, accounting and banking fees.\n\ne Depreciation of property and equipment totaled $21.7 million and $15.6 million for the years\nended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Interest expense increased $7.7 million to $43.3 million. This increase is\nattributable to a higher total average debt balance in 2003 compared to 2002, mitigated somewhat by\nlower average interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. The total average debt balance was $657.0\nmillion and $453.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

WCAV-TV is the\nCompany's newly constructed television station in Charlottesville, Virginia which began operating in\nAugust of 2004. The increase in the purchases of property and equipment was partially offset by a\ndecrease in payments of $6.6 million on purchase liabilities.

The majority of these liabilities were paid during\n2003 with fewer similar payments being made during 2004.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $3.7 million due to lower repayments net of\nborrowings of long-term debt, increased dividends paid partially offset by increased proceeds from the\nissuance of Common Stock.

Durning 2003, an effort was made to accelerate the repayment of all such liabilities with above\nmarket interest rates. These efforts were completed in 2003 and no similar accelerated payments were\nmade in 2004. Dividends paid to Common Stock shareholders increased by $2.0 million due to an\nincrease in the dividend paid from $0.08 per share to $0.12 per share. Proceeds from the issuance of\nCommon Stock increased $2.9 million due largely to increased exercises of stock options by employees.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company purchased 65,000 shares of the Company's\nClass A Common Stock and 1,681,400 shares of the Company's Common Stock for a total of $22.4\nmillion.

The Company agreed in the settlement to forego certain claimed depreciation and amortization\ndeductions relating to the 1996 through 1999 tax years, which in turn resulted in a reduction of the\nCompany’s current federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards by approximately $16.3 million.\nDuring 2004 and as a result of the settlement, the Company collected a previously claimed federal tax\ncash refund for 1996 of approximately $1.1 million, plus statutory interest.\n\n38",

    "Page_55": "Valuation of FCC Licenses and Network Affiliation Agreements\n\nBroadcast licenses of television stations acquired by the Company prior to January 1, 2002 were\nvalued using a residual basis methodology (analogous to “goodwill”) where the excess of the purchase\nprice over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets was attributed to the broadcast\nlicense,\n\nThe Company values the broadcast licenses of any television station acquired after 2001 using an\nincome approach. Under this approach, a broadcast license is valued based on analyzing the estimated\nafter-tax discounted future cash flows of the station, assuming an initial start-up operation maturing into\nan average performing station in a specific television market and giving consideration to other relevant\nfactors such as the technical qualities of the broadcast license and the number of competing broadcast\nlicenses within that market. The Company adopted this methodology to value broadcast licenses as the\nCompany believes this methodology has, in recent years, become the methodology gencrally used within\nthe broadcast industry to value broadcast licenses.\n\nSome broadcast companies may use methods to value acquired broadcast licenses and their related\nnetwork affiliations different than those that are used by the Company. These different methods may\nresult in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast\ncompanies.\n\nThe Company believes that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes\nof its broadcast license, These attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network\nprogramming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network\nprogramming. These attributes and their impact on audiences can include:\n\ne The scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the FCC to a particular market determines how\nmany television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market,\n\n* The length of time the broadcast license has allowed a station to operate, Television stations that\nhave been broadcasting within a market for longer periods of time are generally viewed more\noften than newer television stations.\n\ne VHF stations (generally channels two to thirteen) are typically viewed more often than UHF\nstations (generally channels fifteen to sixty-nine) because (i) VHF stations have been\nbroadcasting longer than UHF stations, (ii) UHF signals are generally weaker than VHF signals\nand (iii) because historically, in the early years of UHF operations, UHF stations had\ndisadvantaged channel positions on TV receivers and cable systems compared to VHF stations.\n\ne The quality of the broadcast signal and geographic location of the broadcast station within a\nmarket impacts viewership, The viewership of a television station is influenced by a television\nstation’s physical location. As an example, the value of being licensed to the largest city within a\nmulti-city market has more value than being licensed to the smallest city within that market, A\nstation’s broadcast power level, antenna height and antenna location all influence the overall\nquality of a television signal and therefore potential viewership of the station. All of these\nattributes are ultimately controlled by the broadcast license issued by the FCC,\n\n© The audience acceptance of the broadcast licensee's local news programming and community\n\ninvolvement. A local television station’s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a\nmarket generally will provide a larger audience for its own network programming.\n\n43",
    "Page_56": "* ‘The quality of the other non-network programming carried by the television station. A local\ntelevision station’s syndicated programming that attracts the largest audiences in a market\ngenerally will provide larger audience lead-ins to its network programming.\n\nA local television station can be the number one station in a market, regardless of the national\nranking of its affiliated network, depending on these factors or attributes listed above, ABC, CBS, NBC\nand FOX each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest prime time audience in\nthe local market in which the station operates.\n\nSome broadcasting companies account for network affiliations as a significant component of the\nvalue of a station, These companies believe that stations are popular because they have generally been\naffiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts, stations with network affiliations have\nthe most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the\naudience for local syndicated programming. As a result, these broadcast companies allocate a significant\nportion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship.\n\nTn connection with the Company's purchase of Gray MidAmerica Television in October 2002 and of\nKOLO-TV in December 2002 the Company acquired 16 television stations serving 14 markets. The\nmethodology the Company used to value these stations was based on the Company’s evaluation of the\nbroadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated. The Company\nbelieves that in these specific markets the Company would be able to replace a network affiliation\nagreement with little or no economic loss to the television station. The Company bases this belief in part\non the following:\n\n* Ofthe 14 markets that these newly acquired stations operate in, 10 of these markets have four or\nfewer commercial television stations including the station owned by the Company. In the\nremaining four markets, the Company’s stations operate on VHF channels; see the discussion of\nVHF channels below. Also, in those four remaining markets the Company’s stations all rank\namong the top three most viewed stations in the market for both local news viewing and for\noverall viewing of programming; sce the discussion of audience viewing below. (The Company\ndefines a commercial television station as a commercial broadcast station that BIA has reported\nreceiving at least a 1% share of viewers, or more, in three of the four most recent rating periods.)\n\n© Ofthese 16 stations, the average length of time the broadcast license has allowed these stations to\noperate is 48 years with the shortest time period being 39 years and the longest time period being\n54 years, Generally, networks desire to affiliate with established stations that have performed at a\nhigh level over time, Each of the stations acquired in 2002 have been continuously affiliated with\nat least one of the following major networks, ABC, CBS or NBC, for substantially all of the years\nthe respective station has been broadcasting and have been consistently affiliated with the same\nmajor network on average for 42 years with the shortest time period being 17 years and the\nlongest time period being 50 years.\n\n* Of these 16 stations, 13 stations broadcast on VHF channels and three stations broadcast on UHF\nchannels. In the three markets in which the Company broadcasts on a UHF channel, there are\nfour or fewer commercial television stations including the station owned by the Company in the\nmarket (see the discussion of the number of stations in a market above),\n\n© Ofthese 14 markets, two are considered by the Company to be multi-city markets and cach of the\n\nCompany’s station’s are licensed to the largest city within the multi-city market. Generally, a\nnetwork would rather affiliate with a station that is licensed to the largest city within a multi-city\n\n44",
    "Page_57": "market, because there are likely to be more viewers interested in the local news product of that\nstation in comparison to stations licensed to smaller cities within the same market.\n\ne All 16 stations broadcast using power levels, antenna heights and antenna locations that produce\nhigh quality television signals that cover large geographic areas.\n\n@ Within these 14 markets, cach of the Company's stations rank among the top three viewed\nstations in each market for both local news and also for overall programming. More specifically,\nof the 16 stations, the stations’ local news programming ranking and the stations’ overall\naudience ranking within the station’s market was number one or two at 13 of the stations and\nnumber three at three of the stations. The stations that have a number three ranking are all in a\nsingle market and operate as a parent station with two satellite stations (to better service smaller\ntowns geographically distant from the primary station). (These audience rankings are based upon\nthe Company's review of market data for the November, July, May and February 2004 rating\nperiods.)\n\nGiven the Company’s assumptions and the specific attributes of the stations the Company acquired\nin 2002 (see discussion above), the Company ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network\naffiliation relationship in each market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another\nnetwork and the value of any terms of the affiliation agreement that were more favorable or unfavorable\nthan those generally prevailing in the market.\n\nCertain other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the\naffiliation and not the other attributes of the station, including its broadcast license, which contributes to\nthe operational performance of that station. As a result, the Company believes that these broadcasting\ncompanies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that the Company\nbelieves are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill.\n\nIf the Company were to assign higher values to all of its network affiliations and less value to its\nbroadcast licenses and if it is further assumed that such higher values of the network affiliations are\ndefinite lived intangible assets, this reallocation of value might have a significant impact on the\nCompany’s operating results. However, it should be noted that there is a diversity of practice and some\nbroadcast companies have considered such an intangible asset to have a life ranging from 15 to 40 years\ndepending on the specific assumptions utilized by those broadcast companies.\n\nThe following table reflects the hypothetical impact of the hypothetical reassignment of value from\nbroadcast licenses to network affiliations for all prior acquisitions of the Company (the first acquisition\nbeing in 1994) and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a hypothetical 15-year\n\n45",

Additionally, the Company has an aggregate of approximately $193\nmillion of various state operating loss carryforwards, The utilization of a significant portion of the net\noperating losses is limited on an annual basis due to a change in ownership of both the Company and\nGray MidAmerica Television, Management does not believe that these limitations will significantly\nimpact the Company’s ability to utilize the federal net operating losses before they expire. Limitations on\nutilization may apply to approximately $85.4 million of certain state operating loss carryforwards.\nAccordingly, a valuation allowance has been provided to account for the potential limitations on\nutilization of certain state tax benefits.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nValuation of Intangible Assets\n\nAt the September 2004 meeting of the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF\"), the Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC\") observer clarified the SEC Staff's position on the use of the residual\nmethod for valuation of acquired assets other than goodwill which is referred to as topic D-108. ‘The SEC\nStaff believes that the residual method does not comply with the requirements of SFAS No. 141 when\nused to value certain intangible assets that arise from legal or contractual rights. Accordingly, the SEC\nStaff believes that the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than\ngoodwill.

Impairment of intangible\nassets recognized upon application of an income approach, including the associated deferred tax effects,\nshould be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Early adoption of an\nincome approach is encouraged. As mentioned above, television broadcast licenses acquired by the\nCompany prior to January 1, 2002 were valued using the residual value methodology, Effective January\n1, 2005, the Company will adopt the provisions of this announcement and perform a valuation assessment\nof its Federal Communication Commission licenses using the income approach. The Company is\ncontinuing to evaluate the impact of the change in accounting principal. However, based on preliminary\nvaluation analysis reports from an independent third party, the Company does not expect that the adoption\nof this pronouncement will require the Company to record an impairment charge in the first quarter of\n2005,\n\nShare-Based Payment\n\nIn December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS\n123(R)), that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise\nreceives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that\nare based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of\nsuch equity instruments. SFAS 123(R) eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation\ntransactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,\nAccounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead that such transactions be\naccounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 123(R) to\ndetermine which fair-value-based model and transitional provision it will follow upon adoption. The\noptions for transition methods as prescribed in SFAS 123(R) include either the modified prospective or\nthe modified retrospective methods. The modified prospective method requires that compensation\nexpense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock as the requisite service is rendered\nbeginning with the first quarter of adoption, while the modified retrospective method would record\ncompensation expense for stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated.\nUnder the modified retrospective method, prior periods may be restated cither as of the beginning of the\nyear of adoption or for all periods presented. SFAS 123(R) will be effective for the Company beginning\nin its third quarter of fiscal 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of\nSFAS 123(R), based on options issued and outstanding at present, the Company expects that the expense\nwill be between $250,000 and $400,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005.\n\nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004\n\nOn October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”), The\nAct provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased\nin from 2005 through 2010.

    "Page_71": "A. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\n\nAs of December 31, 2004, the Company operated in three reportable segments: broadcasting,\npublishing and paging. The broadcasting segment consists of 30 television stations serving 26 markets in\n19 states. The publishing segment consists of five daily newspapers. Four of the five newspapers are\nlocated in Georgia and the fifth newspaper is located in Indiana. The paging segment consists of a\nwireless messaging and paging business operating in Georgia, Florida and Alabama, The Company’s\nexecutive offices are located in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All\nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nBroadcasting advertising revenue is generated primarily from the sale of television advertising time.\nBroadcast network compensation is generated by payments from the broadcast networks to the Company.\nPublishing revenue is gencrated primarily from circulation and advertising revenue, Paging revenue\nresults primarily from the sale of pagers, cellular telephones and related services. Advertising revenue is\nbilled to the customer and recognized when the advertisement is aired or published. Broadcast network\ncompensation is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract. The Company bills its\ncustomers in advance for newspaper subscriptions and paging services and the related revenues are\nrecognized over the period the service is provided on the straight-line basis. Revenue from the sale of\ncellular telephones and pagers is recognized at the time of sale.\n\nBarter Transactions\n\nThe Company accounts for trade barter transactions involving the exchange of tangible goods or\nservices with its customers, The revenue is recorded at the time the advertisement is broadcast and the\nexpense is recorded at the time the goods or services are used. The revenue and expense associated with\nthese transactions are based on the fair value of the asscts or services received, Trade barter revenue and\nexpense recognized by the Company for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as\nfollows (amounts in thousands):\n\n2004 __2003 2002\nTrade barter revenue $3,017 $ 2,988 $ 2,222\n‘Trade barter expense (2,945) _(2,915) _(2,164)\n\n$2 SB S358\n\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (the “FASB\") Statement No,\n63, Financial Reporting by Broadcasters, the Company does not account for barter revenue and related\nbarter expense generated from network programming. The Company does not account for barter revenue\nand related barter expense generated from syndicated programming. Management of the Company\nbelieves that barter revenue and related expense generated from syndicated programming is immaterial.\nFurthermore, any such barter revenue recognized would then require the recognition of an equal amount\nof barter expense, The recognition of these amounts would have no effect upon net income.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n59",
    "Page_72": "A. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts\nof cash and have a maturity of three months or less when purchased.\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\n\nThe Company records a provision for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of local revenue\nreceivables that are over sixty days old and a percentage of national revenue reccivables that are over\nninety days ald. The Company recorded expenses for this allowance of $613,000, $536,000 and\n$872,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.\n\nInventories\n\nInventories, principally newsprint and supplies, are stated at the lower of cost or market. The\nCompany uses the first-in, first-out method of determining costs for substantially all of its inventories.\n\nProgram Broadcast Rights\n\nRights to programs available for broadcast under program license agreements are initially recorded\nat the beginning of the license period for the amounts of total license fees payable under the license\nagreements and are charged to operating expense over the period that the episodes are broadcast. The\nportion of the unamortized balance expected to be charged to operating expense in the succeeding year is\nclassified as a current asset, with the remainder classified as a non-current asset. The liability for the\nlicense fees payable under the program license agreements is classified as current or long-term, in\naccordance with the payment terms of the various license agreements.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line\nmethod. Buildings, towers, improvements and equipment are generally depreciated over estimated useful\nlives of approximately 35 years, 20 years, 10 years and 5 years, respectively, Maintenance, repairs and\nminor replacements are charged to operations as incurred; major replacements and betterments are\ncapitalized. The cost of any assets sold or retired and related accumulated depreciation are removed from\nthe accounts at the time of disposition, and any resulting profit or loss is reflected in income or expense\nfor the period.\n\nDeferred Loan Costs\n\nLoan acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the applicable indebtedness using a straight-line\nmethod which approximates the effective interest method.\n\n60",
    "Page_73": "A. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\n109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SPAS 109\"). Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a\nchange in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date,\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nFASB Statement No, 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure,\nan amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 (“SFAS 148\"), amends the disclosure requirements of FASB\nStatement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (“SFAS 123”), to require more prominent\ndisclosure in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-\nbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.\n\nThe Company currently applies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\n(APB 25) and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Under APB 25,\ncompensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant, between the fair value of the\nCompany’s stock and the exercise price, Had compensation expense related to the Company's\noutstanding options been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with SFAS 123,\nnet income (loss) available to common stockholders and earnings per share would be as reflected below\n(in thousands, except per common share data):\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n2004 2003 2002\n\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders, as reported $ 41,013 $ 10,737 $(30,371)\nAdd: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in\n\nreported net income, net of related tax effects -O- -0- -\nDeduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense\n\ndetermined under fair value based method for all awards, net of\n\nrelated tax cffects (908) __ (1.477) (877)\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders, pro forma $ 40,105 $ 9,260 $§(31,248)\n\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders per share:\n\nBasic, as reported $ 083 $ O21 $ (1.37)\nBasic, pro forma $ 0.81 $ O18 $ (1.41)\nDiluted, as reported $ 082$ O21 $ (137)\nDiluted, pro forma s 0380 $ O18 § (141)\n\n61",
    "Page_74": "A. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nStock-Based Compensation (Continued)\n\nThe fair value for the options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively: risk-free\ninterest rates of 3.53%, 3.14% and 2.07%; dividend yields of 0.90%, 0.71% and 0.81%; volatility factors\nof the expected market price of the Company’s Common Stock of 0.30, 0.30 and 0.37; and a weighted-\naverage expected life of the options of 3.4, 4.1 and 4.5 years.\n\nAccounting for Derivatives\n\nThe Company may use swap agreemerits to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to a fixed rate\nbasis, thus hedging against interest rate fluctuations, These hedging activities may be transacted with one\nor more highly-rated institutions, reducing the exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by\nthe counter-party.\n\nAs of December 31, 2004, the Company is not engaged in any interest rate swap agrecments. During\n2003, the Company entered into four interest rate swap agreements which expired in November 2004.\nThese agreements converted a combined notional amount of $50.0 million of floating rate debt under the\nsenior credit facility to fixed rate debt, These swap agreements fixed the LIBOR component of the total\ninterest rate charged on this portion of the Company's debt at a weighted average fixed rate of 1.87%.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest differentials from the interest rate swap agreements as adjustments\nto interest expense in the period they occur. The differential paid or received as interest rates change is\nacerued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, The amount payable to, or receivable from,\ncounter-parties is included in liabilities or assets. The fair value of the swap agreements is recognized in\nthe financial statements as a current liability.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nThe Company provides print advertising and advertising air-time to national and local advertisers\nwithin the geographic areas in which the Company operates. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of\nthe customer’s financial condition, and generally advance payment is not required. Credit losses are\nprovided for in the financial statements and consistently have been within management's expectations.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 25% and 10% of the Company's broadcast\nrevenue was obtained from advertising sales to automotive and restaurant customers, respectively.\nAlthough, the Company's revenues could be affected by changes within these industries, this risk is in\npart mitigated by the diversity of companies from which these revenues are obtained. Furthermore, the\nCompany’s large geographic operating area partially mitigates the cffect upon the Company from\nregional economic changes.\n\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held by a single major financial institution; however,\nrisk of loss is mitigated by the size and the financial health of the institution.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was\n$694.5 million and $692.8 million, respectively.

Currently, the\nCompany does not anticipate settlement of long-term debt at other than book value, The fair value of\nother financial instruments classified as current asscts or liabilities approximates their carrying value.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding does not include unvested restricted shares. These shares, although classified as issued and\noutstanding, are considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in\nthe basic carnings per share calculation until the shares are vested.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the\nCompany incurred a net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change available to common\nstockholders. As a result, all common stock equivalents related to employee stock-based compensation\nplans, warrants and convertible preferred stock that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the\nfuture were not included in the computation of diluted eamings per share as they would have an\nantidilutive effect for the period.

    "Page_76": "A. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nInvestment in Broadcasting Company\n\nThe Company has an investment in Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. (“Tarzian\") whose principal business is the\nownership and operation of two television stations. The investment represents 33.5% of the total\noutstanding common stock of Tarzian (both in terms of the number of shares of common stock\noutstanding and in terms of voting rights), but such investment represents 73% of the equity of Tarzian\nfor purposes of dividends if paid as well as distributions in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or\nother sale of Tarzian. This investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting and reflected\nas a non-current asset. The Company has no commitment to fund operations of Tarzian and has neither\nrepresentation on Tarzian’s beard of directors nor any other influence over Tarzian’s management. The\nCompany believes the cost method is appropriate to account for this investment given the existence of a\nsingle voting majority shareholder, the lack of management influence and litigation concerning the\nTarzian shares. See Note J. “Commitments and Contingencies” for further discussion of the Tarzian\ninvestment.\n\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Intangible Assets\n\nApproximately $1,1 billion, or 79%, of the Company’s total assets as of December 31, 2004 consist\nof unamortized intangible assets, principally broadcast licenses and goodwill,\n\nEffective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\n142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142\"). SPAS 142 requires companies to\ndiscontinue amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Instead, SFAS\n142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives be reviewed for\nimpairment upon adoption of SFAS 142 and annually thereafter. The Company performs its annual\nimpairment review during the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that such assets might be impaired. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company recorded a one-\ntime, non-cash charge of approximately $39.9 million ($26.6 million after income taxes) to reduce the\ncarrying value of its goodwill and broadcast licenses. Such charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of\nan accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2002.\n\nThe Company has relatively few intangible asscts aside from its broadcast licenses and goodwill,\neach of which is an indefinite lived asset. Accordingly, upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002,\nthe Company ceased amortizing these assets, Other separately identified definite lived intangible assets\ninclude certain consulting and or non-compete agreements, advertising contracts, employment\nagreements, trademarks and network affiliation agreements.\n\nBroadcast licenses of television stations acquired by the Company prior to January 1, 2002 were\nvalued using a residual value methodology where the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of\nall identified tangible and intangible assets was attributed to the broadcast license.\n\nThe Company values the broadcast licenses of any television stations acquired after 2001 using an\nincome approach. Under this approach, a broadcast license is valued based on analyzing the estimated\nafter-tax discounted future cash flows of the station, assuming an initial start-up operation maturing into\nan average performing station in a specific television market and giving consideration to other relevant\nfactors such as the technical qualities of the broadcast license and the number of competing broadcast\nlicenses within that market.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Intangible Assets (Continued)\n\nCompany believes this methodology has, in recent years, become the methodology generally used within\nthe broadcast industry to value broadcast licenses.\n\nFor purposes of testing goodwill impairment, each of the Company's individual television stations\n\nand each of its individual newspapers is a separate reporting unit and its paging segment is one reporting\nunit.\n\nThe Company reviews the paging business, each newspaper and each television station acquired\nafter January 1, 2002 for possible goodwill impairment by comparing the estimated market value of each\nrespective reporting unit to the carrying value of that reporting unit’s net assets. If the estimated market\nvalues exceed the net assets, no goodwill impairment is deemed to exist. If the fair value of the reporting\nunit does not exceed the carrying value of that reporting unit’s net assets, goodwill impairment is deemed\nto exist. The Company then performs, on a notional basis, a purchase price allocation applying the\nguidance of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS\n141”) by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to the fair value of all tangible and identifiable\nintangible assets with residual fair value representing the implied fair value of goodwill of that reporting\nunit. The carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit is written down to this implied value.\n\nThe Company tests the broadcast license of any television station acquired after 2001 for impairment\nusing an income approach, which is consistent with the manner in which such licenses are valued when\nthey were acquired. As discussed above, prior to January 1, 2002 the Company valued the broadcast\nlicenses of its acquired television stations as the residual asset, analogous to “goodwill”. For those\ntelevision stations and paging segment, the Company tests the broadcast licenses for possible impairment\nby performing, on a notional basis, a purchase price allocation applying the guidance of SFAS 141 by\nallocating the reporting unit’s fair value to the fair value of all tangible and identifiable intangible assets\n(other than the license) with residual fair value representing the implied fair value of the license. If the\ncarrying value of the broadcast license exceeds the implied value, an impairment charge is recognized.\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements — Valuation of Intangible Assets of this note for clarification of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) Staff's position concerning the use of the residual\nmethod.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nValuation of Intangible Assets - At the September 2004 mecting of the Emerging Issues Task Force\n(“EITF\"), SEC Observer clarified the SEC Staff's position on the use of the residual method for valuation\nof acquired assets other than goodwill which is referred to as topic D-108. The SEC Staff believes that\nthe residual method does not comply with the requirements of SFAS No. 141 when used to value certain\nintangible assets that arise from legal or contractual rights. Accordingly, the SEC Staff believes that the\nresidual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill, Registrants\nshould apply the income approach to such assets acquired in business combinations completed after\nSeptember 29, 2004, and registrants who have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible\nassets for the purpose of impairment testing shall perform an impairment test using an income approach\non all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method no later than the beginning\nof their first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2004. Impairment of intangible assets recognized\nupon application of an income approach, including the associated deferred tax effects, should be recorded\nas a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

Effective January 1, 2005, the\nCompany will adopt the provisions of this announcement and perform a valuation assessment of its\nFederal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) licenses using the income approach, The Company is\ncontinuing to evaluate the impact of the change in accounting principal. However, based on preliminary\nvaluation analysis reports from an independent third party, the Company does not expect that the adoption\nof this pronouncement will require the Company to record an impairment charge in the first quarter of\n2005.\n\nShare-Based Payment - In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-\nBased Payment (SFAS 123(R)), that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in\nwhich an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or\n(b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled\nby the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS 123(R) eliminates the ability to account for share-\nbased compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board\n(APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead\nthat such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method, The Company is currently\nevaluating SFAS 123(R) to determine which fair-valuc-based model and transitional provision it will\nfollow upon adoption. The options for transition methods as prescribed in SFAS 123(R) include cither the\nmodified prospective or the modified retrospective methods, The modified prospective method requires\nthat compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock as the requisite\nservice is rendered beginning with the first quarter of adoption, while the modified retrospective method\nwould record compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period\nrestated. Under the modified retrospective method, prior periods may be restated cither as of the\nbeginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. SFAS 123(R) will be effective for the\nCompany beginning in its third quarter of fiscal 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate\nthe application of SFAS 123(R), based on options issued and outstanding at present, the Company expects\nthat the expense will be between $250,000 and $400,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005,\n\nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004 - On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs\nCreation Act of 2004 (the “Act”).

On December 18, 2002\nthe Company completed its acquisition of the assets of KOLO-TV, the ABC affiliate serving Reno,\nNevada,\n\nThe Company paid $516.5 million in aggregate cash consideration for Gray MidAmerica Television.\nThis amount included a base purchase price of $502.5 million plus certain net working capital\nadjustments of approximately $5.7 million and fees of $8.3 million associated with the transaction. The\nCompany funded the acquisition and related fees and expenses by issuing 30,000,000 shares of Gray\nCommon Stock (GTN) to the public for net proceeds of $232.7 million, issuing additional debt totaling\n$275.0 million and using cash on hand.\n\nFor advisory services rendered by Bull Run Corporation (“Bull Run”), a related party, in connection\nwith the merger, the Company paid an advisory fee of $5.0 million to Bull Run. This amount is included\nin the fees described above. The Company does not intend to engage Bull Run for any such advisory or\nsimilar services in the future.\n\nThe Company paid $41.9 million in cash consideration for KOLO-TV. This purchase price included\na base purchase price of $41.5 million and related fees of $400,000.

Long-term Incentive Plan\n\nOn September 16, 2002, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2002 Long Term Incentive\nPlan (the “2002 Incentive Plan”), which replaced the prior long-term incentive plan, the 1992 Long Term\nIncentive Plan. Originally, the 2002 Incentive Plan had 2.8 million shares of the Company’s Common\nStock reserved for grants to key personnel for (i) incentive stock options, (ii) non-qualified stock options,\n(iii) stock appreciation nights, (iv) restricted stock awards and (v) performance awards, as defined by the\n2002 Incentive Plan. On May 26, 2004, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the\n2002 Incentive Plan, which increased the number of shares reserved for issuance thereunder by two\nmillion shares to a total of 4.8 million shares, At December 31, 2004, 3.5 million shares were available\nfor issuance under the 2002 Incentive Plan. Shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding options or\nperformance awards are counted against the 2002 Incentive Plan's maximum shares while such options or\nawards are outstanding. Under the 2002 Incentive Plan, the options granted typically vest after a two-year\nperiod and expire three years after full vesting, However, options will vest immediately upon a “change\nin control” of the Company as such term is defined in the 2002 Incentive Plan. All options have been\ngranted at prices that approximate fair market value on the date of the grant. During 2003, the Company\ngranted 100,000 shares of restricted stock to the Company’s president of which 40,000 shares were fully\nvested as of December 31, 2004. During 2003 and in connection with this grant, the Company recorded a\nliability for unearned compensation of $1.4 million that is being amortized as an expense over the four-\nyear vesting period of the stock, The total amount of uncarmed compensation is equal to the market value\nof the shares as of the date of grant.\n\nOn May 14, 2003, the Company's shareholders approved a restricted stock plan for its Board of\nDirectors (the “Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan\"). The Company has reserved 1.0 million shares of the\nCompany’s Common Stock for issuance under this plan and as of December 31, 2004 there were 940,000\nshares available for award. The Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan replaces the Company's non-employee\ndirector stock option plan, Under the Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan, each director can be awarded up\nto 10,000 shares of restricted stock each calendar year. Under this plan, the Company granted 15,000 and\n45,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, in total, to its directors during 2004 and 2003, respectively.

    "Page_97": "J. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)\n\nThe Company has an equity investment in Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. (“Tarzian\"”) representing shares in\nTarzian which were originally held by the estate of Mary Tarzian (the “Estate”), As described more fully\nbelow, the Company's ownership of the Tarzian shares is subject to certain litigation.\n\nOn February 12, 1999, Tarzian filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southem District of\nIndiana against U.S, Trust Company of Florida Savings Bank as Personal Representative of the Estate,\nclaiming that ‘Tarzian had a binding and enforceable contract to purchase the Tarzian shares from the Estate.\nOn February 3, 2003, the Court entered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of Tarzian for breach of contract\nand awarding Tarzian $4.0 million in damages. The Court denied the Estate’s renewed motion for judgment\nas a matter of law, and alternatively, for a new trial on the issue of liability; denied Tarzian’s motion to\namend the judgment to award Tarzian specific performance of the contract and title to the Tarzian shares;\nand granted Tarzian's motion to amend the judgment to include pre-judgment interest on the $4.0 million\ndamage award, The Estate appealed the judgment and the Court’s rulings on the post-trial motions, and\n‘Tarzian cross-appealed. On February 14, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a\ndecision concluding that no contract was ever created between Tarzian and the Estate, reversing the\njudgment of the District Court, and remanding the case to the District Court with instructions to enter\njudgment for the Estate, On February 25, 2005, ‘Tarzian filed a petition for a rehearing. The Company\ncannot predict when the final resolution of this litigation will occur.\n\nOn March 7, 2003, Tarzian filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northem District of\nGeorgia against Bull Run Corporation and the Company for tortious interference with contract and\nconversion. The lawsuit alleges that Bull Run Corporation and Gray purchased the Tarzian shares with\nactual knowledge that Tarzian had a binding agreement to purchase the stock from the Estate. The\nlawsuit secks damages in an amount equal to the liquidation value of the interest in Tarzian that the stock\nrepresents, which Tarzian claims to be as much as $75 million, as well as attormeys’ fees, expenses, and\npunitive damages, The lawsuit also secks an order requiring the Company and Bull Run Corporation to\ntum over the stock certificates to Tarzian and relinquish all claims to the stock. The stock purchase\nagreement with the Estate would permit the Company to make a claim against the Estate in the event that\ntitle to the Tarzian Shares is ultimately awarded to Tarzian. There is no assurance that the Estate would have\nsufficient assets to honor any or all of such potential claims. The Company filed its answer to the lawsuit on\nMay 14, 2003 denying any liability for Tarzian’s claims. On February 23, 2005, the Court granted the\nparties’ consent motion staying discovery pending a ruling from the Seventh Circuit on any petition for\nrehearing filed by Tarzian in the Indiana litigation referenced above. The Company believes it has\nmeritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. The Company cannot predict when the\nfinal resolution of this litigation will occur.\n\nK.
