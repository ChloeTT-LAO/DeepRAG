    "Page_21": "1.3. Community Context\n\nHistory\n\nCalgary is located within the traditional territories of the Treaty Seven\n\nation of Alberta, Region 3.\n\nFor more than 11,000 years, the confluence of the Bow\nand Elbow rivers has been important for Indigenous\npeoples. The escarpment overlooking these rivers,\n\nthe North Hill, is located along an ancient north-south\ncorridor known as the Old North Trail, where Indigenous\npeoples have lived, loved, raised families, travelled and\ntraded. With its sheltering river flats, plentiful wood\n\nand water and warm Chinook winds in the winter, the\nCalgary area was a preferred seasonal campsite.\n\n \n\nAs a permanently settled place, Calgary began in 1875\nas a North-West Mounted Police post. By the time the\nCanadian Pacific Railway (CPR) arrived in 1883, Calgary\nhad developed as an unincorporated settlement on the\nfuture site of the Inglewood neighbourhood. The CPR\nlaid out a new townsite on its own property in what\n\nis now downtown and the settlement moved west at\nthe beginning of 1884. Calgary was incorporated as\n\na town later that year and in 1894 it became a city.\n\nBefore two large annexations added considerably to\nCalgary's footprint in 1907 and 1910, the site of the\nfuture North Hill Communities lay outside the municipal\nboundaries. Beginning in the 1880s, the area was settled\nby homesteaders who obtained their farms through the\nDominion Lands Act. The open space of Fox Hollow is a\nremnant of that agricultural period. As late as the 1940s,\nit was the site of the East Mount Pleasant Dairy Farm.\n\nThe North Hill Communities area was also a transit\ncorridor. In the manner of the Old North Trail, the\nCalgary-Edmonton Trail became Calgary's lifeline to the\nnorth. In 1873, Reverend John McDougall cut a new\npath between Edmonton and his Methodist mission\n\nat Morley. The new trail was extended to Calgary in\n1875 and its route was surveyed and finalized in 1886.\nIt became known as Edmonton Trail to those travelling\nnorth and as Calgary Trail to those travelling south.\nBefore the original wood-truss bridge was completed in\n\nNorth Hill Communities Local Area Plan\n\nations. This includes: the Blackfoot Confederacy, made up of the Siksika,\nPiikani and Kainai First Nations; the lyaxe Nakoda First Nations, comprised\nof the Chiniki, Bearspaw and Wesley First Nations; and the Tsuut'ina First\nation. Calgary is also home to the historic Northwest Métis and to Métis\n\n1890 at what is now the site of the Reconciliation Bridge,\ntravellers forded the Bow River or crossed by ferry.\n\nRegular mail and stagecoach services began along the\nCalgary-Edmonton Trail in 1883. The trail’s significance\ndiminished in 1891 with the completion of the\nCalgary and Edmonton Railway, a CPR subsidiary.\n\nThe new branch line crossed through the future\n\nsites of Renfrew, Winston Heights-Mountview and\nGreenview Industrial. Passenger service ended in\n1985, but the line remains in use for freight service.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, Calgary experienced\nan economic and population boom that saw\n\nit transformed into a regional wholesale and\ndistribution centre. Speculators began purchasing\nfarmland outside the city limits and registering\nsubdivision plans. In 1906, Oscar G. Devenish (best\nremembered for building the Devenish Apartments,\nan extant Beltline landmark) acquired part of the\nfuture Capitol Hill site and Archibald John McArthur\nregistered the Crescent Heights subdivision.\n\nThe 1907 annexation gave Calgary a beachhead north\nof the Bow, including portions of Crescent Heights and\nRenfrew south of 8 Avenue N. Though most of Crescent\nHeights lay outside the new city limits, McArthur\npromoted his subdivision and he built the original\nCentre Street Bridge that year as a private venture.\n\nIn 1908, residents organized the Village of Crescent\nHeights, which had its own municipal council, school\nboard, village constable and volunteer fire brigade.\nBesides McArthur's subdivision, the village included\nportions of the future Mount Pleasant, Renfrew,\nTuxedo Park and Winston Heights/Mountview. Before\nlong, villagers petitioned for annexation to Calgary.\n\n1 Visualizing Growth 1 5",

From University of Calgary Libraries and Cultural Resources Digital Collections\n\n16\n\nThe 1910 annexation involved a massive area that\nincluded the Village of Crescent Heights and the\nbalance of the North Hill Communities area. The Calgary\nMunicipal Railway, which had been inaugurated in\n1909, was a key factor that accelerated and shaped\nearly growth. Homebuilders gravitated toward\n\nareas close to streetcar routes and streetcars made\ncommercial uses feasible beyond the city centre. Early\nsubdivisions clustered around the streetcar lines and\nshared similar features including grid street networks\nfronted with boulevard trees and landscaped yards.\n\nBesides Capitol Hill and Crescent Heights, pre-First\nWorld War subdivisions included Mountview, Rosedale\nand Tuxedo Park, as well as the former subdivisions\n\nof Balmoral (which now lies within Tuxedo Park),\nBeaumont and Regal Terrace (now part of Renfrew),\nthe original Mount Pleasant (now part of Crescent\nHeights), North Balmoral (now Highland Park), Highbury\n(divided between Capitol Hill, Mount Pleasant and\nRosemont), Pleasant Heights (divided between Capitol\nHill and Mount Pleasant) and Ree Heights (divided\nbetween Greenview Industrial, Highland Park and\n\n1 Visualizing Growth\n\nWinston Heights/Mountview). Some were developed\nwhile others remained lightly settled or speculative.\n\nThe city’s pre-First World War boom ended in 1913 and\nCalgary grew modestly in the decades that followed.\nIts built area contracted in the 1920s through a City\nprogram that subsidized the cost of house-moving and\nencouraged property owners in outlying areas to swap\ntheir land for inner-city lots. After the Second World\nWar, Calgary experienced significant urban growth\nsupported by returning veterans, European immigration,\ngovernment incentives and the late-1940s oil boom.\nThis resulted in new residential development both in\nestablished neighbourhoods and new subdivisions\nsuch as Winston Heights and Thorncliffe-Greenview.\n\nLike Bowness, Forest Lawn, Mission and Montgomery,\nCrescent Heights is one of Calgary's few neighbourhoods\nthat was once an independent municipality. It remains\n\na diverse inner-city neighbourhood bisected by the\nCentre Street commercial district and bounded to\n\nthe north by 16 Avenue.

It\n\n1 Visualizing Growth\n\n \n\n“16th Avenue NW, Calgary, Alberta’, 1920.\nCourtesy of Glenbow Archives, NA-3774-55,\nArchives and Special Collections, University of Calgary\n\nwas renamed the Elks Golf Club in 1969 and\nit continues as the Winston Golf Club. Nearby\nFox Hollow Golf Course opened in 1990.\n\nThorncliffe-Greenview is the union of two separate\nneighbourhoods that originated in the 1950s. Both\nare bisected by McKnight Boulevard, which forms the\nnorthern boundary of the North Hill Communities.\nThorncliffe began in 1954 as Thorncliffe Heights and it\nwas the first Calgary neighbourhood created through\na private contract that assigned the cost of utilities,\nstreets and sidewalks to the developer. The small\nportion of Thorncliffe that lies within the North Hill\nCommunities area comprises four blocks of detached\nhouses between Laycock Drive and McKnight Boulevard\nNW, a commercial strip along Centre Street (including\nthe Northgate Shopping Centre, built in 1958) and\npart of Highland Valley Park. The Thorncliffe Heights\nCommunity Association was founded in 1956.\n\nGreenview was approved in 1959 and developed\nby 1961, when Greenview Elementary School\nopened and the city’s first rowhousing project\n\nwas completed in the neighbourhood. Greenview\nresidents joined the community association in\nneighbouring Thorncliffe. By 1967, it was renamed\nthe Thorncliffe-Greenview Community Association.\n\nGreenview Industrial, which opened in 1960, followed\na pattern established in 1954 when The City developed\nCalgary's first industrial park in Manchester. Early\nlandmarks included the Sunset Drive-In (which\nopened in 1950, predating the industrial park), the\nAirliner Motor Hotel and Golden Acre Nurseries. In\n1976, Calgary Transit relocated to its expansive new\nSpring Gardens complex in Greenview Industrial.\n\nNorth Hill Communities Local Area Plan",
    "Page_25": "Transportation development and settlement patterns\ncontributed to the early emergence of Main Streets\nin the North Hill Communities, including Edmonton\nTrail, 16 Avenue N, Centre Street and 4 Street NW.\n\nAsa city street, Edmonton Trail retained its historic\nname as well as its function as a significant transit\ncorridor. In 1911, it became part of the Crescent Heights\nstreetcar loop as well as the Tuxedo Park extension\n\nline to the north. The street developed quickly as a\nmixed-use residential and commercial street. After the\nSecond World War, the Calgary Transit System (as the\nCalgary Municipal Railway was renamed) converted its\nstreetcar system to a network of electric trolley coach\nroutes (for trunk lines) and bus routes (for shorter\ndistances). Trolley coaches were rubber-wheeled like\nbuses; however, like streetcars, they required overhead\nelectric trolley wires. The Crescent Heights route,\nwhich included Edmonton Trail between the Bow\nRiver and 16 Avenue N, became Calgary's first electric\ntrolley coach route in 1947. In 1958, trolley wires were\nextended north on Edmonton Trail to 37 Avenue\n\nNE. Diesel buses replaced trolley coaches in 1974.\n\nSouth of the Bow River, Centre Street was originally\naligned with the CPR station in a typical CPR townsite\npattern. The City’s purchase of the private Centre Street\nBridge in 1912 and construction of the present bridge\nin 1916-17 projected the street's Main Street function,\nincluding mixed-use residential and commercial\ndevelopment, north of the Bow River. Streetcar service\nextended across the bridge to 4 Avenue N in 1917, to\n20 Avenue N in 1919 and, ultimately, to 32 Avenue N.\nTrolley coaches replaced streetcars in 1947, initially\n\nto 36 Avenue N and, in 1957, to Northmount Drive.\n\n16 Avenue N follows a section line that was surveyed\n\nin the early 1880s. It formed the northern boundary\n\nof the short-lived Village of Crescent Heights and\n\nit developed as a mixed-use Main Street before its\nannexation to Calgary in 1910. The avenue formed part\nof the street railway’s Crescent Heights loop as well as\nthe later Centre Street line and Capitol Hill extensions.\nIt became part of the first trolley coach line in 1947. In\n1954, 16 Avenue N was designated as part of the Trans-\nCanada Highway, which was officially dedicated in 1962.\nCompletion of the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium\nin 1957 and North Hill Mall in 1959 contributed\n\nto the modern development of 16 Avenue N.\n\n4 Street NW developed as a residential street by\n1912. After 1919, it was included in a new streetcar\nloop that formed along with Centre Street, 12\nAvenue NW and 20 Avenue NW. In 1947, 4 Street\nbecame part of a new trolley coach line from 12\nAvenue to 26 Avenue NW. It was extended to 32\nAvenue in 1955 and to Northmount Drive in 1958.\n\nMore recently, Deerfoot Trail was developed in the\n1970s and 1980s along the eastern edge of the\nNorth Hill Communities as a freeway and provincial\nhighway. The Nose Creek Pathway, a cycling and\npedestrian path, was introduced in the mid-1980s.\n\nHistoric peak population for many of the North Hill\nCommunities was reached by the late 1960s. Today,\nthe North Hill Communities comprises nine residential\ncommunities and Greenview Industrial. These\ncommunities have their own individual boundaries\nand community associations but are united by shared\namenities, schools, urban and neighbourhood Main\nStreets, Activity Centres, public infrastructure, transit,\nnatural areas and regional and neighbourhood parks.\n\n \n\n“First streetcar to cover route to Crescent Heights’, 1911.\nGlenbow Archives, NA-2891-11,\nArchives and Special Collections, University of Calgary\n\nNorth Hill Communities Local Area Plan\n\n“Better homes for’54, Calgary, Alberta’, 1954.\nCourtesy of Glenbow Archives, NA-5600-6668g,\nArchives and Special Collections, University of Calgary\n\n1 Visualizing Growth",

Steep\nescarpments form the south and east boundaries of the\narea, sloping down to the Bow River and Nose Creek\nrespectively. Gentle slopes grade toward Confederation\nPark, a regional drainage route for stormwater, in the\nnorthwest plan area. Water draining to Confederation\nCreek flows east and north into Nose Creek.\n\n \n\nNatural Features and Areas Photo: McHugh Bluff\n\nThe Plan area includes a number of natural areas, parks\nand open spaces. Natural areas include Nose Creek,\nlocated along the eastern edge of the plan area, the\nBow River, located along the south and two significant\nescarpment areas. These natural areas provide\necological value within the city and allow for context-\nappropriate leisure and recreational opportunities.\nThe North Hill Communities also include a number\n\nof major, minor and local parks, most significant\n\nof which is Confederation Park, a 160-hectare park\nwhich offers a rich mix of activities and amenities in a\nnaturalized setting.\n\n \n\nUrban Forest\n\nThe mature tree canopy is both an important asset\nand defining character element for the North Hill\nCommunities. This canopy is comprised of trees on\nprivately landscaped parcels as well as along public\nstreets within boulevards. Some of these boulevards,\nparticularly along the avenues south of 16 Avenue\n\nN, are identified as heritage boulevards due to their\nhistorical importance to the wider communities.\n\n \n\nPhoto: Heritage boulevard in Crescent Heights\n\n20 1 Visualizing Growth North Hill Communities Local Area Plan",

    "Page_33": "2.1.1 Future Growth Concept\n\nThe Future Growth Concept set out in this Plan\nenvisions accommodating growth and change in\n\nkey strategic areas as identified in the MDP, through\nplanning and technical analysis and stakeholder\nengagement conducted in the drafting of the Plan. This\nvision builds upon the area's existing characteristics\nand attributes and also sets the foundation to support\ninvestment in increased mobility options, including the\nGreen Line LRT and Max Orange BRT.\n\nThe Plan envisions the area’s four Main Streets\nsupporting high levels of activity and including a broad\nrange of commercial and residential functions. Activity\nlevels will be accommodated through well-designed\nbuildings that support a high-quality public realm\nand street experience. These are, and will continue\n\nto be, the streets with the greatest number of people\nstrolling down them, enjoying shops and restaurants\non wide sidewalks with a public realm that offers\nopportunities to sit, socialize and watch street life.\n\nThe Green Line LRT will run down one of these Main\nStreets, Centre Street N, and the Plan envisions this\ncorridor and transit station areas accommodating\nincreased intensity of both residential and commercial\nland use functions as well as higher building scales\nthan the surrounding residential areas.\n\nThe Max Orange BRT also runs through the Plan area\nwith several stops located along 16 Avenue N. The Plan\nprovides policy direction around BRT stations on 16\nAvenue N primarily through the Main Streets policies\nin Sections 2.5.1.\n\nThe Future Growth Concept also envisions Activity\nCentres and important east-west corridors such\n\nas 20 Avenue N, 12 Avenue N and 8 Avenue N as\naccommodating more moderate growth in the form of\nprimarily residential, low scaled buildings of generally\nup to four to six storeys. These areas will provide\nincreased housing options within the North Hill\nCommunities and support locally focused businesses\nand community amenities.\n\n \n\nThe future vision for growth for the North Hill\nCommunities is represented on Map 3: Urban Form\nand Map 4: Building Scale.\n\nNorth Hill Communities Local Area Plan\n\nTogether, these two maps indicate where future\ngrowth and activity would be focused in the Plan area\nand define the general function for different parts of\nthe North Hill Communities. These two maps need to\nbe read together to understand the type and scale of\ndevelopment that is appropriate in the Plan area. The\nspecific urban form categories and building scales\n\nfor locations within the North Hill Communities are\ndescribed in relation to the overall vision in the policy\nsections that address each of the distinct geographic\nparts of the North Hill Communities plan area.\n\nMap 3: Urban Form illustrates the general location\n\nof urban form categories and the block pattern in\n\nthe Plan area. Together these elements describe the\nprimary community functions/land uses (housing,\ncommercial, industrial, regional campus, parks,\n\ncivic and recreation and natural areas) and policy\nconsideration for the Plan area. Policies for each of\nthe urban form categories is provided in Section 2.2\nUrban Form Categories and must be read together\nwith locally specific policies for Main Streets, Activity\nCentres, transit station areas and Greenview Industrial\nwhere applicable.\n\nMap 4: Building Scale illustrates the general building\nheight and massing within the Plan area which\nsupports the primary functions shown in Map 3: Urban\nForm.

    "Page_34": "2.2 Urban Form Categories\n\n \n\nThis Plan identifies the location of urban form\ncategories in Map 3: Urban Form. These urban form\ncategories identify and categorize the purpose and\ngeneral function (land use) of different parts of a\ncommunity. The relationship between the urban form\ncategories demonstrate how the different areas of a\ncommunity relate to and support each other.\n\nPeople’s personal journeys within the community\n\nare the foundation of these urban form categories,\nestablishing what people do in different parts of a\ncommunity.

Community activity level is important for visualizing how\nour communities function and informs the planning process.\n\n2 Enabling Growth\n\nAs people come in and out\nof their homes, walk around,\n\ndestination, local residential\nstreets are generally less active.\n\nPeople gather, shop, eat and\nlinger on Main Streets, generally\n\nhigh activity areas, while places where fewer people go\nare lower activity areas. Despite the difference in overall\nactivity level in different communities, the structure is\nstill similar. There are places where activity is focused in\na community, such as a Main Street and places that are\nless active, such as a local residential street.\n\nThere are ten urban form categories that direct land\nuse and built form in the North Hill Communities.

Reuse of existing structures, for example, can provide\nsignificant energy savings while historic structures and districts can stimulate commercial activity and increase tourism\n\nactivity and spending.\n\nHeritage takes various forms in the North Hill Communities. These include historic buildings that may be formally\nrecognized on the Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources, heritage boulevards such as those identified on Map\n2: Community Characteristics and Attributes, as well as individual buildings and clusters of character homes (heritage\nassets) within heritage guideline areas. This section provides policy for heritage in the North Hill Communities.\n\n2.6.1\nHeritage Resources\n\nHeritage resources are defining characteristics of\ncommunities and should be retained or protected\nwhile balancing the ability to redevelop. New\ndevelopment within the context of heritage\nresources should consider opportunities to balance\nboth new and historic forms of development. The\nCity of Calgary recognizes that there are Heritage\nResources other than buildings that include\narchaeological and culturally significant areas.\n\nPolicy\n\na.

The North Hill Communities Plan Area has four\nMain Streets: Centre Street N, Edmonton Trail NE,\n16 Avenue N and 4 Street NW. These Main Streets\nare often at the heart of communities, form the\nborder between communities and provide many\nof the primary transit routes, including the future\nGreen Line LRT. Calgary's Main Streets are vibrant\nby design and often allow for a wider variety of\nuses and mixed housing options, to support higher\ndensity of development necessary to support\nthat variety of uses. To reach their full potential,\nCalgary's Main Streets need both public and\nprivate investment with the shared goal of giving\nresidents the choice to travel less and live more by\nproviding the things they need right in their own\ncommunities. Coordinated design will support the\nefficient use of investment by reducing the need\nto reconstruct the public realm as redevelopment\noccurs, provide a safe public realm space that\nis accessible (e.g., through consistent materials,\npredictable placement of streetscape elements) and\nimprove the public realm in a phased approach that\nwill add to the vibrancy of a Main Street. To support\nMain Streets in the North Hill Communities, the\nfollowing should be considered:\n\ni. improve the quality of the public\nrealm and accessibility of Main Streets\nthrough streetscape improvements;\n\nii. undertake streetscape master plans that\nare designed to support the activity levels\nenvisioned in this Plan and ensure construction\nis undertaken in a coordinated fashion;\n\niii. create Main Streets that are attractive\nand visually appealing; and,\n\niv. provide an enhanced public realm that\nprioritizes the creation of comfortable spaces\nfor people to sit, gather, enjoy and walk.\n\nNorth Hill Communities Local Area Plan",

At the local level the natural environment begins\nwhen a person steps out their door, with trees, possibly\nproviding habitat, on private lots and in the boulevard.\nThe tree canopy within the North Hill Communities is\nwell established and thus protection and maintenance\nof trees on both public and private lands is a priority.\nThis environment then extends along green boulevards\nand eventually connects to the network of parks and\nnatural areas which include riparian areas, Nose Creek,\nescarpments and other features which contribute to\necological health and a sense of personal well-being\nwithin the Plan area.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe following objectives are intended to guide\ndecisions for supporting growth and Greening\nthe City in the North Hill Communities.\n\n= Protect, maintain and enhance the tree canopy on\npublic and private lands throughout the plan area.\n= Support the planting of trees using methods\nthat will ensure the sustainability and longevity\nof new trees to reach full canopy size.\n= Protect, maintain and enhance riparian\nareas along the creeks to facilitate wildlife\nmovement, biodiversity and creek health\nwhile improving resilience to erosion,\nflooding and water quality impacts.\n\nNorth Hill Communities Local Area Plan\n\nImplementation Options\n\nThe following are intended to identify specific actions\nto achieve the supporting growth objectives:\n\nUrban Forest\n\na. Calgary's urban forests provide important ecosystem\nfunctions including improving air quality, reducing\nstormwater runoff, providing shade and cooling,\nwildlife habitats and creating stress-reducing\nenvironments for residents. The MDP recognizes the\nimportance of the urban forest and identifies a tree\ncanopy coverage target of 14-20% across the city.\nOver the last ten years, the North Hill Communities\nhave experienced a slight decrease in overall canopy\ncoverage and currently sits at 15%.\n\nTo achieve and maintain a healthy, sustainable urban\nforest and meet tree canopy targets, it is critical that\nThe City, developers and residents contribute to\nconsistent and continuing urban forest management\nby protecting existing private and public trees\nwherever possible, planting the right trees in the\nright location and in the right way and maintaining\nall trees in good health. This Plan establishes a\n\ntree canopy coverage target for the North Hill\nCommunities of 16.5% by 2030. To meet this target,\nthe following actions should be implemented (in\naddition to the general policies in Chapter 2):\n\ni. protect trees on public and private lands\nwherever possible from removal due to\ndevelopment, root impact due to construction or\nother activities and unnecessary canopy pruning;\n\nii. provide additional tree plantings in public\nboulevards and ensure sustainable planting\ninfrastructure, sufficient soil volume and\nadequate moisture particularly on arterial and\ncommercial roads for large canopy growth in\nthe long-term;\n\niii. create tree planting programs for private lands;\n\niv. protect, maintain and enhance the ordered,\nregular planting design in heritage\nboulevards; and,\n\nv. invest in ongoing maintenance and lifecycle\n\nof public trees.\n\n \n\n3 Supporting Growth 9 7",

The maps\nare based on, but also inform, The Always Available for All Ages & Abilities (5A) Map of the Calgary Transportation Plan\n(CTP) and show existing and recommended connections identified in the CTP at the local area plan level.\n\nImprovements to the mobility network will prioritize pedestrians and cyclists where possible, by providing accessible\npathway and bikeway connections between the communities and to local and regional destinations. This includes\nsupporting the Future Growth Concept with appropriate facilities in the public right-of-way. Improvements identified\non Maps C1 and C2 will take time and will be phased as budget allows, subject to technical feasibility. This map is\nintended to compliment and inform the implementation options identified in Section 3.2.3 Connecting the City as well\nas future mobility improvements and investment.\n\nThe recommended pedestrian corridors depicted on Map C1: Pedestrian Corridors inform specific streets where an\nenhanced pedestrian realm space is desired. An enhanced pedestrian realm may include elements such as wider\nsidewalks, furniture zones, seating, plantings and other features that support the envisioned street activity and the\nFuture Growth Concept. All other streets, without the recommended pedestrian corridor designation, will still provide\nstandard residential sidewalks to create a complete walking network.\n\nThe recommended cycling network conceptually shown on Map C2: Cycling Network identifies corridors, not specific\nstreets. The map is not intended to make any recommendation about the specific type of cycling connection that\nwould be built, but rather the conceptual locations for those connections. The Future Growth Concept and existing\nright-of-way space will be used to refine the location of the specific cycling connection and help determine the type of\nfacility/infrastructure to be built.\n\n \n\nAppendices North Hill Communities Local Area Plan",
