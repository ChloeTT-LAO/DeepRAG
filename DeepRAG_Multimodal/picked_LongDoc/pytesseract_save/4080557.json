The dynamics of an ever-\nchanging social order is producing a new\ntype of citizenry who are more astute and\ncorrespondingly have greater expectations in\nterms of the quality and quantity of services\nwhich they now demand. This development\ncoincides with a period where it is universally\naccepted that there is a need to bridge the\ndivide between the haves and haves nots as\na prerequisite for the maintenance of social\norder, social justice, social equity and social\ncohesion. The demands of creating a more\ninclusive society mandate that those who live\nunder extreme conditions of poverty and\ndeprivation are provided with better access to\nmarkets and_ institutions, health care\nservices, educational opportunities, greater\njob security and access to productive assets\nin order to effect both a qualitative and\nquantitative shift in their standards of living.\n\nThe failure of any society to do so invariably\nrenders the poor and _ defenseless\nsusceptible to the shocks caused by life’s\ncycle of changes, economic reforms and\nother types of events such as illness. The\nvulnerability of the poor to socio-economic\nshocks can be reduced by policies that\nprotect their livelihoods, increase their\nhuman capital and assist them in times of\ncrisis. Although economic growth is a critical\n\nfactor in the promotion of better standards of\nliving, it has not been proven that economic\ngrowth is a sufficient condition to promote\nsocial development and to increase equality.\nPockets of poverty can persist due to the\ninability of some population groups to\nparticipate in the growth process.\nConsequently, protection mechanisms\nagainst poverty, destitution and uncertainties\nare needed in order to safeguard the\nvulnerable segments of the population\nagainst contingencies and uncertainties.\n\nUnquestionably poverty is a social ill which\ncan be explosive. Therefore incidence of\npoverty must be reduced. It is in keeping\nwith this broad overall objective of reducing\npoverty that the social policy programme has\nevolved. The role of social security policies\nis primarily to provide some form of safety net\nto vulnerable sectors but more importantly to\nprovide some level of protection against\nincreased deprivation and the promotion of\nbetter chances for individual survival. In this\nsense social protection policies address not\nonly the negative outcomes of development\nbut also promote more equal opportunities\namongst all population groups, thereby\nreducing the likelihood of negative outcomes.\n\nWhen the National Insurance Corporation\nwas formed in 1970, the philosophy\nunderscoring its creation was the need to\nprovide these safety nets for the vulnerable\nsectors of the population. Its creation was\nalso spurred by the realization that the\nsociety had a moral obligation to care for the\nleast fortunate and there was a need for the",
    "Page_7": "establishment of a mechanism which would\nenable the cost for the provision of social\nservices to be shared by the state, its citizens\nand other social partners.\n\nFrom its inception the Corporation has been\nsynonymous with the provision of social\nsecurity benefits and generations of Saint\nLucians have benefited from the wide range\nof services that the Corporation has provided\nthrough the years. However, cognizant of the\nchanging times the National Insurance\nCorporation has been involved in a\ncontinuous process of redefining its role and\nfunctions in order to better meet the needs of\nthe public that it serves.\n\nThrough the years, the National Insurance\nCorporation has developed Va}\nunquestionable reputation among a wide\ncross-section of the Saint Lucian populace\nfor the significant contribution it has made\nand continues to make towards the overall\ndevelopment of Saint Lucia. Today, the\nCorporation is viewed as an indispensable\npartner in the overall developmental\nframework of the island.\n\nThe National Insurance Corporation has left\nits imprint on many aspects of Saint Lucian\nlife and society. It is the largest single\ncontributor to domestic saving. In this regard\nit provides a pool of long-term savings that\ncan be utilized to finance socio-economic\ndevelopment. Its contribution to overall\nliquidity has made possible investments in\nhousing, education, tourism, the fishing\nindustry, professional services, agriculture\n\nand social infrastructure. Consequently, the\nNational Insurance Corporation has\nfunctioned as a major engine of growth and\ndevelopment within the context of the Saint\nLucian Economy.\n\nTruly the National Insurance Corporation is a\nmodel institution. It has provided leadership\nand partnership in the task of nation building.\nIt is my hope that this noble Saint Lucian\ninstitution grows from strength to strength\nand remains a permanent fixture in the social\nand economic landscape of our country.\n\nCn ane\n\nDr Kenny D.

The thrust for this year was\nplaced on getting the new Surgi -theatre at the\nVictoria Hospital completed and operational.\nThis new theatre was a gift to the People of St.\nLucia on the occasion of the country’s 25th\nIndependence Anniversary.\n\nThe NIC also played a pivotal role in getting\nthe much talked about Universal Health Care\nProgram to its present stage where it has\nbecome a topic of common house hold\ndiscussions.\n\nIn addition, the NIC worked steadfastly along\nside the Board of Directors of Blue Coral Ltd\nto commence the refurbishment and\nremodeling of the Blue Coral Building. The\nfinal product we all expect will assist in\nrejuvenating the main city centre of our nation.\n\nDuring the year under review we continued to\nremain focused on the core business of the\nNIC which is the collection of contributions and\nthe payment of benefits. The Corporation\nplaced much effort on collecting arrears of\ncontributions. Much focus was also placed on\nthe building of our investment portfolios.\n\nInvestments\n\nFor the year 2004/05 the local financial\ninstitutions continued to experience high\nliquidity, which resulted in low interest rates.\nThe Board & Investment Committee however,\ncontinued to employ sound strategies in\ninvesting the funds of our contributors. The\nCorporation was very prudent in_ its\ninvestments and always ensured that all\ninvestments would add value to its portfolio.\nThe following are the investments undertaken\nduring the period under review:-\n\n1. Purchased $5 million of 5-year\nGovernment of Saint Lucia Notes\n(yielding 5.79%) and $29 million of\n10-year Government of Saint Lucia\nBonds (yielding 7%) by converting\n$12 million of Government of Saint\nLucia Treasury Bills and paying $22\nmillion.\n\n2.

If persons understand the\nsystem, they would understand its mission and\nits raison d’etre. Over the years, different\ninitiatives have been implemented with varying\ndegrees of success.\n\nThis year, the National Insurance hired a\nPopular Theatre Group to demonstrate the\nconcept of Social Security in Theatre Style.\nThis production “NIC Sa Zafe’ Nous” — “NIC is\nour business” has been presented to various\ncommunities and has attracted very favourable\ncomments and interest. It has proven to be a\nvery effective vehicle for taking the Social\nSecurity message to the self employed\nespecially in the rural communities.\n\nEmployers\n\nThe Organization realized that some\nemployers were unable to address queries\nfrom their employees on matters of National\nInsurance. These employers were also\nunaware of the various concepts underpinning\nthe philosophy of social insurance. To address\nthis, the organization has been holding a\nseries of workshops for employers targeting\nmanagers, payroll officers and personnel\nmanagers. Those who have attended the",

This exercise is\nongoing.\n\nTeachers\n\nA one-day seminar was conducted for teachers\nof social studies in secondary schools in St.\nLucia. The educators were given an overview\nof the operations of the National Insurance and\na general feel and appreciation for the whole\nconcept of social security. The objectives of\ntwo books on social security commissioned by\nthe NIC for Primary and Secondary Schools\nwere also explained to the participants in the\nhope that they would use these text books in\ntheir classroom and expose students to the\nconcept of social security.\n\nContributing to Public\nEnlightenment\n\nThis year, the organization embarked on a\ncollaborative effort with the University of the\nWest Indies, School of Continuing Education in\norganizing lectures on matters of national\nimportance.\n\nIn addition the organization initiated the series\nof panel discussions called “Zafe Nous” — “Our\nbusiness”. These panel discussions provide a\nplatform for discussion and input from the\npublic. The first was in July and the topic\n“Agriculture and Tourism — Friends or Foes”\nwas well presented by representatives from\nthe Ministry of Agriculture, the Banana Sector\nand the Tourism Sector. The discussion that\n\nensued was of a high standard. Suggestions\nfor addressing some of the problems affecting\nthe sectors were ventilated.\n\nWe were honoured by the attendance of the\nGovernor General to this first discussion.\n\nTraining\n\nAs a service organization, the National\nInsurance Corporation is aware of its\ncommitment to its customers and to the public,\nboth internal and _ external. To avoid\ncompromising the quality of service it delivers,\nthe Corporation has to ensure that staff at all\nlevels receive and remain exposed to relevant\ntraining, so that the viability of its operations is\nmaintained and at the same time enhancing\nit's image. The following are some of the\ntraining activities undertaken.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nThe training, undertaken throughout the year,\npermeated the organization. Five front line\nstaff attended a one-day workshop on\nCustomer Service and Public Demands,\norganized by the St. Lucia Employers’ Federation.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nThe Security Unit of the Corporation plays a\nmajor role in the safety of customers and\nproperty. The officers attended a presentation\nhosted by NIPRO on fire safety, precaution\nand evacuation techniques.

The programme focuses on\nlightening the financial burden of pensioners.\nConsequently it provides discounts and\nspecial benefits from participating businesses\nin the private sector. To date, a total of forty\nfour (44) businesses are in the programme\nproviding a wide range of services from\nbanking and commercial activities to health\nservices.\n\nThe focus now is to get more businesses\nespecially those in the out districts to\nparticipate in this venture.\n\nIt is gratifying to see the pride exhibited by\npersons accessing the programme.

Details of these projects follow:-\n\nConsultation on Older Persons and\nYouth at Risk\n\nOn January 26th 2005 the NCF met with\nindividuals representing local groups and\norganizations working with Youth at Risk and\nOlder Persons. Approximately forty six (46)\ngroups and organizations were represented of\nwhich 34 were from the Youth at Risk Sector.\n\nThe Consultation provided the NCF with the\nperfect forum to inform the participants about\nits functions and operations as well as its level\nof commitment to Youth at Risk and Older\nPersons.\n\n2005 Telethon\n\nThe NCF’s biggest fundraising event, the 2005\nNCF Telethon was held at the Pigeon Island\nNational Landmark on Sunday 3rd April. The\ntotal amount collected from the Telethon was\napproximately $112,000.00. Some individuals\nand companies pledged financial commitments\nfor periods from three years to an indefinite\nperiod.\n\nThe Virtues Project\n\nThe Brian Bernard Memorial Fund, a Donor\nAdvised Fund administered by the National\nCommunity Foundation, was established in\nmemory of the late Commissioner of Police.\n\nThe fund focuses on promoting and enhancing\nethical behaviour, human and spiritual values.\n\nThis it does by inspiring individuals and\ninstitutions to act ethically towards one\nanother through Education, Advocacy and\nResearch by way of the Virtues Project.\n\nThe NCF has embarked on a programme\naimed at training persons who are directly\ninvolved in educating youth in the Virtues\nprogramme. The programme is intended to\nprovide empowering strategies that inspire the\npractice of virtues in everyday life, including\nthe classroom. In light of this, the Foundation\norganized a five-day intensive training\nprogramme from July 11 — 15, 2005 for fifteen\nstaff members of the George Charles\nSecondary School which was facilitated by Ms\nLynda Brooke, a qualified facilitator from\nVirtues International.\n\nThe training of educators under the Virtues\nproject continues.\n\nWe salute the individuals and Corporations\nthat have joined hands with us in making the\nwork of the NCF a reality.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne can conclude that this year was an\nengaging one where much was achieved and\nmuch remains as work-in progress.\n\nAppreciation\n\n| close by expressing my heartfelt thanks to\nthe Minister for providing the environment\nwhere members were able to contribute in the\ninterest of the Corporation.

In these reviews\nan examination of the National Insurance\nFund’s (NIF) current and projected future\nfinancial status is made. The actuary is also\nexpected to recommend steps that may be\ntaken to help ensure that the scheme remains\nsolvent for future generations, while providing\nmeaningful benefits to current workers and\npensioners.\n\nDuring its first twenty-five years, the National\nInsurance Corporation (NIC) has experienced\nsteady growth in contribution and investment\nincome, benefit expenditure and reserves.\nHowever, over the past five years, the number\nof contributors has remained at around 40,000\nwhile the number of pensioners has increased\nby almost 40 per cent from 2,600 in 1999 to\n3,600 in 2003. At the end of the 2003 financial\nyear, National Insurance reserves stood at\nEC$737 million or 21 times total expenditure in\n2002-2003. Relative to the economy, total\nreserves were 39 per cent of GDP. While this\nis a relatively high level of funding, total assets\nare less than the present value of total benefits\nalready earned by past and _ present\ncontributors, a position consistent with the\ndesign and financing method adopted for most\nsocial security pension systems.\n\nDuring the past several years, several reforms\naimed at enhancing the financial sustainability\nof the NIF have been made. These changes\ncame out of recommendations made in the\nSixth Actuarial Review and included gradual\nincreases to the normal pension age and the\nqualifying number of contributions required for\na Retirement pension. While the Board and\nGovernment are to be complimented for the\nproactive measures aimed at strengthening St.\nLucia’s social security system financially,\nemphasis on securing long-term finances\nappears to have resulted in a _ potential\nreduction in benefits given that some pension\nqualifying conditions may be considered overly\nrestrictive.\n\nWith birth rates declining and increased\nlongevity among the elderly, future National\nInsurance finances will show a different\npattern from those of its first twenty-five years.\nWhile reserves are expected to continue\ngrowing for some time, the consequences of a\ndeclining contributor-pensioner ratio and a\ncontribution rate that is below the true cost of\nall benefits will gradually emerge as the\nscheme matures. Along with a review of the\nNIF’s financial position as of 30 June 2003,\nthis report includes projections of income,\nexpenditure and reserves through 2063. The\nfollowing charts illustrate the projected trend\nfor NIC reserves along with contribution and\nprojected expenditure rates assuming that the\ncontribution rate and benefit provisions remain\nunchanged.\n\nThe key results of the financial and\ndemographic projections based on the",
    "Page_23": "contribution and benefit provisions in place as\nof valuation date’ are:\n\n— The population will increase from 158,000\nin 2001 to just over 210,000 by 2063.\n\n— The ageing of the general population will\nhave a major impact on the ratio of\nworkers to retirees. For National\nInsurance, it is projected that the number\nof contributors for each pensioner will fall\nfrom 11.0 in 2003 to only 2.2 in 2063.\n\n— Contribution income is expected to be\nsufficient to meet total expenditure\nthrough 2023.\n\nActuary Report\n\nChart ES.2.

There\nare many economic and demographic factors\nthat will influence future income and\nexpenditure. So too will changes to rules\ngoverning contributions and benefits also\naffect actual finances. However, with Fund\ndepletion not expected for almost sixty years,\nvariances between assumptions and actual\nexperience that result in more or less\nfavourable estimates of when deficits will\nbegin and when the Fund will be depleted are\nnot likely to have a material difference on the\nconclusions and recommendations made in\nthis report.\n\nThe implications of a projected depletion of\nreserves and future contribution rates that\ncould possibly be in excess of 22 per cent\nshould not be ignored. But the primary\nchallenges facing the NIC at this time are the\nrelatively low coverage of the working\npopulation (due mainly to the exclusion of civil\nservants and low compliance rates among\nself-employed persons), stringent pension\nqualifying conditions that appear to be limiting\nthe number of persons being awarded\npensions and income replacement rates that\nmay be giving undue privilege to those just\nbarely meeting the minimum qualifying\n\nconditions. No recommendation is being made\nto adjust the contribution rate at this time.\nInstead, most of the recommendations made\nthroughout this report, and summarised below,\nfocus primarily on ensuring adequate\ncoverage, benefit adequacy and equity and\nmaintaining pension relevance.\n\nRecommendations\n\n(1) Wage ceiling increases should occur\nannually in line with changes in\naverage wages with the rules governing\nsuch increases placed in Regulations. To\nestimate changes in average national\nwages, a national wage index should be\ncreated by the government’s Statistics\nDepartment. Until such an index is\navailable, national insurance data may be\nused as a proxy. (Section 4.1)\n\n(2) An across-the-board increase to pensions-\nin-payment ranging from 2 per cent to 12\nper cent, depending on the year the\npension was awarded, should be granted.\nLump-sum grants, maternity and funeral\ngrants and the minimum pension rate\nshould also be increased. Thereafter,\npensions-in-payment and set benefit rates\nshould be automatically adjusted annually\nin line with average inflation over the\nprevious three years, with the rules that\ngovern the timing and the amount of each\nadjustment placed in Regulations.\n(Section 4.1)\n\n(3) Review the age at which a surviving\nspouse may receive a pension for more",
    "Page_25": "than one year. This age was recently\nincreased from 55 to pensionable age.\n(Section 4.3)\n\n(4) If the change that is presently being\n\nconsidered in the Retirement pension\nformula to one that uses earnings over\none’s career is not implemented, then\npension accrual rates should be revised so\nthat pensions accrue more gradually\ninstead of the current higher payment rate\n(40 per cent) for those who meet the\nminimum contribution requirement (now\n144 months). Also, consideration should\nbe given to reducing the number of months\nrequired to qualify for a pension to 120 but\nwith a 25 per cent or 30 per cent pension\nrate instead of 40 per cent. These latter\nchanges will result in fewer grants and\nmore pensions and thus enhanced\nsecurity among the elderly population.\n(Section 4.4)\n\n(5) Review the formula used to determine\n\nRetirement and Invalidity grants to\naccount for both employee and employer\ncontributions and accrued interest.\nPresently, only 50% of total NIC\ncontributions paid without interest is\nrefunded. Based on the contribution\nhistories of recent awards, a suitable\nformula could be devised. (Section 4.5)\n\n(6) Government should seek advice on ways of\n\nincorporating all civil servants into NIC\ncoverage, and of coordinating the payment\nof pensions of the two groups. While the\nrecent inclusion of persons who joined the\n\npublic service after January 2003 was a\npositive step, gaps in pension coverage\nstill exist as some public officers may not\nqualify for a pension when they leave the\nservice. (Section 4.6)\n\n(7) The Board should seek to significantly\n\nimprove the level of participation among\nthe self-employed by firstly making NIC\nself-employed coverage mandatory. In\naddition, efforts at increasing education on\nthe importance of compliance among this\ngroup, creating linkages with government\ndepartments that issue permits and/or\nlicenses to self-employed persons, and\ndeveloping a simplified approach to the\nway self-employed persons are required to\ncontribute should be considered. (Section\n4.7)\n\n(8) For investments, the Board should continue\n\nto gradually place additional funds outside\nof St. Lucia with a medium-term target of\nhaving 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the\nportfolio in regional and international\ninvestments. For local investments, a\nprudent asset mix, as provided for in the\nFund’s Investment Policy, should be\nmaintained. (Section 1.4)\n\nAmong regional social security systems,\nthe St. Lucia National Insurance Fund is\none of the best funded and best prepared\nto meet the increasing costs of an ageing\npopulation and maturing pension system.\nHowever, the proportion of the working\npopulation covered is lower than that of\nmost other systems and some pension\n\nSummary of\nActuary Report\n\nNATIONAL\n\nINSURANCE\nCORPORATIO",

In the coming years, therefore, in\naddition to increasing compliance among the\nself-employed, emphasis should be placed on\nachieving a suitable balance between strong\nfinances and equitable and relevant benefits.\nFor Retirement pensions, this could possibly\nbe achieved by providing for the payment of\nslightly less generous Retirement pensions to\nmore elderly insured persons.

INSURED POPULATION\n\nIn general, the future course of the National\nInsurance retirement pension program is\ndetermined to a large extent by the\ndemographic characteristics of its insured\npopulation and national long-term economic\n\nperformance. At any given point in time the\ninsured population would include active\ncontributors (paid employees, self-employed\nand voluntary contributors) and in-active\ncontributors (in-active insured persons).\n\nAs at June 2005, the insured population was\nestimated at 102,663 (53.77% were males and\n46.23% were females). During the period, July\n1979 — June 2004, the insured population\ninitially grew at the rate of 4% and gradually\nreduced to 2% at the end of the financial year\nin review. An age distribution of the insured\npopulation showed that 2% are under 20\nyears, 71% are approximately uniformly\ndistributed between the ages of 20 - 45 years\nand 27% are over 45 years. In addition, the\ninsured population is characterized by a mean\nage of 39.19 years.\n\n2.10 Active Insur\n\nThe active insured population comprises the\nfollowing categories of contributors:\n\na. New entrants (first-time contributors)\nand\n\nb. Insured persons who were employed\nand paid at least one-month\ncontribution in the review period.\n\nThe size and composition of active insured\npopulation are directly related to economic\nperformances. Positive economic growth is\nlikely to stimulate employment that may result\nin corresponding expansion of the active\ninsured population. Similarly, contraction in the\neconomy is likely to impact negatively on the",

The carrying\namount of the asset is reduced through the use of the provision for loan impairment.\nSubsequent recoveries are credited to the provision for loan impairment in the Statement of\n\nIncome and Expenditure.\n\nFor 2005, the impact is a net increase to income of $2,986,707.

The effective\ninterest rate method is the method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or\n\nliability and of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.\n\nWhen calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all\ncontractual terms of the financial instrument, but does not consider future credit losses.\n\nOnce a financial asset or group of financial assets has been written down as a result of an\nimpairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount\nthe future cash flows for the purpose of measuring impairment loss.\n\nDividend Income\n\nDividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recorded in the Statement of Income\nand Expenditure when the entities right to receive the payment is established.\n\nDevelopment Fees\n\nDevelopment fees are included in the project cost and are recognized as income over the\nlives of the projects on a pro rata basis.",

A provision for impairment of accounts receivable is\nestablished when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all\namounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.\nThe amount of the provisions is the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and\nthe present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.\nThe amount of the provision is recognised in the Income and Expenditure Statement.\n\n(m) Finance Lease\nThe asset held as a finance lease is recognised as a receivable and finance income is\nbased on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment\noutstanding in respect of the finance lease.\n\n(n) Financial Assets\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:\n\n0 Loans and Advances\n9 Held-to-Maturity Investments and\nQ Available-for-sale financial assets.\n\n \n\nreese\n\ncia ti\n\n \n\nNATIONAL ©\nINSURANCE\nCORPORATIO\n\nwith pride to build@o",

Were the Group to sell other than an\ninsignificant amount of the held to maturity assets, the entire category would be\ntainted and reclassified as available-for-sale.\n\nAvailable-for-Sale\n\nAvailable-for-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period\nof time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest\nrate, exchange rate or equity prices.\n\nPurchases and sales of financial assets held-to-maturity and available-for-sale are\nrecognised on trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the\nasset.\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction cost. Financial\nassets are derecognised when rights to receive cash flows from financial assets have\nexpired or when the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nAvailable-for-sale assets are subsequently carried at fair value.

These include the use of arm’s length transactions, discounted cash\nflows and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.\n\nImpairment of Financial Assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that\na financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of\nfinancial assets is impaired if there is objective evidence that the loss has occurred after\nthe initial recognition of the asset and has an impact on the ability of management to\nreliably estimate future cash flows of the financial asset or group of assets.\n\nThe Group assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets\nthat are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that\nare not significant.\n\nImpairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence that impairment loss on held-\nto-maturity investments carried at amortised cost has been incurred or that the Group will\nnot be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the\nloans. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the carrying\n\namount of the asset and the recoverable amount being the present value of the estimated\nfuture cash flows (excluding future credit losses which have not been incurred)\n\ndiscounted at the financial asset’s original effective rate.\n\nThe carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of the provision for loan\nimpairment. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the provision for loan impairment\nin the Statement of Income and Expenditure.\n\nThe methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed\nregularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss\nexperience.\n\nThe Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that\nfinancial assets carried at fair value is impaired.
