Therefore,\nphytochemicals with proven antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, such as carotenoids and\npolyphenols, could be of benefit in these diseases. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases for\noriginal studies investigating the benefits of different carotenoids and polyphenols in age-related\nophthalmic diseases. Our results showed that several polyphenols (such as anthocyanins, Ginkgo biloba,\n\nin, and resveratrol) and carotenoids (such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and mezoxanthin) have shown\nsignificant preventive and therapeutic benefits against the aforementioned conditions. The involved\nmechanisms in these findings include mitigating the production of reactive oxygen species, inhibiting the\ntumor necrosis factor-a and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways, suppressing p53-dependent\napoptosis, and suppressing the production of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin- (IL-) 8, IL-6, IL-\nla, and endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1. Consumption of products containing these\nphytochemicals may be protective against these diseases; however, adequate human data are lacking. This\nreview discusses the role and mechanisms of polyphenols and carotenoids and their possible synergistic\neffects on the prevention and treatment of age-related eye diseases that are induced or augmented by\noxidative stress and inflammation.",
