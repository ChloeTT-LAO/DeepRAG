A previous qualitative\nstudy found AF to substantially affect patients’ emotional wellbeing, social relationships,\nemployment, and finances. Existing quality of life questionnaires do not adequately assess\nthe AF impact. In this thesis, a new patient-reported questionnaire was developed to measure\nthe impact of AF as experienced by patients. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted\non the new questionnaire, revealing five domains: “Affect”, “Social Support’, “Major Life\nEvents”, “Financial Impact”, and “Diagnostic Experience”. Age, marital status, educational\nattainment, and time of last episode were significantly associated with the overall score.\nFemale gender was associated with a worse diagnostic experience after adjusting for\ncovariates, confirming previous qualitative findings. The new questionnaire has good internal\nconsistency and can be used to study variables associated with the AF impact.\n\nKeywords\n\nAtrial Fibrillation, Measurement, Patient-Reported Outcome Measure, Patient Journey,\nQuality of Life, Factor Analysis",
    "Page_3": "Summary for Lay Audience\n\nThe normal heart rate for adults at rest ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. A part from\nrate, the normal heart also follows a characteristic rhythm that can be detected on an\nelectrocardiogram. Departures from a regular rate or rhythm are referred to as arrhythmias.\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia where the heart beats too\nfast or too slow and out of rhythm. Patients with AF can often feel their hearts pounding or\nracing and experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty exercising,\ndizziness, and fatigue. AF can affect a patient’s wellbeing as soon as they begin to\nexperience symptoms. Previously, focus groups and interviews with patients revealed that\ngetting a diagnosis of AF was difficult because some physicians did not take patients’\nsymptoms seriously. It was also found that AF affected patients’ emotional wellbeing, social\n\nrelationships, employment, and personal finances.\n\nWe developed a questionnaire, called Mapping the Impact of Atrial Fibrillation (MAP-AF),\nand used it to study the life impacts of AF on patients. A statistical technique called factor\nanalysis allowed us to determine the different areas of peoples’ lives that AF impacts. By\nexamining these areas, or “domains”, we were able to see whether the MA P-AF measures\nwhat it was supposed to measure. We found five domains underlying 16 questions. They\nwere “Affect”, or mood, “Social Support”, “Major Life Events”, “Financial Impact”, and\n“Diagnostic Experience”. The MAP-AF allows us to calculate a total score and a score for\neach of the five domains for each person. We found patients who were younger, divorced or\nseparated, completed high school or below, or experienced a recent AF episode had higher\ntotal scores and were more impacted by AF. Confirming previous findings, our results\nshowed female patients to score higher (i.e., worse) on “Diagnostic Experience” than male\npatients. A fter our results are confirmed in a separate group of patients, the MAP-AF\nquestionnaire can be used to study how AF affects the wellbeing of patients, identify patient\nneeds, and improve healthcare services. Timely diagnosis and empathetic care are essential\nfor patient-centered A F management.\n\nili",

A trial\nfibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with\nsymptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, dizziness, and\nfatigue, The sometimes transient nature of AF episodes and symptoms can present\nchallenges to diagnosis.\n\nAF can affect a patient’s wellbeing in many ways. For instance, the uncertainty\nassociated with the onset of symptoms can create anxiety for many patients, which can be\nworse if physicians do not take patients’ concerns and symptoms seriously. After patients\nare treated, their symptoms may be alleviated, but they can also experience side effects\nand restrictions to their lifestyle. For example, patients taking blood thinners to prevent\nstrokes may avoid physical activities out of the fear of bleeding*>. Research is needed to\nunderstand how patients experience the effects of AF.\n\nThis thesis is the quantitative phase of the two-phase mixed methods exploratory\nsequential design, aimed at addressing the impact of AF on patients. Our research follows\nthe “instrument development model” of the exploratory design described by Creswell and\nPlano Clark (2007)®. In this model, qualitative data (e.g., quotes from interviews) are\ncollected first to explore a phenomenon. The qualitative information is then used to\ninform the development of a measure (e.g., a questionnaire), which will be used to collect\ndata for quantitative analysis. The qualitative and quantitative phases are connected\nthrough the development of questionnaire items®. This type of research design is\nparticularly helpful for understanding and measuring subjective and latent constructs like\nwellbeing and quality of life.\n\nThe qualitative phase involved two studies. The first was a Canada-wide project funded\nby the Cardiac Arrhythmia Network of Canada (CA Net). Led by Dr. Mary Runte, the\nproject utilized focus groups, narrative interviews, and patient journey mapping to solicit\n\nthe patient view of the arrhythmia impact. Patients in this study came from eight different",
    "Page_14": "Canadian cities and had various arrhythmic conditions, not limited to AF. The project\nspecifically looked at the economic, employment, social, emotional, and psychological\nimpact of arrhythmias from symptom-onset to treatment and beyond’. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first large scale project on the arrhythmia patient journey in Canada. The\nsecond study was a secondary analysis of the first study (Chang J et al., unpublished data,\nMay 2021). It analyzed only quotes and patient journey maps of AF patients and used the\nresults to inform concerns that are important to AF patients. The study then identified\nexisting patient-reported measures and compared the content of these measures to themes\nemerged from the quotes of AF patients. Existing quality of life questionnaires were\ndeemed inadequate for assessing the full impact of AF. The results of this (i.e., second)\nqualitative study will be used to develop items for a new questionnaire that will capture\n\nthe AF impact in a holistic manner.\n\nThis thesis will describe the development and initial validation of a new questionnaire,\nMapping the Impact of A trial Fibrillation (MAP-AF), in a sample of AF patients in\nLondon, Ontario. The initially validated MA P-AF questionnaire will then be used for\nscoring, and we will explore the relationship between the MAP-AF scores and selected\ncovariates (including demographic and clinical variables).\n\n1.1 Objectives\nThe objectives of this thesis are presented below.\n\nI. To generate items for a new questionnaire (MA P-AF) based on previous\nqualitative research\n\nII. To determine the factor structure of the MA P-AF questionnaire using\nexploratory factor analysis and to evaluate each factor’s internal consistency using\n\nCronbach’s alpha\n\nIII.

It includes a description of the qualitative\nstudy we previously conducted (Chang J et al., unpublished data, May 2021) that\ncompared existing quality of life questionnaires to findings from focus groups and\ninterviews with AF patients. The qualitative study highlights the limitations of existing\n\nquestionnaires and serves as the basis for our questionnaire development.\n\nBriefly, Chapter 3 will describe the development and validation of the MAP-AF\nquestionnaire, and Chapter 4 will describe the analyses of the questionnaire scores. Since\nthe methods of Chapter 4 depend entirely on the results of Chapter 3, both Chapters have\ntheir own methods and results sections.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we describe the methods and results of generating items for the new\nquestionnaire, factor analyzing the questionnaire, and removing items with suboptimal\n\nmeasurement properties.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we describe the methods and results of score computation, hypothesis\ntesting, statistical regression for model selection, and multivariable linear regression of\nthe overall (total) score on selected predictors.\n\nChapter 5 will discuss the results from both Chapters 3 and 4. We will also describe the\nimplications, strengths, and limitations of this thesis and make suggestions for future\nresearch.",

As estimated by the Global Burden of\nDisease project, 46.3 million individuals around the world were living with AF or atrial\nflutter in 2016°, Prevalence of AF is higher in developed countries, especially in Northern\nEurope and the United States (US), and lower in the Asia-Pacific area**.\n\nThe incidence and prevalence of AF are expected to rise globally as a result of population\naging, increasing prevalence of AF risk factors, and enhanced AF detection?*®, By 2030,\n14-17 million individuals in the European Union are expected to have AF’; by 2050, 6 —\n16 million individuals in the US alone are anticipated to have AF®,\n\nWhile the arrhythmia itself is not fatal, A F-related complications like heart failure (HF),\ntachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, and stroke put AF patients at an elevated risk of\ncardiovascular and all-cause mortality*®”. AF is associated with a 2- to 5-fold increase in\nthe risk of stroke *®®, and 20% — 30% of all ischemic strokes are attributable to AF?.\nAdditional morbidity includes cognitive impairment (e.g., vascular dementia) and\ncardiovascular morbidity (e.g., cardiomyopathy, left ventricular dysfunction) 2.\n\nFrom the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of A trial Fibrillation\n(ORBIT-AF) study, 31% of AF patients had one or more hospitalizations after a one-year\nfollow-up\". A nother population-based study in the US found that 1.5% of all\nhospitalizations listed AF as the primary cause, and 12% of all hospitalizations listed AF\nas a secondary cause or comorbidity’. The cost of emergency department visits and\nhospitalizations related to AF represents a significant burden on the healthcare system?.",
    "Page_18": "2.1.1. Diagnosis and classification\n\nAF rhythm is characterized by irregular RR intervals and the absence of distinct P waves\non the electrocardiogram®. In contrast, atrial flutter typically has atrial activity with a\n“saw tooth” morphology”. According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)\nguidelines, clinical AF is diagnosed when an electrocardiography (ECG) documented A F\nepisode lasts at least 30 seconds. The standard diagnostic procedure for patients reporting\nAF symptoms or patients who had a recent cryptogenic stroke involves a 12-lead ECG in\nthe clinic. If the 12-lead ECG does not indicate ongoing AF, a 24/48-hour Holter monitor\nor other prolonged ECG monitoring methods (e.g., 7- to 30-day event monitors) are\nattempted to document AF\".\n\nAF can be clinically classified into paroxysmal or persistent based on the duration and\nfrequency of arrhythmic episodes!?. According to the latest Canadian Cardiovascular\nSociety (CCS) guidelines for AF management, paroxysmal AF is defined as “a\ncontinuous AF episode lasting longer than 30 seconds but terminating within 7 days of\nonset” and persistent AF as “a continuous AF episode lasting longer than 7 days but less\nthan 1 year”!?, Paroxysmal AF that is short-lasting and intermittent may not be present\nduring 12-lead ECG or 24/48-hour Holter monitoring — in this case, repeated and\nprolonged monitoring may be necessary to diagnose AF\"!, Progression from paroxysmal\nto more persistent forms of AF is common when AF is left untreated’.\n\nBesides overt clinical AF, there is also silent atrial fibrillation (SAF), where patients are\nasymptomatic and unaware of their arrhythmia’. It is estimated that approximately one-\nthird of all AF is asymptomatic and subclinical**\"°. Despite the absence of symptoms,\nthe prognostic impact of SAF is considered to be the same as symptomatic clinical AF*\"4,\nTherefore, delays in diagnosis can allow the disease to progress to more severe forms and\nexacerbate the risk of stroke and other complications!*, Unfortunately, SAF often remains\nundetected until a patient experiences an adverse effect of AF and presents to the\nemergency department with a cryptogenic stroke or congestive heart failure**!5, SAF\nmay also be incidentally detected by implanted pacemakers or during routine\nphysicals**15,",
    "Page_19": "Recently, promising screening devices that are non-invasive (i.e., smartwatches) have\nbeen developed to enhance AF detection and expedite treatment initiation’.\n\n2.1.2 Symptoms\n\nSymptoms related to AF are highly variable between individuals and in the same\nindividuals over time!’. The most common symptoms, however, are palpitations, chest\npain, and exercise intolerance!’, Other symptoms reported by patients include dyspnea,\nsleeping difficulties, dizziness, psychosocial distress, and fatigue”'*. In some patients,\nsyncope and presyncope can be present!*. Not all symptoms reported are attributable to\nAF because risk factors and comorbidities of AF may also produce similar symptoms\"’.\n\nSymptom severity and burden can be assessed and classified by a number of instruments.\nThe CCS 2020 guidelines described four symptom severity scales!?:\n\nThe European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) Classification and the Canadian\nCardiovascular Society Severity of Atrial Fibrillation Scale (CCS — SAF) are two\nclinician-reported measures; the University of Toronto A trial Fibrillation Severity Scale\n(AFSS) and the A trial Fibrillation Symptom Severity and Burden (AFS/B) scale are two\n\npatient-reported measures!”\n\nAs mentioned earlier, asymptomatic AF is considered to have the same prognostic\nimpact as symptomatic AF*\"™. Even if successful treatment alleviates symptoms for\nsymptomatic patients, it may not eliminate AF or its associated stroke risk. Stroke\nprevention is continued in patients even after symptoms appear to be remedied. In\naddition, symptom alleviating treatment may not necessarily improve patients’ perceived\nwellbeing because of side effects, hospitalizations, and other factors. Two studies found\nthat symptom severity does not correlate well with global life satisfaction, and quality of\n\nlife may be reduced even in asymptomatic individuals®'®,\n\nGender and sex-based analyses in health can provide valuable insight into biological\ndifferences and potential health disparities. Using the EHRA symptom classification\nscale, one study found that female patients with AF reported more frequent and severe\nsymptoms compared to male patients!’. Regardless of gender, participants in the study",
    "Page_20": "most commonly experienced fatigue, dyspnea, and palpitations!”. Similarly, Westerman\nand Wenger (2019)'* reviewed four studies that all found women to be more\n\nsymptomatic!”19-21,\n\n2.1.3. Management\n\nCurrent management of AF consists of anticoagulation for stroke prevention, risk factor\nand comorbidity management, and rate and/or rhythm control®?4, Timely initiation of\nmanagement is critical to reduce symptoms and complications and slow the progression\nof AF‘,\n\nFollowing diagnosis, stroke and bleeding risk are assessed to guide decisions to\nanticoagulate. While the CHADS2 is the reference tool for stratifying stroke risk in\nclinical guidelines, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is more commonly used in clinical\npractice®*>6, The letters “CHADS” stands for congestive heart failure, hypertension,\nage > 75, diabetes, and stroke; and “VASc’” stands for vascular disease, age 65-74, and\nsex category female®*>°, The numeric “2” distinguishes factors with a much higher risk\nof stroke, for which 2 points (one additional point on the score) are warranted. A higher\nscore on both instruments indicates a greater need for anticoagulation.\n\nWarfarin and oral anticoagulants (OAC) effectively reduce the risk of stroke but can\nproduce side effects such as major bleeding®®. An individual with a high risk of bleeding,\nas assessed by scales like the HAS-BLED score, may be a candidate for percutaneous left\natrial appendage occlusion instead of OAC for stroke prevention®”’.\n\nWhile stroke prevention reduces stroke-related mortality, cardiovascular mortality due to\nother causes is still common in anticoagulated individuals”. Risk factors, underlying\n\ndisease, and comorbidity management are essential to reduce other causes of mortality.\n\nAlongside stroke prevention, ventricular rate control should be initiated for recent-onset\nAF patients. The most common pharmacologic rate control interventions are B-blockers\nand non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, both of which can slow the atrial\nfibrillation heart rate to a target range”,",
    "Page_21": "Acute rhythm control may be pursued as first-line therapy for severely compromised\npatients. Otherwise, it is indicated when ventricular rate control fails to adequately\nalleviate symptoms. For patients with persistent AF, sinus rhythm can be restored by\npharmacologic cardioversion (antiarrhythmic drugs) or direct current cardioversion along\n\nwith a rhythm medication to maintain sinus rhythm once it is restored.\n\nAmiodarone is both a rate and rhythm control drug®. While it is more efficacious than\nother antiarrhythmic drugs, it should be reserved for highly symptomatic patients because\nof its potential for long-term adverse side effects®’.\n\nFor patients who remain symptomatic despite rate and rhythm control medications,\ncatheter ablation targeting the pulmonary veins can be considered’. Pulmonary vein\nablation has been found to effectively restore sinus rhythm, improve quality of life, and\nreduce hospital admissions®.\n\nAtrio-ventricular nodal ablation with pacing is another type of ablation procedure. In\ncontrast to pulmonary vein ablation, which is a form of rhythm control, atrio-ventricular\nnodal ablation can deliver permanent rate control without the need for rate\nmedications®”®, It is an option for whom pharmacological rate control fails and rhythm\ncontrol strategies are deemed inappropriate (due to their inherent risks and timeline).\n\nAF management is complicated by concomitant conditions. The 2018 Focused Update of\nthe Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of A trial\nFibrillation highlighted seven advancements in AF management, including catheter\nablation for AF patients with HF and antithrombotic therapy for patients with coronary\nartery disease”,\n\nInterestingly, two review articles found sex differences in AF management!®”9, For\nexample, women were less likely to receive electrical cardioversion or ablation than\n\nmen!71829_\n\nOverall, patients with AF face unique challenges. Patients experiencing intermittent\nepisodes of AF may need to frequent medical centers and require prolonged monitoring\nfor a diagnosis. Furthermore, AF symptoms are highly variable. Even in the absence of",
    "Page_22": "10\n\nsymptoms, AF is associated with increased stroke risk and complications that will require\nongoing management. Patients navigating through the A F illness experience are faced\nwith much uncertainty. We will be able to better address patient needs and preferences\nwith a patient-centered care approach to AF management.\n\n2.2 Patient-centered care\n\nPatient-centered care was a new concept in medicine in the early 50s and had roots in\nCarl Rogers’ client-centered therapy. Client-centered therapy emerged from humanistic\npsychology in 1951 and revolutionized the therapist-and-client relationship. Clients are to\nbe treated as active participants in consultations, the therapist as an agent rather than an\nauthority*°. This approach encouraged clients to tell their own stories, believing that\nclients know themselves best. Medical psychoanalyst Michael Balint proposed a similar\n\nconcept in the medical field, coining the term “patient-centered medicine”?!4,\n\nThis new perspective and approach to medicine were, to a large degree, a response to the\nlimitations of traditional medicine*!*>. The traditional biomedical model was “illness-\ncentered”, interested primarily in localizing disease entities and resolving physiological\naberrations*\"*>, During this time, physicians practicing under this illness-centered lens\nhad difficulty helping patients who had complaints but for whom clinical investigations\nidentified no obvious physical cause*°. In response, Balint explained how the doctor’s\naffective response might play a role in alleviating or exacerbating the patient’s\nillness*!**5°, He further urged physicians to examine patients as whole persons when\nmaking a diagnosis or prescribing treatment 14,\n\nSince Balint’s pioneering work, there has been a growing interest and emphasis on\npatient-centered care. It is now widely acknowledged as a core value in medicine. In fact,\npatient-centered care is one of six establishing aims put forth by the Institute of Medicine\nin the US for the 21st-century healthcare system*”.\n\nWith the growing body of literature on the topic, various definitions of patient-centered\ncare have been proposed**3839, The general consensus is that “patient-centeredness”\n\nmeans moving away from physician-dominated “dialogue” to actively involving",
    "Page_23": "11\n\nparticipants in their own care (i.e., patient empowerment) and incorporating patient\nvalues and preferences into clinical decision making***”8, Akin to Roger’s client-\ncentered therapy, at the core of patient-centered care is the moral imperative of respecting\n\npatients as unique living beings****.\n\nWe describe two popularly cited frameworks that aim to clarify the concept of patient-\n\ncentered care.\n\nIn 1995, Stewart and colleagues from the Department of Family Medicine at Western\nUniversity (Ontario, Canada) developed a model to define the patient- doctor relationship\nand guide clinical practice. Stewart’s “patient-centered clinical method” was inspired by\nDr. Jan R McWhinney and Dr. Joseph Levenstein and initially had six components:\nexploring the disease and illness experience, understanding the whole person, finding\ncommon ground, incorporating prevention and health promotion, enhancing the patient-\nclinician relationship, and being realistic*. In 2014, the framework was revised to have\nfour components, dropping “incorporating prevention and health promotion” and “being\nrealistic”. The earliest version of the model remains one of the most cited in family\n\nmedicine*,\n\nMead and Bower (2000) reviewed the literature on existing patient-centered care models\n(including Stewart’s work) and synthesized aspects of the patient-doctor relationship\ncharacterized by patient-centeredness*°. Five key dimensions of patient-centeredness\nwere proposed by Mead and Bower, including the biopsychosocial perspective, patient-\nas-person, sharing power and responsibility, therapeutic alliance, and doctor-as-person.\n\nSeveral similarities can be found between the two conceptual frameworks described. We\nhighlight one similarity in particular — understanding the illness experience — in the\n\nfollowing section.\n2.3 Understanding the disease and illness experience — an\nessential component of patient-centered care\n\nUnderstanding the illness experience from the patient’s perspective is essential for\n\nachieving patient-centered care. In both the patient-centered clinical method developed",
    "Page_24": "12\n\nby Stewart and colleagues and the five dimensions of the patient-centered doctor-patient\nrelationship proposed by Mead and Bower, physicians are asked to enter the patient’s\n\nworld.\n\nOne component of the patient-centered clinical method developed by Stewart and\ncolleagues (2014) is exploring the patient’s disease and illness experience™, It requires\nphysicians to appreciate the patient’s feelings about being ill, their ideas about the illness,\ntheir expectations from healthcare providers, and how the illness is affecting their\nfunctioning.\n\nSimilarly, both the “biopsychosocial perspective” and “patient-as-person” dimensions of\npatient-centeredness proposed by Mead and Bower (2000) call for viewing patients as\n“experiencing individuals” rather than “objects of disease entities”*>, Mead and Bower\nprovided a powerful example to illustrate how one disease may affect two individuals in a\ncompletely different manner. While an office worker may be able to resume work\nfollowing a leg fracture, a professional athlete may be facing an end of their career with\nthe same injury. The distress experienced is different for the two individuals. In addition,\ntreatments do not always alleviate suffering for patients. The side effects and threats to a\npatient’s sense of self may be reasons why some patients decline life-saving cancer\ntreatments. It is imperative to examine the patient’s circumstances and attitudes when\n\ncaring for them, as they may help physicians identify the best courses of action®.\n\nUndoubtedly, patients are the ones with the most experience with the disease*°,\nUnderstanding the patient’s lived experiences with illness not only helps clinicians\nidentify patient needs and shortcomings of the healthcare system but is also a means of\n\nachieving patient-centered care.\n\n2.4 Collecting data on the patient perspective\n\nAttributes of patient-centered care are best evaluated using measures of the patient’s\nperception*’, To learn about the illness experience, we must refer to the experts on this\ntopic — the patients themselves. Interviews and self-administered questionnaires are\nmethods to collect information and expertise from patients.",
    "Page_25": "13\n\nThese questionnaires are generally referred to as “‘patient-reported measures” and can\nmeasure a variety of concepts. There are two main groups of these measures in the\nliterature: patient-reported outcome measures and patient-reported experience measures.\nThe former is primarily used to evaluate the effectiveness of care, and the latter to\nevaluate and improve healthcare services.\n\n2.4.1 — Effects of care and PROMs\n\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) assess the patients’ perceived effects of\ntheir care. The “effects” or “outcomes” measured can range from pain level, physical\nfunctioning, symptom severity, to quality of life (QoL)*\". Since we are interested in\nunderstanding how disease affects patients’ wellbeing, we will restrict our subsequent\ndiscussion of PROMs to QoL instruments.\n\nOne context of the use of PROMs is in clinical trials. For example, a QoL questionnaire\nis administered to patients before and after an intervention to assess QoL changes due to\ntreatment. The US Food and Drug Administration now recognizes QoL improvements,\nmeasured by validated instruments, as an indication or labelling claim on medical\nproducts‘?“3, It is currently the goal of many questionnaire developers to get their QoL\ninstruments approved for use in clinical trials. For this purpose, questionnaires need to be\nresponsive to interventions — that is, items in such questionnaires often measure aspects\n\nof QoL most responsive to health changes.\n\nQuality of life is a theoretical construct that cannot be directly observed or measured“. It\ncan be understood as “‘a multidimensional concept that ... often involves the concept of\nhappiness, subjective wellbeing, and the meaning given to life”**. Various interpretations\nof QoL exist, and no single definition is used consistently.\n\nThe World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) Group in 1995 defined QoL\nas:\n\n“individuals’ perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and\nvalue systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations,\nstandards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way",
    "Page_26": "14\n\nby the person’s physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social\n\nrelationships and their relationship to salient features of their environment”.\n\nThis definition recognizes the multidimensionality of QoL and the influence of cultural\nand person values on one’s perceived meaning of QoL“®’, Preliminary testing of the\ngroup’s global generic QoL questionnaire, WHOQOL, revealed four domains of QoL:\nphysical, psychological, social relationships, and environment*>. Themes considered\nunder “environment” include transport[ation], work satisfaction, home environment, and\n\nfinancial resources*®.\n\nAnother relevant concept is health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which is also what\nmany PROMs are said to measure. Unfortunately, various interpretations of HRQoL\nexist, leading to substantial confusion around the term***®, One definition of HRQoL is\naspects of self-perceived wellbeing that are affected by the presence of disease*’. In other\nwords, a measure of how patients are impacted by ill-health®°>!. However, this\ninterpretation of HRQoL brings about another discussion — that is, what aspects of QoL\nare not affected by health or ill-health, especially when indirect influences are considered.\nChronic illness affects almost all aspects of life. Guyatt et al. (1993) asserted that “when\na patient is ill or diseased, almost all aspects of life can become health related”*”,\nMoreover, different diseases have different mechanisms of affecting QoL“. Therefore,\nthe recommended practice is to develop unique HRQoL questionnaires for different\ndiseases to uncover aspects of wellbeing most impacted by the particular health problem.\n\nEvaluating the impacts of disease on a patient’s life is precisely the requisite for\n“exploring the disease and illness experience” — one component of Stewart’s patient-\n\ncentered clinical method**.\n\nAn evaluation of existing (HR)QoL questionnaires for AF found that most were adequate\nat assessing physical functioning, symptoms, and psychological impacts (Chang J et al.,\nunpublished data, May 2021). However, broader realms of wellbeing and life impacts\nlike social relationships, employment, and personal finances were overlooked. Most\nquestionnaires were developed for use in clinical trials instead of as a tool for routine use\n\nin the clinic.",
    "Page_27": "15\n\n2.4.2 Patient experience, PREMs, and patient journey mapping\n\nPatient-reported experience measures (PREMs) typically concern patients’ experiences\nwith practical aspects of healthcare services such as wait times and patient-provider\ncommunication*!°. They evaluate the patient’s experience or satisfaction with a\nparticular clinical encounter (e.g., surgery or consultation) to improve healthcare\ndelivery’. The majority of PREMs do not explore the patient’s lived experiences and are\nnot designed to understand how a chronic disease may affect multiple aspects of an\n\nindividual’s life over an extensive period of time.\n\nTo our knowledge, the only PREM for AF was adapted from the National Health Service\nAdult Inpatient Survey. It was used to assess patients’ experiences with the catheter\n\nablation procedures performed in England™.\n\nVisit-based PREMs fragment the patient experience. In reality, patients receive care from\ndifferent groups and move across healthcare providers and institutions. The result is\nhealthcare providers only seeing the component of care for which they are responsible,\nand no single provider oversees all the steps in a patient’s journey. True clinical process\nredesign and healthcare reform must recognize that “the patient is the only person who\n\nsees the whole journey”.\n\nAnother method to collect data directly from patients that overcomes the fragmentation of\nexperiences is process mapping of the patient journey.\n\nThe patient journey is a visual tool used to understand how the patient encounters and\ninteracts with a series of consecutive healthcare services or events. McCarthy et al.\n(2016) developed an integrated patient journey mapping tool that can be used to evaluate\n\nmanagement strategies for healthcare service reform™,\n\nEmployed for a slightly different purpose, Bolz-Johnson and colleagues (2020) used\npatient journey mapping as a way for patients to share their expertise and experience\nwhen studying a rare syndrome called “genturis syndromes”°, The genetic tumour risk\nsyndrome is difficult to diagnose and lacks effective preventative and therapeutic\ninterventions. Stages in their journey maps were based on inherent disease stages and the",
    "Page_28": "16\n\nclinical pathway. Their goal was to identify the needs common to the patients at each\nstage.\n\nSimilar to “genturis syndromes”, AF lacks effective preventative measures and can be\nhard to diagnose. As discussed previously, diagnosis of asymptomatic and paroxysmal\nAF is frequently delayed. Asymptomatic individuals may not present to the clinic until\ncomplications occur, and standard diagnostic procedures (12-lead ECG or 24/48-hour\nHolter monitoring) may not capture short-lasting and intermittent AF episodes right\naway!!1556, Tn addition, there is much variability in the presentation of symptoms. The\nmany uncertainties that AF patients and clinicians face, especially before a diagnosis is\nmade, render it a candidate disease for patient journey mapping.\n\n2.5 Atrial fibrillation patient journey\n\nUnderstanding the realities and circumstances of patients is crucial to patient-centered\ncare, will provide insight into the challenges from the patient’s perspective, and will\nallow clinical decisions to be made in a narrative that makes sense to patients°’. We\ndescribe a Canada-wide qualitative study on the arrhythmia patient journey conducted by\nDr. Mary Runte, a patient-partner researcher.\n\nThe project “Mapping of the Arrhythmia Patient Journey”, funded by the Cardiac\nArrhythmia Network of Canada*”, is Canada’s first in-depth, comprehensive, and patient-\nreported record of the experiences living with arrhythmia. This study consisted of\nindividual interviews, focus groups, and patient journey mapping that solicited the patient\nview of the economic, employment, social, emotional, and psychological impacts of\narrhythmias*’. The study involved patients with various arrhythmia conditions not limited\nto AF. Patients with confirmed cardiac arrhythmias were asked to create a map of their\njourney and describe the effects of their arrhythmia from the onset of symptoms to\ntreatment and beyond. Trend lines were created to capture the changes in emotions, social\n\nrelationships, employment, and finances over the course of their joumeys.",
    "Page_29": "17\n\nTen focus groups (91 participants) and 62 individual in-depth interviews were conducted\nin eight Canadian cities since August 2018. The focus groups had participants from all\n\nprovinces except for Manitoba®’.\n\n2.6 Mapping questionnaire items to the patient journey\n\nUsing the data collected from “Mapping of the Arrhythmia Patient Journey”, we\nconducted secondary research to evaluate whether existing PROMs, specifically\n(HR)QoL questionnaires for AF patients, capture important themes that emerged from the\nfocus groups and journey maps (Chang J et al., unpublished data, May 2021).\n\nWe searched for (HR)QoL questionnaires because they approximately measure patient-\nperceived wellbeing impacted by AF. PROMs that assess symptom severity were not of\ninterest, and there was only one PREM specific to AF that concems the ablation\nexperience. We analyzed only the transcripts and journey maps of AF patients to identify\nrelevant concerns under each of the four themes (“Emotional”, “Social”,\n“Employment/Schooling”, and “Financial’”). The results of thematic analysis are\n\nsummarized below:\n\nIt was an emotional experience for patients, particularly women, to try to get a diagnosis\nfor AF. Female patients reported feeling dismissed and not taken seriously when\ncommunicating their symptoms to physicians. When a diagnosis was finally confirmed,\nfemale patients expressed feeling validated. The unpredictability of episodes and\nsymptoms left patients, regardless of gender, to experience negative emotions. These\nincluded feelings of worry, anxiety, loneliness, sadness, and fear. Women’s emotional\n\nexperiences tended to be more negative than men’s.\n\nSocial support changed over the course of the patient’s journey. At the beginning of their\nAF journey, patients typically isolated themselves from family and friends due to feelings\nof embarrassment and feeling like a burden to others. Family and friends were most\nsupportive at this time.",
    "Page_30": "18\n\nAs patients became more comfortable with their condition following treatment, patients\nbegan to open up and seek social engagement. However, friends and family had pulled\nback as a result of caregiver fatigue.\n\nAF also affected patients’ personal finances. For example, patients missed work and lost\npotential income when they felt ill or had to attend a medical appointment. The latter was\nespecially a burden for patients who live in rural areas and need to frequent medical\ncenters. Patients with more severe disease may need to change careers or retire early,\n\nsignificantly impacting their source of income.\n\nFor patients who continued to work, work performance and relationships with colleagues\ncan be affected by patients’ conditions. The impact of AF on patient’s employment and\n\nschooling was worse if institutions were not supportive or accommodating.\n\nWe mapped the items of four HR(QoL) questionnaires developed for AF patients onto\nthe themes and subthemes presented above. This provided insight into whether existing\nquestionnaires were adequate or if a new questionnaire was warranted to measure the AF\nimpact in the Canadian population. We determined the latter be true. Our analysis of\nexisting (HR)QoL questionnaires found that most were heavily focused on symptoms and\nphysical functioning, including the ability to perform daily activities. Two questionnaires,\nthe A trial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) and the A trial Fibrillation\nQuality of Life (AFQoL), addressed the impact of AF on patient’s emotional wellbeing\nand social life. However, not all emotional- and social-related concerns found in the\nfocus groups and journey maps were addressed. None of the four questionnaires\nmeasured AF’s impact on patients’ occupation, livelihood, and finances (Chang J et al.,\nunpublished data, May 2021).\n\nA new questionnaire that comprehensively measures the life impacts of AF along the\npatient journey may be beneficial for research, holistic assessments in the clinic, and for\n\nevaluating patient progress and healthcare delivery.\n\nThe above-mentioned study was conducted as part of the qualitative phase of the mixed\nmethods exploratory design for questionnaire development (Chang J et al., unpublished",
    "Page_31": "19\n\ndata, May 2021). The quantitative phase, which concers the development and initial\nvalidation of a new questionnaire, is based upon the qualitative and will be described in\nChapter 3.\n\n2.7 Conclusion\n\nNo PROM adequately captures the impact of AF on patients throughout the patient\njourney from symptom onset to post-treatment. We propose developing a new\nquestionnaire that will comprehensively measure the AF impact, with an emphasis on the\ndiagnostic experience, available social support, employment, and finances.\n\nIn this thesis, we describe the development and initial validation of the new questionnaire\n(MAP-AF) as well as the analyses of the questionnaire scores. This thesis is a\nquantitative investigation of the AF impact connected to earlier qualitative research\nthrough questionnaire development. The mixed methods exploratory design will allow us\nto gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact AF has on patients.",

    "Page_37": "25\n\nChapter 3\n3 Development of the MAP-AF questionnaire\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, several insights emerged from analyzing the transcripts of\nabout 101 patients with atrial fibrillation who participated in the project “Mapping the\nArrhythmia Patient Journey” (Chang J et al., unpublished data, May 2021). AF was found\nto impact the patients’ psychological well-being, social relationships, occupation, and\npersonal finances. Moreover, it was more difficult for female patients to get a diagnosis\nfor AF than males —- women more frequently expressed feeling dismissed when\n\ncommunicating their symptoms to physicians.\n\nExisting patient-reported outcome measures do not adequately measure these concerns\nbrought forth by AF patients in the focus groups and interviews (Chang J et al.,\nunpublished data, May 2021). Our goal was to develop a patient-reported questionnaire\nthat would capture these important missing concerns and apply this questionnaire to\nconfirm the qualitative findings and test hypotheses.\n\nChapter 3 summarizes the development of the Mapping the Impact of A trial Fibrillation\n(MAP-AF) questionnaire. The chapter encompasses both the methods and the results of\nitem generation, exploratory factor analysis, and item reduction. The final MAP-AF\nquestionnaire described in this chapter was then used to develop hypotheses and plan the\nanalyses described in Chapter 4.\n\n3.1 Methods\n3.1.1 Item generation and questionnaire design\nThe Mapping the Impact of A trial Fibrillation (MA P-AF) was developed to measure the\n\nmulti-faceted life impacts of AF as experienced by Canadian patients.\n\nThirty-five items were written to reflect the themes and concerns emerged from the\ntranscripts of AF patients (see section 2.6 fora summary of the themes and concerns).\nFor example, there were items about the emotional struggles of getting a diagnosis, the",
    "Page_38": "26\n\neffects of AF on social relationships, employment, and personal finances. Furthermore,\nsome items were tied to a specific phase in the patient journey timeline: symptom-\nonset/pre- diagnosis phase, peri-diagnosis phase, or post-diagnosis phase. Other items\nasked about general concerns and current wellbeing. The print version of the preliminary\n35-item MA P-AF is available in Appendix A.\n\nThe relevance and wording of the items were discussed with a patient- partner researcher,\nand the final candidate items were reviewed by the committee members — including a\nmethodologist and a clinician.\n\nAll items utilized a 7-point Likert response scale. For items 16 to 21, the response options\nranged from “not at all bothered” to “extremely bothered”; for the remaining items, the\nresponse options ranged from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. Except for the\nreverse coded items, a higher position on the scale reflects a greater experienced impact\n\nor a more negative patient experience.\n\nDue to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the preliminary 35-item\nMAP-AF was administered via an online survey platform — Qualtrics. The Software-as-a-\nService platform uses Transport Layer Security encryption for all transmitted Internet\ndata!. The study was approved by the Westem University Health Sciences Research\nEthics Board (HSREB) and Lawson Research. The initial approval letters and the most\nrecent approval letter for amendments are available in Appendix B.\n\nUsing Qualtrics, we incorporated skip patterns into the questionnaire such that the\noccupation-related questions (items 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, and 18) were displayed only\nfor participants who were currently working or worked while experiencing AF. In\naddition, a non-applicable (N/A) option was available for items 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 33,\n34, and 35.\n\nOn Qualtrics, a textbox was available for respondents to comment on additional concerns,\nthe questionnaire design, or the questionnaire-taking experience. The comments from\nrespondents were used to inform some of the strengths and limitations of our study,\n\nwhich are discussed in Chapter 5.",

Incidentally\ndiagnosed individuals would not be suited to answer items 1 to 5. A general treated\npopulation of AF patients would be able to look back on their experiences from\nsymptom-onset to post-treatment and provide an overview of the AF patient journey.\n\nPulmonary vein ablation (PVA) is the comerstone for most AF ablation procedures and is\noften pursued for patients who remain symptomatic after rate or rhythm medications’. By\nrecruiting PVA patients, we could better exclude asymptomatic patients, who are more\nlikely to be incidentally diagnosed.\n\nPatients who were not fluent in English or not familiar with the technological\nrequirements of the study were still eligible if they could receive assistance from another\nindividual such as a family member.\n\nFor exploratory factor analysis, a minimum of 10 cases per item and an absolute\nminimum of 300 cases are recommended**. For our 35-item MAP-AF, a sample size of\n350 would meet both recommendations. From the clinical database at the LHSC, we used\nnon-probability sampling and identified 500 consecutive post-PVA patients eligible for\nour study.\n\nA member within the patient’s circle of care mailed out invitation letters introducing the\nstudy and informing potential participants to expect a call from the research student.\nPatients were told in the letter that they had no obligation to take the call.

Data collection and management\n\nThe email addresses provided by interested participants were uploaded onto Qualtrics,\nand personalized links were emailed to participants through Qualtric’s internal mailing\n\nsystem.\n\nOnce the link was accessed, participants were presented with the letter of information, the\n35-item MAP-AF, and a separate list of questions that collected demographic and clinical\ninformation. Participants received a reminder email two weeks before the March 7th\n\ndeadline.\nImplied consent was obtained from participants who submitted the online questionnaire.\n\nThe first and last names, phone numbers, and email addresses of consenting participants\nwere collected and stored in the master list, separate from the de-identified questionnaire\nresponses. The master list and de-identified data are linkable by a unique study ID. Both\nfiles are password protected, encrypted, and stored on Western’s OneDrive (an\ninstitutionally sanctioned cloud), with access restricted to the research team.

Currently working\nII. Not currently working, but previously worked while experiencing AF\nIII.

All other demographic and clinical variables were\n\ncategorical and were summarized using frequencies and percentages.\n\nThe literature review found gender differences in AF — women were more symptomatic\nthan men, but less likely to receive an ablation®’, We used bivariate analyses to compare\nthe demographic and clinical characteristics of our male and female patients. Student’s\nindependent t-test was used to determine whether age differed significantly between the\ntwo genders; Fisher’s exact test was used to determine whether there was an association\nbetween the other categorical variables and gender. We excluded missing values in both\nunivariate and bivariate analyses.\n\nThe 35 item variables were assumed to be continuous from using a 7-point Likert\nresponse scale. We described for each item the number of participants who skipped,\nselected N/A, or did not provide a response. We also explored the missing patterns of the\nitems. Summary statistics were then provided for the complete cases.\n\n3.1.6 Statistical analyses\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (Copyright ©\n2016 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)?.\n\n3.1.6.1 Exploratory factor analysis\n\nFactor analysis is a statistical technique used to explain a large set of observed variables\n(e.g., items) using a smaller number of latent variables called factors®!°. Exploratory\nfactor analysis (EFA) allows items to freely load on factors. It is appropriate for\ndetermining the underlying dimensions of newly developed questionnaires. Once strong\nhypotheses about the factor structure exist, confirmatory factor analysis can be used to\ntest if the items load on hypothesized factors in a new sample’.We first investigated the\nfactorability of our data matrix by running a principal components analysis. We\nexamined the correlation matrix, partial correlation matrix, and Kaiser’s Measure of\n\nSampling Adequacy (MSA) for evidence of factors underlying the items. We then ran a",
    "Page_44": "32\n\npreliminary factor analysis to check if the squared multiple correlations (SMCs) were\ndistant from 1, indicating an absence of singularity and multicollinearity''.\n\nWe determined the number of factors to extract using four criteria. In addition to\nconventional criteria such as the eigenvalue-greater-than-1 rule (also known as Kaiser’s\ncriterion) and the scree plot, we performed parallel analysis and examined the minimum\naverage partial, both considered more accurate than the former methods\". Sensitivity\nanalyses were conducted to assess whether the suggested number of factors to extract\ndiffered when log transformations of skewed items were performed or when using an\nimputed dataset (using an expectation maximization algorithm to compute the maximum\nlikelihood estimates for missing data)!%.\n\nAfter several possible numbers of factors were identified, a series of factor analyses were\ncarried out using unweighted least squares extraction and promax rotation. Unweighted\nleast squares (ULS) is an extraction method robust to non-normal distributions, and\npromax rotation is a type of oblique rotation which assumes some correlation between the\nfactors!*'415, In contrast, orthogonal rotation methods assume factors are uncorrelated.\n\nA series of sensitivity analyses was conducted to ensure the robustness of the final factor\nstructure to missing values, skewed items, and various extraction and rotation methods.\n\n3.1.6.2 Item reduction and internal consistency\n\nAn item was said to load on a factor if the rotated factor loading from the pattern matrix\nwas greater or equal to 0.35. Once the items were grouped into factors, the internal\nconsistency of each factor was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Irrelevant items were\nidentified as those with a low item-to-total correlation and high alpha-if-deleted values.\nRedundant items were removed one at a time, with Cronbach's alpha recalculated upon\neach deletion. Item reduction ceased when any further deletions would greatly decrease\nthe overall internal consistency of a factor. An EFA was repeated without the deleted\nitems to confirm the factor structure.",

A participant flowchart is included in Figure 2.\n\nThe mean (SD) age of participants was 63.8 (8.9) years. Age ranged from 26 years to 93\nyears. Since the distribution of age was slightly skewed as a result of a few younger\nindividuals, we also report the median and interquartile range of age. The median age for\nmale patients (n=193) was 64 years with an interquartile range of 59 to 70 years; the\nmedian age for female patients (n=84) was 66 years with an interquartile range of 61 to\n70 years.\n\nTable 2 presents the demographic characteristics of male and female participants, and\nTable 3 presents the clinical characteristics.

Only two\nindividuals were diagnosed under a year ago. Slightly over half of the total sample did\nnot know whether they had paroxysmal or persistent AF. Of patients who knew, 83 had\nparoxysmal AF and 40 had persistent A F. Patients in our study have had a pulmonary\nvein ablation procedure, and most perceived themselves to be at the “treatment and\nbeyond” phase on a patient journey timeline (Figure 3). Many patients no longer\nexperienced AF following successful ablations — the current AF burden in our sample\nwas suspected to be moderate to low. In support of this, 41% last experienced an episode\nof AF (irregular heart rhythm) more than a year ago, and 42% indicated minimal to no\nrecent symptoms (Table 3). Despite the reported percentages, we anticipate substantial\nmeasurement error in three clinical variables. Questions asking about the frequency of\nAF episodes, the time of last episode, and symptom severity were confusing to patients\nwho no longer experienced AF. Instead of reflecting on their current AF burden, some of\nthe patients responded in a way that reflected their past AF burden when they still had\nAF.

Item characteristics\n\nThe number of respondents who answered, skipped, missed, or selected the N/A option\nfor each item is summarized in Table 4. Fifty-seven respondents automatically skipped\nthe eight work-related items (items 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, and 18) because they never\nworked or never worked while experiencing AF. Alternatively stated, the work-related\nitems did not apply to 21% of the sample. Whenever a N/A option was available (i.e.,\nitems 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 33, 34, and 35), it was always selected by at least some\nindividuals.\n\nBoth the skip pattern and the incorporation of a N/A option were features of the\nquestionnaire designed to reflect the non-applicability of certain items. The eleven items\n(marked by an asterisk in Table 4) that were considered non-applicable to greater than\n10% of the total sample were removed from subsequent analyses. The remaining 24 items\nproceeded to factor analysis.\n\nOur data had few missing values, ranging from none to a maximum of 6 missing values\nfor item 12. A greater number of missing values were found for items without a N/A\noption, suggesting that respondents may have missed an item because the statement was\nnot applicable, rather than simply missing by accident. Indeed, participants who had\nmissing values often selected the N/A option when possible and appropriate. We propose\nthat missing values could be attributed to suboptimal question wording, the nearby\npresence of family members, forgetfulness, or the lack of a N/A option when the question\ndid not apply. We believe the last to be a probable explanation based on comments\nprovided by several patients. We discuss this in greater detail in Chapter 5.",

    "Page_64": "52\n\nChapter 4\n4 Analyses of the MAP-AF scores\n\nThis chapter describes both the methods and results of the MAP-AF score analyses.\nComputation of the factor scores and the overall score, including the handling of missing\ndata, is described. A priori hypotheses related to the factor scores are tested, and a\nmultivariable linear regression is run on the overall score to identify significant\npredictors.\n\n4.1 Methods\n\n4.1.1 Factor scores\n\nThe MAP-AF has five factors underlying 16 items: “Affect” and “Social Support” each\nhas four items, “Financial Impact” and “Major Life Events” each has three items, and\n“Diagnostic Experience” has two. The complete factor structure, including the specific\n\nitems, can be found in Table 9 of Chapter 3.\n\nThe N/A options available for items 19, 33, and 34 from “Financial Impact” and item 21\nfrom “Major Life Events” complicate factor score computation, along with missing\n\nvalues.\n\nWe first referred to the item-total correlations of the four items presented in Table 9 of\nChapter 3. A low standardized item-total correlation and a high standardized alpha-if-\ndeleted value signal an item that is less essential or potentially irrelevant for the particular\nfactor. When examining “Financial Impact”, item 19 had the lowest item-total\ncorrelation, and when deleted, may increase the overall Cronbach’s alpha from 0.81 to\n0.89. On the other hand, deleting either items 33 or 34 will reduce the overall Cronbach’s\nalpha significantly to the 0.6 range. Therefore, individuals selecting N/A or missing item\n19 could still have a meaningful “Financial Impact” score computed. For “Major Life\nEvents”, item 21 (with the N/A option) had the highest item-total correlation and, if\ndeleted, would reduce the overall Cronbach’s alpha from 0.68 to 0.54. Item 21 was",
    "Page_65": "53\n\ndeemed essential to the factor — individuals selecting N/A or missing item 21 could not\n\nhave a meaningful “Major Life Events” score.\n\nThe computation criteria for the factor scores are summarized in Table 11 in the results\nsection. For the two 3-item factors, only 1 item was allowed to be missing or N/A: item\n19 for “Financial Impact” and items other than item 21 for “Major Life Events”. Since\n“Diagnostic Experience” only had two items, both items must be non-missing for the\nfactor score to be computed. For “Affect” and “Social Support”, at least two items needed\n\nto be non-missing for computation (50% of items should be non-missing).\n\nIf factor scores were computable, they were calculated as an arithmetic mean of the non-\nmissing (and applicable) items. For “Social Support”, items 22 and 23 were reverse\ncoded. The mean factor scores range from 1 to 7, where a higher score reflects a more\nsignificant impact experienced by patients.\n\nAn overall MAP-AF score was also computed as an arithmetic mean of the 16 items — if\nall factor scores were computable. The mean overall score was then rescaled to range\nfrom 0 to 100, where a higher score similarly indicates a worse patient experience ora\ngreater experienced impact of AF.\n\n4.1.2 Descriptive analysis\n\nFactor scores were summarized statistically using mean + SD and graphically using\nhistograms, boxplots, and normal quantile- quantile (Q-Q) plots.\n\nBivariate analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between the overall score\nand the demographic and clinical covariates. The linear and monotonic relationships\nbetween age and the overall score were examined using the Pearson product-moment\ncorrelation and the Spearman rank- order correlation, respectively. The non-parametric\nWilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann-Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon-\nMann-Whitney test) was used to assess gender differences in the overall score. The non-\nparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for all other categorical covariates with more\nthan two levels.",
    "Page_66": "54\n\nNon-parametric tests were selected over parametric tests because some subgroup scores\nwere heavily skewed. This means that if the scores were normally distributed, the\n\ninferential statistics presented are more conservative.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (Copyright ©\n2016 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)!.\n\n4.1.3. Hypothesis testing\n\nWe generated seven a priori hypotheses for the five factors based on pre-existing\nknowledge and results from our previous qualitative work (Chang J et al., unpublished\ndata, May 2021).\n\nTo recap our previous findings, women and patients with intermittent AF episodes had a\nmore difficult time trying to get a diagnosis. Patients residing in rural areas incurred\nhigher transportation costs and lost potential income when they had to miss work and\ntravel for clinical appointments. We also discovered a pattern in social support. Family\nand friends were the most supportive proximally before and after patients were\ndiagnosed. During this time, many patients withdrew socially from family and friends\ndue to feelings of embarrassment and guilt. As patients felt more comfortable with their\ncondition over time, they began to seek social engagement. However, friends and\nfamilies had started to decrease their support as a result of caregiver fatigue.\n\nBased on these findings, we hypothesized the following:\n\nI) & II) Female patients and paroxysmal patients will score higher (i.e., worse) on\n“Diagnostic Experience” compared to male patients and persistent AF patients,\n\nrespectively\n\nII) Patients residing in rural areas will score higher on “Financial Impact”\n\ncompared to patients residing in urban areas\n\nIV) Patients who were diagnosed more distantly in the past will score higher (i.e.,\n\nworse) on “Social Support” than patients recently diagnosed",
    "Page_67": "55\n\nThree additional hypotheses were generated based on what is known in the literature:\n\nV) Women tend to have larger support networks than men’. We hypothesize\nfemale patients to score lower (i.e., better) on “Social Support” compared to male\npatients\n\nVI) Women tend to be more emotionally expressive than men? and generally\nexperience greater anxiety and depression*°. We hypothesize our female patients\n\nto score higher on “Affect” compared to male patients\n\nVII) Patients with paroxysmal AF are more likely to experience palpitations than\npatients with persistent A F°, Paroxysmal patients may experience greater anxiety\ndue to the on and off palpitations. We hypothesize patients with paroxysmal AF to\nscore higher on “Affect” than patients with persistent AF\n\nHypotheses related to gender differences were tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test was used for all other hypotheses which have categorical\ncovariates with more than two levels. If the overall Kruskal-Wallis test was statistically\nsignificant (p-value < 0.05), pairwise comparisons were made using the Dwass, Steel,\nCritchlow-Fligner (DSCF) method. The DSCF statistics and the associated two-sided p-\nvalue are computed based on pairwise two-sample Wilcoxon comparisons’.\n\n4.1.4 Using statistical regression to select predictors\n\nBy the end of Chapter 3, the MAP-AF was validated in one sample of PVA patients.\nInferential analyses will remain exploratory until the MAP-AF can establish its validity\nacross multiple samples.\n\nFor this reason, it was acceptable at our stage to select predictors based on statistical\ngrounds.\n\nThere are three main methods for predictor selection in statistical regression: backward\nselection, forward selection, and stepwise selection.",
    "Page_68": "56\n\nBackward selection begins with a full model and deletes variables with the least\nsignificant F statistic one at a time until all variables in the model have F statistics at a\nspecified stay significance level®, Vittinghoff and colleagues (2012) suggest a liberal\ncriterion for deletion, removing only variables with p-values greater or equal to 0.2°.\nEach deletion (or addition, in forward selection) produces a new model, resulting in a\nsequence of models once variable movement halts. Either the last model in the sequence\nor the model with the best fit statistics is usually selected. The R-square statistic is one of\nthe most common model fit statistics. An alternative tool for optimal model selection is\nAkaike’s information criterion (AIC). The AIC measures the difference between a given\nmodel and the “true” underlying model and is a function of sample size, sum of squared\nerrors, and the number of parameters!°. It was shown to be superior for selecting the most\n\noptimal model in statistical regression\"®.\n\nA major limitation of both forward and stepwise selection methods is that they begin with\na null model. The full model (with all predictors) may never emerge unless all candidate\npredictors are deemed significant. To that end, Vittinghoff et al. (2012) recommend using\nbackward selection primarily and the other two methods for sensitivity analyses®.\n\nTo select demographic and clinical covariates for the overall MA P-AF score, we used\nbackward selection with a significance level for retaining predictors set at 0.20. Of all the\nmodels produced from the sequential deletion of variables, the model with the smallest\nAIC was selected.\n\nSensitivity analyses were carried out to compare results obtained from backward\nselection (stay significance level = 0.20), forward selection (entry significance level =\n0.50), and stepwise selection (entry significance level = 0.20 and stay significance level =\n0.20).\n\nMissing values were excluded by list-wise deletion.\n\n4.1.5 Multivariable linear regression\n\nBased on the results of statistical regression, the final linear regression model for the\noverall score included age (and age-squared), gender, marital status, educational",
    "Page_69": "57\n\nattainment, and time of last AF episode. Parameter estimates of the linear regression were\nobtained using the generalized linear model (GLM) procedure in SAS software since the\nregression (REG) procedure does not directly handle categorical predictors!!.\n\nAge was centered to make the intercept more interpretable, and a quadratic term for age\nwas added to improve the linearity of the continuous predictor with the overall score.\n\n4.1.6 Model fit and diagnostics\n\nTo check model assumptions, we examined the normality of the residuals,\nhomoscedasticity, and the linearity of age (the only continuous predictor). The adjusted\ncoefficient of determination (adjusted R2) reflected the model fit, and the Difference in\nFits (DFFITS) was used to detect influential observations. The DFFITS statistic for an\nobservation quantifies the change in predicted values when that observation is deleted!*.\nWe explored the robustness of the parameter estimates to potentially influential\nobservations by deleting observations with the largest DFFITS five at a time.\n\n4.1.7. Additional models\n\nUsing the same five predictors included in the main linear regression model, we ran five\n\nadditional models for the five factor scores.\nThe factor scores were rescaled to range from 0 to 100 for better interpretability.\n\nSignificant findings are briefly summarized in the results section.\n\n4.2 Results\n\n4.2.1 Descriptive analysis\n\nThe number of observations, mean, and standard deviation of each factor score are\nsummarized in Table 11. Thirteen individuals selected “N/A” for item 21, and hence, the\nmean score for “Major Life Events” was not computable for these individuals. Likewise,\n\n26 individuals selected “N/A” for either item 33 or 34, reducing the number of “Financial\n\n \n\nImpact” scores to 250. “Financial Impact” had the lowest mean score (2.6 + 1.5), and\n\n \n\n“Major Life Events” had the highest mean score (4.1 + 1.5). The factors “Affect” and",
    "Page_70": "58\n\n“Major Life Events” were approximately normally distributed, whereas the other three\nwere quite skewed. Only 244 individuals had a mean score for all five factors; thus, the\noverall MAP-AF score was computable for 244 individuals. The overall score on a scale\nof 0 to 100 had a mean of 37.8 (SD: 17.8) and ranged from 2.1 to 89.6. The distribution\nwas positively skewed with a short tail on the left and a long tail on the right (skewness:\n0.54, kurtosis: -0.11).\n\nTable 11.

    "Page_76": "64\n\n4.2.3 Statistical regression\n\nThere were seven demographic covariates and five clinical covariates in our dataset.\n\nBefore specifying all covariates into backward statistical regression, we carefully\nexamined three clinical covariates: frequency of AF episode, time of last AF episode, and\nrecent symptom severity. These variables were designed to reflect participants’ current\nAF burden. However, they were problematic for patients who no longer experience AF\nfollowing successful PVA. A few of those patients asked for clarification because they\nwere unsure whether to approach the questions as they would in the past when they still\nhad AF or as of now. We suspect that many patients in a similar situation may have\nresponded in a way that reflected past AF burden. When we examined the responses\nparticipants provided, we discovered many incongruent answers that were variants of the\n\nfollowing:\n\nFrequency of AF episode(s) was “every day”; time of last AF episode was “more\n\nthan 1 year ago”; recent severity of symptoms was “severe”.\n\nBased on the conflicting answers, “frequency of AF episode” and “recent symptom\nseverity” were likely measured with substantial error. “Time of last AF episode” might\n\nbe, relatively, a more accurate indicator of patients’ current AF burden post-PVA.\n\nAs aresult, all but the two problematic covariates were considered for statistical\nregression, including age, gender, racial or ethnic background, marital status, educational\nattainment, residence, work status, time of AF diagnosis, AF type, and time of last AF\nepisode.\n\nSince age seemed to exhibit a non-linear but monotonic relationship with the overall\n\nscore, a quadratic term was added to the model to improve linearity.\n\nTable 18 summarizes the predictor selection results from backward, forward, and\nstepwise regression.

These include\nresults from questionnaire development (Chapter 3) and analyses of the questionnaire\nscores (Chapter 4). We will also discuss the implications of the results, the strengths, and\nthe limitations of this thesis. We conclude with suggestions for future research.\n\n5.1 Summary of results\n\nThis thesis was built upon previous qualitative research. From focus groups with\narrhythmia patients in Canada, AF was found to impact patients’ mental wellbeing, social\nrelationships, livelihood, and finances. Existing (HR)QoL questionnaires do not\nadequately measure the AF impact. Most questionnaires were developed to assess QoL\nchanges before and after treatment. Therefore, their primary focus is on physical\nfunctioning, symptoms, ability to perform daily activities, and affect. This led to our\nproposal to develop a new questionnaire to comprehensively understand the effects of AF\nalong the patient journey — covering broader life impacts and challenges surrounding\ndiagnosis (a central theme of the A F patient experience).\n\n5.1.1 Results of questionnaire development\n5.1.1.1 Construct of interest\n\nHRQoL questionnaires typically take a snapshot of the patient’s physical functioning,\nsymptoms, and psychological wellbeing over a four-week period. Validated ones are\nsuitable for evaluating the effects of interventions during the treatment phase. Beyond\nthis need to evaluate treatment efficacy, there is little interest in understanding QoL\nduring symptom onset and how the disease affects multiple aspects of patients’\nwellbeing. This is where the MAP-AF differs from existing instruments as a patient-\nreported measure that addresses these gaps and recognizes the dynamics of the patient\njourney. The most prominent concerns of patients fluctuate over the clinical course of\nAF,",
    "Page_91": "79\n\nWhile the MAP-AF can be considered a measure of patient outcomes, one domain\n(‘Diagnostic Experience”) is dedicated to measuring patients’ experiences with medical\ncare. The international PaRIS survey, developed for patients with chronic conditions,\nsimilarly measures both important outcomes and experiences of health care in one\n\ninstrument!.\n\n“Financial Impact” and “Social Support” are two domains of the MAP-AF that are\ntypically considered non- health-related. Although non-health-related aspects of wellbeing\nare less likely to change due to medical interventions, they are nevertheless affected by\ndisease and experienced by patients. The LupusPRO questionnaire developed by Jolly et\nal. (2012) measures both health-related and non-health-related aspects of QoL of\nsystemic lupus erythematosus patients”. A holistic understanding of the impact of disease\nhelps researchers and clinicians gain insight into patient needs and improve healthcare\n\nservices?.\n\n5.1.1.2 Factor structure and internal consistency\n\nAfter exploratory factor analysis and item reduction, the MA P-AF questionnaire had 16\nitems and five domains: “Affect”, “Social Support”, “Financial Impact’, “Major Life\nEvents”, and “Diagnostic Experience”. Considering we did not have a priori hypotheses\nabout the number of factors underlying the items, the factor solution came out\nunexpectedly clean. Results of EFA can often be quite messy, conflicting, and difficult to\ninterpret, especially when sample sizes are small and loadings are weak’.\n\nWhen the threshold factor loading was set to 0.35, there were very few cross-loading\nitems: two in the 5-factor solution, one in the 6-factor solution, and none in the 7-factor\nsolution. Furthermore, the same factor solutions emerged even under different data\nconditions. The rotated factor loadings were robust to the factor extraction methods (ULS\nvs. iPAF), rotation methods (promax vs. direct oblimin), missing value imputation (CCA\nvs. EM), and log transformation of one skewed item (i.e., item 25). Based on parsimony\nand interpretability, the 6-factor structure was initially chosen as the solution for further\nscrutiny using measurement properties like the item-total correlation, Cronbach’s alpha,\n\nand inter-factor correlation.",
    "Page_92": "80\n\nThe final MA P-AF had five domains because one factor (original factor 6) was deemed\nproblematic. The three items in the factor were difficult to interpret (i.e., does not appear\nto reflect one unifying concept) and had low item-total correlations. The factor itself had\npoor internal consistency (0.70 to 0.95 considered good internal consistency)‘ and a low\ncorrelation with the other five factors. We also failed to redistribute the three items to the\nother established factors, ultimately resulting in our decision to remove the items from\nthe final questionnaire.\n\nFor the remaining five factors, all except for “Major Life Events” had good internal\nconsistency. The “Major Life Events” factor had a borderline Cronbach’s alpha of 0.68.\nDespite having only two items, the “Diagnostic Experience” factor was stable and had a\n\nhigh alpha of 0.78.\n\nThe result of EFA is sample-dependent, and one of the sample characteristics that may\naffect EFA results is where patients are on the patient journey. Our study recruited\npatients who had a pulmonary vein ablation — most patients in our sample identified\nthemselves to be in the treatment and beyond phase, and many were “cured”.\n\nWhile our post-PVA sample provided us with an overview of the patient journey, we\nrecognize that the factor loadings and the factor structure of the MAP-AF may be\ndifferent had we used a different patient sample. For example, if we administered the 35-\nitem MAP-AF to a sample of recently diagnosed patients, the factor structure we obtain\nmay be quite different.\n\n5.1.2 Results of questionnaire scores\n5.1.2.1 Descriptive analyses of questionnaire scores\n\nThe overall MAP-AF scores were not high for our sample — the mean was 37.8 points out\nof 100. Likewise, “Social Support”, “Financial Impact”, and “Diagnostic Experiences”\nhad mean scores less than 3 on a 7-point Likert scale. “Affect” had a mean score of 3.76,\nand “Major Life Events” had the highest mean score of 4.12. The result is likely a\nconsequence of a sample composed of mostly “cured” patients who no longer experience\n\nepisodes and symptoms of AF. Over 80% of our patients were diagnosed more than three",
    "Page_93": "81\n\nyears ago, 41% last experienced an episode more than a year ago, and 42% experienced\nminimal to no symptoms recently. The perceived impact of AF may be lesser for\nindividuals who no longer experience the condition than those who are actively\n\nexperiencing the disease.\n\nDuring sample selection, we recruited only patients who had a pulmonary vein ablation.\nPatients typically receive such a procedure if they remain symptomatic after rate and\nrhythm medications. By recruiting PVA patients, we would reduce the inclusion of\nasymptomatic patients, who are more likely to be incidentally diagnosed (and hence ill-\nsuited for answering diagnosis-related questions). Unfortunately, we were unable to\nexclude all incidentally diagnosed individuals with this eligibility criteria. From patient\ncomments, we found that several were diagnosed when presented to the emergency\ndepartment for other reasons or during routine physical examinations. The inclusion of\nthese patients likely lowered the “Diagnostic Experiences” mean scores since they would\nhave selected “strongly disagree” for the items when in reality, the most suitable response\n\nwas “non-applicable”.\n\n5.1.2.2 Multivariable linear regression of the overall score\n\nThe total score on the MAP-AF reflects the extent to which patients have been affected\nby AF across all domains. Multivariable linear regression found age, marital status,\neducational attainment, and time of last AF episode to be associated with the overall\nscore. Generally, patients were more impacted by AF if they were younger, divorced or\nseparated, had lower education, or experienced more recent episodes of AF. Randolph et\nal. (2016) conducted similar analyses using the A trial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of\nLife (A FEQT) scale and found female sex, younger age, new-onset AF, higher heart rate,\nand the presence of comorbidities to be significantly associated with a reduced QoL).\nAnother study also found sex differences in QoL improvements over time, in which\nfemale patients showed less improvement in AFEQT scores over 1 year than male\npatients®.\n\nBased on previous literature that found women to be more symptomatic yet less likely to\nbe offered an ablation, we hypothesized that there would be gender differences in the AF",

Nevertheless, when time\nof last AF episode was tentatively excluded from the model, the effect of gender became\nsignificant (p-value went from 0.18 to 0.036). The qualitative conclusions for the other\ncovariates remained the same. We speculate that the effect of gender on A F impact was\nlikely confounded by disease severity and disease burden. Presumably, female patients\nwere more impacted by AF than male patients because they experienced more frequent\nepisodes and more severe symptoms even after pulmonary vein ablation. When disease\nseverity was accounted for using the variable “time of last episode”, gender was no\n\nlonger significant.\n\nThe four variables (age, marital status, educational attainment, and time of last AF\nepisode) explained 20.4% of the variance of the overall score. The remaining unexplained\nvariance could be attributed to comorbidities, treatment effectiveness, and other AF\ncharacteristics. Future studies should include valid and accurate measurements of the\nabove variables (e.g., using validated scales to assess AF symptom severity).\n\n5.1.2.3 Predictors\n\nThis section discusses the relationships between selected predictors and the five MAP-AF\ndomains based on the additional analyses.\n\nFirst, our results supported previous research that found women to have a more difficult\ntime trying to get a diagnosis for AF. Scores on “Diagnostic Experience” were higher for\nfemales than males after adjusting for all covariates. Several patients also provided\npersonal anecdotes in the comments describing how a few physicians they encountered\nwere dismissive of their symptoms and concerns, which in many cases delayed their\ndiagnosis or treatment and affected their care. Empathetic care was extremely important\nin shaping the patient experience.\n\nSecond, divorced or separated patients had the highest scores on all five domains\ncompared to other marital statuses. Married patients were least impacted by AF; widowed\nor single patients consistently did better than divorced or separated patients. A study",
    "Page_95": "83\n\ninvestigating the effect of divorce on mental and physical health, as measured by the\nShort Form 36 (SF-36), found divorce to significantly impact the wellbeing of both men\n\nand women’.\n\n5.2 Implications\n\nGood measurement development practices collect qualitative data directly from the target\npopulation to generate candidate items for psychometric analysis. The MA P-AF\nquestionnaire that assesses the impact of AF on the lives of Canadian patients was\ndeveloped based on focus groups and interviews conducted across Canadian provinces.\nTwo other PROMs developed in Canada are the University of Toronto A trial Fibrillation\nSymptom Severity scale (AFSS) and the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life\n(AFEQT). The AFEQT is a HRQoL questionnaire developed in both the US and Canada\nthat assesses AF symptoms, patients’ ability to perform daily activities, treatment\nconcerns, and treatment satisfaction. It has been used in clinical trials to measure QoL\nchanges due to interventions!°\"\"?, The MA P-AF questionnaire is unlike typical HRQoL\nmeasures, as patient experiences and the impact of AF on broader realms of wellbeing\nwere measured. Our construct of interest is most similar to the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) PaRIS survey for chronic disease\npatients, where both patient experiences and patient outcomes are measured in one\ninstrument!. Despite nuances in the construct measured, the AF impact that we assessed\nshares similar predictors with (HR)QoL.\n\nOur study demonstrated a statistically significant gender bias in AF diagnoses. Previous\nreports of this phenomenon were from qualitative interviews'’, and we were able to\nsupport this observation with quantitative evidence. In line with results from the focus\ngroups and patient journey maps, female patients in our study more frequently felt\ndismissed when communicating symptoms to physicians and found the diagnostic\nprocess to be more difficult than male patients. Unfortunately, women were also less\nlikely to be offered or receive an ablation than men during the treatment phase”*. The\nliterature consistently reports women to experience greater symptom severity and\nfrequency”®, yet they are more likely than men to experience difficulties and delays in\ndiagnosis and treatment. One of the potential reasons for this observation is the perceived",
    "Page_96": "84\n\nbias among healthcare providers'*. A study found that women experiencing syncope, one\nof the possible symptoms of AF, were often dismissed by Emergency Medical Services\nas a symptom of feminine conditions like menstruation, menopause, or pregnancy\"*.\nFurther investigation into the factors contributing to gender differences in the patient\n\nexperience is warranted to achieve equitable and effective healthcare services.\n\n5.3 Strengths and limitations\n\nThis study has several strengths, including the performance of sensitivity analyses,\nadditional exploratory analyses, collecting patient feedback on the questionnaire, high\ncompletion rate, and survey features that allow a better understanding of missing data.\n\nFirst, the results of exploratory factor analysis were robust to various data conditions. By\nperforming sensitivity analyses, we were able to see whether conclusions would change\n\nunder varying circumstances and justify our decisions.\n\nAlthough the MA P-AF still needs to undergo extensive validation before its scores can be\nmeaningfully analyzed, we conducted many additional analyses that functioned to\ngenerate hypotheses for future research.\n\nThe textbox included at the end of the online questionnaire also generated lots of\nqualitative data. While we did not conduct a formal analysis of the data, the comments\nprovided by patients helped inform some of the limitations and future directions of our\nstudy.\n\nThe MAP-AF questionnaires had a high completion rate of 87% and few missing data.\nWe show that web administration of surveys is feasible in our age demographic, which\nhad a mean of 63.8 years and a max of 83 years. The skip patterns, N/A options, and the\ncomment box features allowed us to categorize and better understand missing data.\n\nA thorough investigation of missing values was done for the 24 items prior to EFA\n(eleven highly irrelevant items were removed). Of 277 who took the questionnaire, 14\n(5.1%) individuals did not answer at least one of the 24 items. Patients’ feedback\n\nsuggests some of the questions did not apply to their circumstances. Patients commented",
    "Page_97": "85\n\non how the questionnaire made assumptions about their experiences and how some\nquestions were difficult to answer because they no longer have AF. Some patients\nindicated that they did not experience symptoms before they were diagnosed, rendering\nthem unable to answer the diagnosis-related questions. There were only four questions\namong the 24 items with a N/A option. There were no missing values for these four items\n— missing values only occurred where the N/A option was not available. Three of the 14\nindividuals with missing values have used the N/A option at least once. We speculate that\nif a N/A option existed for the items they missed, they would have selected it instead. For\nthe remaining 11 individuals, the possible reasons for missingness were provided in the\nresults. Briefly, these include suboptimal question wording, the nearby presence of family\nmembers, forgetfulness, and again, the lack of a N/A option when the question did not\napply.\n\nThere are also limitations to this study. These include sample selection, possible recall\nbias, suboptimal design of clinical questions, lack of consideration for comorbidities, and\nthe effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic on social-related questions.\n\nFirst, our sample is a convenience non-probability sample of 500 consecutive post-PVA\npatients. Some patients were diagnosed a long time ago and no longer experienced AF.\nOver half of the questionnaire respondents were diagnosed more than 5 years ago, and\nanother 30% diagnosed more than 3 years ago. Forty-one percent last experienced an\nepisode more than a year ago, and 42% recently experienced minimal to no symptoms.\nMoreover, some incidentally diagnosed patients were included in our sample. For these\n\npatients, some questions were difficult to answer.\n\nThere might have been substantial recall bias for patients who were either diagnosed a\nlong time ago or no longer experienced AF. It is also possible that the recall of memories\nmay have depended on the success of the ablation (or other treatments).\n\nNext, the following questions were used to ascertain the clinical characteristics of our\npatients:\n\n“how often do you have an episode of atrial fibrillation”",
    "Page_98": "86\n\n“when was the last time you had an episode of atrial fibrillation”\n“how would you describe the severity of your symptoms as of recently”\n\nThese questions were particularly confusing for patients who no longer had atrial\nfibrillation. We thought these patients would have responded to the above questions with\n“less than one episode a year’, “last episode was more than | year ago”, and “minimal to\nno symptoms as of recently”. However, we found the questions to be suboptimally\nworded, such that some patients responded in a way that reflected their past AF burden\nwhen they still had AF. We thus anticipate some misclassification to be present and a\ngreater proportion of patients with a lower AF severity and burden. In the future, a\nquestion that clarifies whether respondents are still in atrial fibrillation or not may\nremedy this problem. Respondents could then be directed to questions appropriate to\nthem. Alternatively, validated symptom scales could be used to capture the clinical\n\nprofile of our patients more accurately.\n\nIn addition to the above limitations, some patients had multiple arrhythmias and\ncomorbidities that made it difficult to attribute their reduced wellbeing to a particular\nsource like AF. For example, patients with both AF and atrial flutter found it difficult to\ndiscern the effects between the two arrhythmias. Some of the other comorbidities that\nwere present in our sample include cardiomyopathy, supraventricular tachycardia,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and erectile dysfunction.\nA few patients stated that their comorbidities had a greater impact on their life than their\nAF. Comorhidities likely explain a portion of the variance in the MAP-AF scores, but\nthey were not measured in this study.\n\nQuestionnaire data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic when lockdowns and\nsocial distancing were imposed. The focus groups and patient journey mapping were\nconducted during pre-pandemic times. The pandemic may have skewed responses to\nquestions about patients’ social relationships and social life satisfaction. Some, not all,\npatients answered as if the pandemic did not exist (i.e., what life would be like in pre-\n\npandemic times).",
    "Page_99": "87\n\nLast, we did not factor analyze employment-related questions because they were not\napplicable to greater than 10% of our patient population. Our next steps would be to\nconduct a separate EFA on all 35 items using a smaller subset of 159 participants to\n\nwhom employment-related questions applied.\n\n5.4 Improvements of the MAP-AF\n\nIn addition to addressing the limitations described above, we also summarize patients’\n\nfeedback and suggestions for improvement.\n\nIn the comments section, many patients described their personal experiences and\nmentioned concerns unaddressed by the MA P-AF.\n\nFirst, the MAP-AF did not adequately explore the stress of the treatment phase, which\nprimarily comes from negative experiences with the healthcare system and the side\neffects or ineffectiveness of treatment. Many patients mentioned the long waitlist for an\nablation — a patient described getting cardioverted seven times while waiting for an\nablation. These patients signed up for an ablation in many cases because the side effects\nof medications were intolerable. For example, the physical functioning and energy levels\nof some patients deteriorated, and many were unable to pursue their desired lifestyle. The\ndifficulty of getting an ablation, an appointment, or a referral can greatly delay treatment\nand worsen prognosis. Patients also mentioned the inconsistent approaches to\nmanagement from the many physicians they see and inconsistent experiences in\nemergency departments. However, not all patients’ experiences were negative. Several\npatients expressed that the empathetic and compassionate care they received outweighed\nany costs or inconveniences associated with their condition and treatment. This further\nreinforces the importance of considering both experiences with practical aspects of care\n(i.e., patient experiences) and effects of care (i.e., patient outcomes).\n\nSecond, patients described additional effects of AF that were not outlined in the MA P-\nAF. These included the effect of AF on their sleep and their fulfillment of their sexual\nlives. Most frequently mentioned was the inability to perform their desired level of\nphysical activity. This significantly affected the patient’s health, autonomy (e.g., unable",
    "Page_100": "88\n\nto drive a car and go shopping alone), and social life. Even for patients who had a\nsuccessful ablation and were able to return to an active lifestyle, they worried about\nwhether AF would return due to them being active again.\n\nIn general, there was considerable uncertainty surrounding AF, which produced anxiety\nfor many patients.\n\n5.5 Conclusion and future directions\n\nThe MAP-AF questionnaire was developed and initially validated in a sample of post-\npulmonary vein ablation patients with AF in London, Ontario. The questionnaire contains\n16 items and five domains: “Affect”, “Social Support”, “Major Life Events”, “Financial\nImpact”, “Diagnostic Experience”. Younger age, being divorced or separated, having a\nlower education, and experiencing more recent episodes were associated with a more\nnegative patient journey. While the effect of gender on overall AF impact appears to be\nconfounded by the time of last AF episode, gender was nevertheless an important\npredictor for the patient’s diagnostic experience. Confirming previous qualitative\nfindings, female patients were more likely to have their symptoms dismissed and report\nhaving a more difficult time trying to get a diagnosis than male patients. Healthcare\nprofessionals should increase their awareness of the challenges associated with symptom\nonset and their own affective responses to patients presenting with palpitations and other\nAF symptoms. Timely diagnosis and treatment initiation are goals shared by both patients\nand physicians.\n\nOur study demonstrates the importance of studying both patient experiences and\noutcomes of care. More research is needed to understand the lived experiences of patients\nwith AF — a condition that is associated with a lot of uncertainties. The next steps for this\nstudy include revising the MA P-AF based on patient feedback (e.g., expanding the\nquestionnaire to cover employment effects and treatment impacts) and administer the\nnew questionnaire in a separate sample to obtain more evidence supporting the validity of\nthe measure to assess the AF patient experiences and promote better AF management.",
