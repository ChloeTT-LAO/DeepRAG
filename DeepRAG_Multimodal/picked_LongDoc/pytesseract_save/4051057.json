    "Page_11": "Abstract\n\nTropical peat swamp forests are unique ecosystems with a complex interplay between\nthe forest vegetation and peat soil. The forest trees provide the material for peat\nformation, while the depth of the peat determines forest structure through influences\non soil hydrology, chemistry, and nutrient availability. These forests are important for\ntheir provision of various ecosystem services, the vast quantities of carbon they store,\nand the biodiversity they contain, yet are severely threatened by degradation as a\nresult of logging, drainage, and fire. This study aimed to investigate the effects these\nforms of disturbance have on forest structure and functioning. Six tree plots in mixed\nswamp forest of the Sabangau catchment in Central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo,\nwere studied. These plots experienced differential histories of logging, drainage, and\nfire, and are of varying distances from the river and therefore peat depth. To\ndetermine the effects of disturbance on forest structure and carbon content, all trees in\neach plot were identified to species and measured to determine biomass and carbon\ncontent which depends on tree density, tree size, and species composition. Distance\nfrom the river tended to increase tree density, biomass and carbon content.\nDisturbance influenced species composition, with burnt edge habitat dissimilar from\nother secondary and primary forest, and decreased tree diameter, biomass, and\ncarbon content. Biomass estimates of the forest, excluding peat, found total\nvegetation biomass to be as high as 423 Mg/ha in low disturbance interior forest.\nIncluding the peat, carbon content of low disturbance mixed swamp forest may be as\nhigh as 1977 Mg/ha, though was decreased by 30% in high disturbance areas. This\nwas the first study to attain total carbon estimates of this forest which may be used for\ncarbon budgeting initiatives, though comparisons of different biomass equations\nsuggest that peat swamp-specific allometric equations are required to increase the\naccuracy of estimates. Changes in species composition influence not only carbon\nstorage but also other flora and fauna in the community through changes in the traits\ntrees possess. Twenty-three traits of the most abundant tree species in each plot were\ntherefore measured to better understand tropical peat swamp forest ecology, develop\na non-species focused habitat quality monitoring program, assess the impact tree trait\nchanges have on primate communities, and gain descriptive information of peat\nswamp forest trees. River distance did not seem to affect most tree traits though\ndisturbance affected several traits. A commonness of pneumatophores may indicate\nlow-disturbance mixed swamp forest and could be incorporated into trait-based\nmonitoring. This was the first study to use tree traits in this way to monitor disturbance\nin tropical rainforest. The changes in tree traits as a result of disturbance may have\nnegative impacts on local communities of orangutans and gibbons, as well as other\nforest fauna. This knowledge can be used to improve management and conservation\nof tropical peat swamp forest.\n\nxi",

    "Page_15": "Chapter 1\n\nChapter 1: Background and Study Location\n1.1.1 Tropical Peat Swamp Forests\n\nTropical peat swamp forest is a unique ecosystem, with a complex and\ninterdependent relationship between the forest vegetation and the soil peat\n(Page etal., 1999). Waterlogging creates anoxic conditions which prevent\nmicrobial decay of organic material, causing litterfall from rainforest trees to\naccumulate and form peat. The peat, in turn, determines the hydrological,\nchemical, and nutrient conditions which influence tree growth and forest\nstructure. This dynamic interaction creates one of the most complex and diverse\n\necosystems on earth (Page etal., 1999).\n\nThe accumulation of peat may continue for thousands of years (Page at\nal., 2004), eventually creating domes above groundwater level which can reach\ndepths up to 20 m (Page etal., 1999). The convex surface of the dome allows no\nrivers to flow into them, and so the only source of water, nutrients, and solutes\nare atmospheric inputs such as rain, aerosols, and dust (Richards, 1996). The\npeat is therefore acidic and low in nutrients. These peat domes form inland, often\nstraddling watersheds between two catchments. In pristine peat swamps the\nwater table is close to or above the peat surface throughout the year, fluctuating\nwith rainfall. Water levels are highest during the wet season with areas flooded\nover a meter, while in the dry season the water table may be just below the peat\n\nsurface (Reiley et al., 1996; Wosten et al., 2006).",
    "Page_16": "Chapter 1\n\nPeat depth increases toward the center of the dome, producing a gradient\nof nutrient availability, hydrology, chemistry and organic matter dynamics\n(Anderson, 1963; Page et al., 1999). The forest growing on the dome of peat is\narranged in concentric circles of different forest sub-types corresponding to\ndifferences in peat depths. The outermost sub-type formed on the thinnest peat\nlayer is mixed swamp forest. The canopy in mixed swamp forest is uneven with\ntrees reaching up to 45 m tall and abundant undergrowth vegetation (Richards,\n1996). The movement of water down slope from higher on the dome and\noccasional flooding during the wet season providing solutes from the river results\nin greater nutrient and dissolved oxygen content of mixed swamp forest\ncompared to forest higher on the dome. There is also the potential that, on very\nthin layers of peat, plant roots can pass through the peat to the mineral layer\nbelow. As a result, mixed swamp forest is higher in species diversity than other\nforest types found in peat swamp forest, and generally supports larger trees\n\n(Richards, 1996).\n\nThe majority of the world’s tropical peatlands are located in Southeast\nAsia, with 62% located in the Indo-Malayan realm alone which includes Malaysia,\nIndonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Phillipines (Yule, 2010).

Peatlands act as water control\nsystems by storing water during the wet season to prevent flooding and gradually\nreleasing water during the dry season (Wosten et al., 2006; Yule, 2010). The\npeat also stabilizes the landscape by preventing erosion and protects water\nquality for riverine, estuarine, and coastal fisheries by filtering out pollutants,\nsequestering heavy metals and toxins from the environment or lessening their\n\nimpact (Reiley et al., 1996; Maltby and Proctor, 1996).\n\nThese forests impact not only surrounding environments but also\nworldwide global carbon cycling and climate change (Page et al., 2002). The\naccumulation of peat leads to large stores of carbon. Because peat can reach\ndepths of over 20 m (Page etal., 1999), tropical peat swamp forests are among\n\n3",

Species diversity was historically assumed to be low\ncompared to other Southeast Asian forest types due to poor growing conditions\nas a result of high acidity, waterlogging, and nutrient-poor soils (Yule, 2010). This\nbelief, coupled with accessibility issues and difficult field conditions, meant very\nlitte biodiversity surveying was conducted in peat swamps until recently. Recent\nsurveys, however, have revealed that tree diversity can be comparable and even\ngreater than that of some forests on mineral soils (Posa et al., 2011). Over 927\nflowering plants and ferns have been identified in Bornean peat swamp forest\n(Anderson 1963). Many rare and endangered mammalian species can be found\nin peat swamp forest, including elephants, tapirs, leopards, rhinoceroses,\nproboscis monkeys, and tigers (Yule, 2010). These forests are important for the\nconservation of a number of endangered primate species, including orangutans,\nlisted by IUCN as critically endangered (Wich et al., 2008). There are also\nseveral notable rare endemic species of blackwater fish and a high diversity of\nbirds and insects (Reiley et al., 1996). The knowledge of flora and fauna is far\nfrom complete, yet these forests are vanishing before we know what we are\nlosing as Bornean wildlife competes with timber companies and plantations for\n\nforest space (Commitante et al., 2003).",

Deforestation, drainage, fire, and land\nconversion contribute to the rapid vanishing of tropical peat swamp forest, such\nthat little pristine forest remains (Reiley et al., 1996). Tropical peat swamp forests\nare highly fragile and strongly influenced by perturbations. This fragility stems\nfrom the fact that the entire ecosystem depends on the peat substrate which in\nturns relies on adequate water, canopy cover, and leaf litter inputs, and even\n\nsmall disturbances can upset this balance (Page et al., 1999).\n\nPeat swamp forests are an important source of valuable commercial\ntimbers (Richards, 1996), and have been subject to widespread logging, both\nlegal and illegal. Currently more than 80% of the remaining peat swamp forests\nin Indonesia are occupied by logging concessions, and Indonesia experiences\namong the greatest deforestation rates in the world, estimated at 2.2% per year\nin 2005 and likely increasing (Posa etal., 2011). Legal logging concessions in\nIndonesia employ selective logging in which trees of high value are removed\nusing minimal mechanization with hand-held chainsaws and light weight railways\nto carry timber out. Selective logging results in the removal of emergent trees,\nand when extensive reduces canopy height and cover (Hamard et al., 2010) and\nalters species composition, often reducing species diversity as pioneer species\ncolonize the gaps. More damaging than selective logging, however, is the\n\nwidespread uncontrolled illegal logging. Illegal logging is believed responsible for\n\n5",

A combination of events after\n1998, including political chaos, widespread corruption, and unemployment as a\nresult of economic crash, resulted in rampant illegal logging activities across\nBomeo, targeting unprotected forest, logging concessions, and conservation\nareas alike (Commitante et al., 2003). Initially only trees of highest value were\nremoved, as in legal operations, but once these were removed trees of\nincreasingly smaller size and value were taken. Trees as small as 15 cm\ndiameter were cut, despite the legal limit of 30-50 cm (Commitante et al., 2003).\nAs a result, species of high value, particularly ramin (Gonystylus bancanus),\nhave been logged to near-extinction. Adding to the damage, canals are dug in\nthe peat to allow timber to be floated out of the forest. Canals cause drainage of\nthe surrounding peat, resulting in widespread effects on hydrology and stability,\nand creating susceptibility to fire as the open canopy, drier microclimate, and\nlogging debris acting as fuel cause logged forests to be many times more likely to\n\nburn (Woods, 1989; Langner and Siegert, 2009).\n\nUndisturbed peat swamp forest is naturally fire-resistant due to the high\nwater table. Once drained, however, the dry peat is highly flammable and once lit\nthe peat can burn for months both above and below the surface, with fires\nextremely difficult to extinguish (Woods, 1989; Wosten et al., 2006). Disturbed\ntropical peat swamp forests are thus more vulnerable to destruction by fire than\nany other forest type (Langner et al., 2007; Langner and Siegert, 2009), and\nbecause burning does not naturally occur the flora and fauna are not adapted to\n\n6",

Burned forest has a lower canopy cover, decreased\nspecies richness, and reduced tree density compared to unburned forest (Yeager\net al., 2003).

Wildfires have destroyed hundreds of thousands of\nhectares on Borneo and are becoming more frequent as a result of the increased\ndegradation of these forests (Woods, 1989; Page et al., 2002; Langner and\nSievert 2009).

Four forest sub-types are\n\nlocated on the peat dome: mixed swamp forest, transition forest, low pole forest,\n\n9",

The water table can drop to 40\ncm below the peat surface at the end of the dry season, but is typically much\nhigher and can be several meters above the peat surface during the wet season.\nThe surface water is very acidic with an average pH of 3.6, while surface peat pH\n\naverages 3.1 (Page etal., 1999).\n\nSabangau is particularly important due to high abundance of flagship\nprimate and felid species.

Selective logging focussed\nmainly on two species, ramin and meranti (Shorea sp.). Railways were\nconstructed from the river into the forest to extract timber. After the last\nconcession ended in 1997, the area experienced extensive illegal logging,\npeaking from 1999 to 2003. During this period, thousands of small canals,\napproximately 1 m deep and 1-2 m wide, were constructed by loggers to float\ntimber out of the forest. The formation of a Community Patrol team by CIMTROP\nin 2003 and subsequent governmental protection of the area in 2004 has ended\nall logging and so the forest has since been regenerating.

Satellite imaging\nshowed that, prior to initiation of the project, the area consisted of primary,\nsecondary and plantation forest, and some shrub land (Sabiham, 2004). One\nmillion hectares of forest were cleared, and over 4000 km of drainage channels,\nsome up to 30 m wide, were constructed to lower the water table (Aldhous,\n2004).

Not only is carbon\nstored in the vegetation, as in other forest types, but also in the peat, making\nthese among the largest terrestrial carbon stores on earth. Even at moderate\npeat depths, peat swamp forest contains more than ten times the amount of\ncarbon per unit area as other tropical forests, but with peat in Borneo reaching\ndepths of over 20 m, the carbon storage capacity of these ecosystems is\nenormous (Page et al. 1999; Hooijer, 2006). Indonesian peatlands alone are\nestimated to hold 97 Gt of carbon (Page et al., 2011). When these forests\nbecome degraded, however, they not only lose their capacity to act as a carbon\nsink but begin to rapidly release carbon into the atmosphere which has been\naccumulating for millennia. Of the total area of peat swamp forest in Southeast\nAsia, ithas been estimated that approximately half has been cleared and drained\nfor agriculture, and the majority of what remains has suffered degradation and\n\ndrainage from timber extraction (Verwer and van der Meer, 2010).\n\nHuman-related disturbances cause a significant loss of carbon from\ntropical peat swamp forest, as logging and burning lead to the removal of\nvegetation and drainage leads to decomposition of the peat (Hooijer et al., 2010).\n\nThe high water table of pristine tropical peat swamp forest prevents\n\n19",

Drained peat subsides rapidly such that the surface of\nthe peat can drop by several meters over a century (Maltby and Proctor, 1996).\nAs a result of the oxidation and decomposition of drained peat, Indonesia emits\n\napproximately 600 Mt of carbon each year (Yule, 2010).\n\nMore dramatic than the effect of peat oxidation, however, is combustion.\nBurning substantially speeds the process of peat degradation, affecting forest\nstructure and biodiversity and releasing vast quantities of carbon dioxide. Fires,\nunfortunately, are common on Borneo and increasing in frequency. They are\nmost frequent during dry periods, typically coinciding with El Nifo events which\noccur every 5-10 years and cause severe drought (Commitante et al., 2003;\nYule, 2010). Once an area has burned previously it becomes much more likely to\nburn again (Woods, 1989; Brown, 1998), and with up to 20 m of accumulated\npeat there is a substantial amount of fuel (Page et al., 1999), allowing fires to\nreoccur many times. These fires have enormous impacts on greenhouse gas\nemissions, the health of humans and wildlife, and economy. As an example, the\ndrainage and forest clearance associated with the Mega Rice Project contributed\nto major fires on Borneo in 1997.

Allometric equations have not yet been developed specifically for\ntropical peat swamp forests, and so equations for other moist tropical forest types\nmust be used (Verwer and van der Meer, 2010). Mass depends not only on wood\nvolume, however, but also on its density (Swaine and Whitmore, 1988; Chave et\nal., 2005), which differs between species. Pioneer species invest in rapid growth\nat the expense of wood density, whereas species which are slower growing can\ninvest more in tissue density (Swaine and Whitmore, 1988; Verwer and van der\nMeer, 2010). Furthermore, pioneer species with low wood density decompose\nmore rapidly than species with higher density, contributing less to the dead\norganic matter pools of litter, coarse woody debris, and peat. Regenerating forest\ntherefore typically has lower carbon storage as a result of smaller trees with\n\nlower wood density.\n\nDead organic material, including litter and coarse woody debris, can\ncontribute to biomass.

The biomass\nand carbon stored in forest vegetation depends on the number of trees, the size\nof trees, and the composition of species due to species-specific differences in\nwood density (Chave et al. 2005; Verwer and van der Meer, 2010). A change in\nany of these measures can result in alterations in the amount of carbon stored in\n\nthe forest.\n\n2.4.1 Tree Density\n\nAverage tree density was 1734 trees/ha. Tree density values at LAHG\nattained through LiDAR analysis (Light Detection and Ranging optical remote-\nsensing technology) were similar to that found in this study for LD 3.0 at 1956\ntrees/ha (Kroseder et al., 2012), though Waldes and Page (2002) found much\nhigher density in Sabangau mixed swamp forest at 3112 trees/ha. There is often\na reciprocal relationship with tree density and tree size (Marchant, 2012). It is\nlikely that some disturbed forest was included in measurements by Waldes and\nPage and so, being sampled more than ten years previous to this study, there\nmay have been a higher density of small trees which were later replaced by a\nlower density of larger trees. Tree density for Sabangau is similar but higher than\n\nwhat has been reported in Sumatran undisturbed mixed swamp forest at 1303\n\n35",

Lowland dipterocarp tree density has been reported as\n1612 trees/ha in a forest in Central Kalimantan (Kroseder et al., 2012) and 238\ntrees/ha in West Kalimantan (Cannon and Leighton, 1998). Other moist tropical\nforest types also exhibit lower tree density. For example, primary tropical moist\nforest in Cameroon had a density of 221 trees/ha and Sri Lankan primary moist\n\nforest had 384 trees/ha (Brown et al., 1989).\n\nTree density tended to increase with distance from the river, contrary to\npredictions, with no effect from level of disturbance. Because of the trade-off\nbetween tree density and size, with either few large trees or many small trees\n(Marchant, 2012), it was predicted that density would be greatest at high\ndisturbance plots and highest at the edge, since it is made of young trees\ncolonizing outwards from the forest. However, the edge plot had the lowest\ndensity. This is likely the result of the high abundance of trees smaller than the 7\ncm diameter sampling limit (Marchant, 2012). This study found no effect of\ndisturbance on tree density. Other studies have reported changes in tree density\nas a result of disturbance, though the direction of change is variable. Mixed\nswamp forest in Sumatra found an increase in tree density ten years after\nselective logging, with 2,492 trees/ha (Gunawan et al., 2012), which is nearly\n\ndouble what was reported for unlogged forest. Similarly, logged peat swamp\n\n36",

The logged HD 1.8 plot did have\na slightly higher density than LD 1.8 with a difference of 5%, but without\nadditional tree plots it cannot be known whether these results would be\nsignificant. Peat swamp forest tree plots which experienced drainage, indirect fire\ndamage, and wind damage, however, had greatly reduced tree densities,\naveraging 971 trees/ha (Gunawan et al., 2012). This study similarly saw a\ndecrease in tree density as a result of drainage, with a difference in 15%\nbetween HD 3.0 and LD 3.0. Replication of plots, however, is required to uncover\nwhether these differences would be significant. If logging tends to increase\ndensity while drainage decreases density, this could explain why no overall effect\nof disturbance was found in this study. The differences in the direction of effect of\ndisturbance through logging and drainage may be explained by the persistence\nof trees when they are killed. In logging, trees are removed from the area leaving\nopen spaces on the ground which can be filled by smaller trees (Finegan, 1984),\nresulting in an increase in density. When trees fall as a result of drainage,\nhowever, the dead trees remain and so there may not be as much exposed soil\nwhere young trees can colonize, possibly resulting in a decrease in tree density\n\ndue to lower recruitment.\n\n2.4.2 Tree Size\n\nTree size, as estimated by diameter at breast and basal height, was not\n\ninfluenced by the distance from the river but did tend to decrease with\n\n37",

In the\nlogged plot, the largest trees would have been preferentially removed as these\nwould be most valuable (Commitante et al., 2003), and in drained plots, the\nlargest heaviest trees may be the ones most likely to fall (Yamada et al., 2001).\nIn the logged and drained plots, the gaps would be colonized by small trees\n(Finegan, 1989), reducing average tree diameter. Average total basal area was\n42.4 m2/ha, which is greater than values found by LiDAR in the Sabangau forest\n\nat 30.7 m’/ha (Kroseder et al., 2012).\n\n2.4.3 Species Composition\n\nSpecies composition of the edge plot (HD 1.0) was highly dissimilar from\nthe composition of all other plots. The two interior low disturbance plots (LD 1.8,\nLD 3.0) were most similar to each other in composition, and the remaining three\n\nplots (HD 3.0, HD 1.8, LD 1.8) were similar to each other.\n\nForest at the edge (HD 1.0) had previously burned, creating a false edge\nto the forest and a very harsh environment for trees attempting to reestablish.\nFire can drastically alter species composition because only highly specialized\nspecies can tolerate extreme conditions. Recruitment difficulties can be\nexperienced following fire due to the removal of mature trees and all seedlings\nand saplings (Wood, 1989). Recruitment may be further exacerbated by the\n\nremoval of fauna after fire, resulting in a lack of seed dispersal to the area (Webb\n\n38",
    "Page_53": "Chapter 2\n\nand Peart, 2001; Nunes-lturri and Howe, 2007). The water storing capacity of\npeat is altered following fire, causing previously burnt areas to flood and prevent\nre-establishment of vegetation (van Eijk and Lemman, 2004; Wosten et al.,\n2006). With a lack of canopy cover, seedlings which do germinate can be burnt\nby the intense sun (Graham et al., 2007) and are exposed to wind and storms.\nThese factors create a very hostile environment at the brunt edge where only a\nfew species can become established. This is shown by the high abundance of\nonly a few species, with nearly a quarter of the trees represented by a single\nspecies (Section 3.3.1), and explains why regenerating forest composition at the\n\nedge is so dissimilar from secondary forest in logged or drained plots.\n\nSpecies composition of the two interior low disturbance plots (LD 1.8 and\nLD 3.0) were similar to each other and differed most from the edge plot along\nboth the first and second component. This was as expected, as these plots are\nthought to contain mainly primary forest and have similar physical conditions, and\n\nso composition would differ from secondary forest in the other plots.\n\nThe similarity in composition of the two interior high disturbance plots (HD\n1.8 and HD 3.0) was also as expected as both contain high proportions of\nsecondary forest. In both of these plots, colonizing species filled the gaps left by\ntrees which were logged or fell due to drainage resulting in a change of\ncomposition from that of the low disturbance plots. The degree of impact on\nspecies composition by logging depends on the severity and selectiveness.\nSelective logging targets only a few valuable timber species, though non-targeted\n\n39",

More selective logging would result in\nfewer species removed from the community to be replaced by colonizing species.\nWith illegal logging operations, however, once the most valuable species are\nremoved, less valuable species are taken (Commitante et al., 2003), potentially\n\ncausing more dramatic changes in species composition.\n\nAlthough the logged plot (HD 1.8) is similar to the burned plot in that much\nof the forest was removed, recovery has occurred at different rates because of\ndifferent starting points for regeneration (van Eijk and Leeman, 2004). Burning\nnot only removes mature trees but also alters the chemical and physical\ncomposition of peat, removes all seedlings and saplings, and often becomes\nflooded due to a loss of water storage capacity of the peat (van Eijk and\nLemman, 2004; Wosten et al., 2006), and is exposed to intense sun (Graham et\nal., 2007). With logging, not all tees were removed and the peat, seedlings, and\nsaplings were mostly spared, explaining why composition between these plots is\ndifferent. The drained plot had similar species composition to the logged plot.\nAlthough the cause of the loss of trees differs, the result would be similar, with\n\ntrees removed due to falling and the gaps colonized by secondary species.\n\nUnexpectedly, LD 1.4 was most similar in composition to the logged and\ndrained plots, suggesting there may be more secondary forest than was thought.\nThis leads to the proposition that LD 1.4 may not be as undisturbed as was\n\nbelieved (Marchant, 2012; OuTrop, pers. comm.). Due to the close proximity of\n\n40",

If this is the case,\nthen the classification of this plot may be more accurately described as\n\nintermediate disturbance.\n\n2.4.3 Biomass\n\nAboveground biomass ranged from 140 Mg/ha at the high disturbance\nedge plot, to 334 Mg/ha at the low disturbance interior plot. Total vegetation\nbiomass, including aboveground, belowground, course woody debris, and litter\nbiomass, ranged from 208 Mg/ha at the high disturbance edge to 423 Mg/ha at\nthe low disturbance interior plot. Undisturbed mixed swamp forest may, therefore,\n\nhold as much as 251 Mg of carbon per ha contained in the forest vegetation.\n\nThis was the first study to attain complete biomass and carbon values for\nthe Sabangau catchment, as previous studies have looked only at aboveground\nbiomass (Boehm et al., 2011; Kroseder et al., 2012) or peat carbon (Page etal.,\n1999) and did not include belowground, coarse woody debris, or litter biomass\nestimates. Both a high and low estimate of vegetation biomass was attained\nbased on the proportion of litter and coarse woody debris biomass found in other\nforests, but due to the very slow rates of decomposition of dead organic matter in\ntropical peat swamp forest compared to the Brazilian forests from which\nestimates were attained (Brown et al., 1995; Delaney et al., 1997; Chambers et\n\nal., 2004; Rice et al., 2004), true values of dead organic carbon are likely closer\n\n41",

Aboveground biomass estimates were similar. Kroseder\net al. (2012) found using LiDAR that, in unlogged areas of the Sabangau forest,\naboveground biomass was 228 Mg/ha, which is similar to the average of the low\ndisturbance plots though lower (322 Mg/ha). LIDAR allows a larger area to be\ncovered in a shorter amount of time but is more expensive and may not be\naccessible to all researchers. Measuring individual trees to determine biomass is\nmuch more time-consuming and labour-intensive. Based on the pros and cons of\neach method, it is reassuring to confirm that similar results are attained by both\n\nmethods.\n\nThe biomass values for the Sabangau catchment fit well with estimates of\naboveground biomass for other peat swamp forests. Previous estimates for\nundisturbed peat swamp forests fall between 264 and 397 Mg/ha (various\nforests, Verwer and van der Meer, 2010; Lingga Water Catchment, Sarawak,\nWaldes and Page, 2002). Aboveground biomass of peat swamp forest is\ncomparable to Amazonian rainforest estimates, averaging 289 Mg/ha (Slik et al.,\n2010). Compared to other Southeast Asian tropical forests, however, peat\nswamp forest has been reported to have lower aboveground biomass (Kroseder\net al., 2012). Primary lowland dipterocarp forest has been reported to have an\n\naverage aboveground biomass of 457-547 Mg/ha (Slik et al., 2010; Kroseder et\n\n42",

There were clear differences\nin species composition between the edge, high disturbance interior plots, and low\ndisturbance interior plots. As a result, total vegetation biomass of plots, excluding\npeat, tended to increase with distance from the river and decrease as a result of\ndisturbance. High disturbance plots had an average reduction in living biomass of\nmore than 30% compared to low disturbance plots. The lack of statistically\nsignificant effects on the biomass of each plot is likely due to low statistical\n\npower.\n\nEffects of logging on aboveground biomass have been found in other\nstudies of peat swamp forest biomass. Kroseder et al. (2012) found that logged\nforest in Blocks B and C of the Mega Rice Project had biomass values 30% less\nthan that of unlogged areas of the Sabangau catchment. These values were\nmuch lower than was seen at the logged LAHG plot in this study (160 vs. 240\nMg/ha), likely because logging in LAHG has stopped and much regeneration has\noccurred, while logging in the Mega Rice Project likely continues (Sabiham,\n2004). Clearly the reduction in biomass as a result of logging disturbance\n\ndepends on the form, selectivity, intensity, and period of regeneration. Despite\n\n43",

Berry\net al. (2010) found that, following logging, regenerating forest sequestered\ncarbon ata rate five times that of unlogged forest, and aerial sampling over the\nSabangau forest found an increase of tree height up to 2 min four years (Boehm\net al., 2011). Therefore, with conservation status and prevention of further\nlogging, it appears that heavily logged mixed swamp forest can quickly recover\nbiomass. The rate of biomass recovery would, however, slow after the initial\nrecolonization of forest gaps, and some estimates suggest the carbon deficit may\n\npersist for as long as 65 years (Berry et al., 2010).\n\nThe drained plot (HD 3.0) had a 20% reduction in biomass and carbon\ncontent compared to LD 3.0. Assuming the plots were similar before drainage,\nthe loss is likely the result of tree falling due to drainage which has caused the\npeat to lose its integrity. Yamada et al. (2001) suggest that larger and heavier\njuvenile trees may be more likely to fall than smaller and lighter ones and so the\nsame may hold for mature trees, resulting in the loss of the heaviest trees with\n\nthe greatest carbon stores.\n\nIn pristine peat swamp forest, the falling of trees contributes to the\nformation of peat and thus carbon is not lost from the system but rather\nredistributed. With drainage, however, the anaerobic conditions which normally\n\nprevent decomposition are removed and thus carbon is lost from the forest. This\n\n44",

This estimate is slightly higher than that of Page et al.\n(2011) at 74%, possibly because this study considered only mixed swamp forest\n\nwhile Page etal. (2011) considered peat swamp forest in general.\n\nResults of this study suggest that forest biomass can regenerate fairly\nquickly, as was seen in the logged plot (HD 1.8). The destruction of peat,\nhowever, is virtually irreversible. The most important role of the forest, therefore,\nmay be to protect the carbon stored in the peat. Because of the duality of this\necosystem, with reciprocal reliance of the peat and vegetation on each other\n\n(Page etal., 1999), protecting the peat carbon store means protecting the forest.\n\n2.4.3.4 Equation comparisons\n\nEstimations of tree biomass rely on allometric equations which relate tree\nparameters such as diameter and height to mass. The inclusion of tree height\nwhen predicting biomass can improve the accuracy of estimations, but because\nheight is often obscured by the canopy, accurate measurements of tree height\n\nare often difficult to obtain (Chave et al., 2005).

The biomass of trees at heights\ngreater than 25 m was underestimated, while those below 25 m were\n\noverestimated.\n\nThis equation has been used by several other studies to estimate tropical\npeat swamp forest biomass (e.g. Verwer and van der Meer, 2010; Kroseder et\nal., 2012). However, the accuracy of these equations for peat swamp forest has\nnot been investigated. This is critical for assessing the accuracy of biomass and\ncarbon content quantification of tropical peat swamp forest. The equation which\ndoes not include height has within it a conversion factor which estimates height\nbased on the diameter at breast height (Chave et al., 2005). However, this\nconversion is based on other moist tropical forest types, rather than peat swamp\nforest specifically. The differences in peat swamp tree architecture may explain\nwhy such a large discrepancy between the two equations was found, and this\n\nlarge discrepancy suggests peat swamp-specific equations are required.\n\n2.4.3.5 Biomass and Carbon Estimation Limitations\n\nThe largest source of error in biomass calculations likely stem from the\nfact that no allometric equations have yet been developed specifically for tropical\npeat swamp trees, and the proportion of litter and coarse woody debris biomass\n\nto living biomass in peat swamp forest have not been reported.

The\nprevalence of aerial roots is characteristic of peat swamp forest not common in\nother moist tropical forest types from which the allometric equations were\ndeveloped (Verwer and van der Meer, 2010). This would reduce the accuracy of\ncalculations for aboveground biomass. The highly specialized root systems of\npeat swamp forests have likely caused belowground biomass estimates to differ\nfrom the true value. The waterlogged and unstable conditions require an\nextensive and highly intertwined root system to maintain stability in the loose\npeat soil, and trees produce a thick superficial root mat to take advantage of the\nfact that the majority of the nutrients are contained in the thin top layer of peat\n(Richards, 1996). These root specializations likely caused discrepancies in\nbiomass of peat swamp forest roots as a result of different rooting behavior and\ngrowth compared to the roots of Malaysian primary rainforest from which the\nbelowground biomass equation used was developed (Niiyama et al., 2005;\n\nVerwer and van der Meer, 2010).\n\nAlthough the decomposition of dead wood is generally a slow process\n(Palace et al., 2008), the rate of decomposition in tropical peat swamp forest is\nlikely even slower, possibly resulting in greater proportions of coarse woody\ndebris than even the high estimate suggests.

Indirect fire damage can result in higher litterfall by trees due to\nsmoke (Harrison et al., 2007), and so the drained plot (HD 3.0), where much of\nthe surrounding forest has burned, may have experienced greater litterfall than\nplots at the LAHG. However, decomposition of litter at this site may be more\nrapid as a result of a lack of surface water which slows decomposition in pristine\npeat swamp forest. As a result of tree falling, the amount of coarse woody debris\nat HD 3.0 would be increased substantially, even with the higher decomposition\nrate.

Therefore, by\nassessing the traits of the most successful species, knowledge of habitat can be\ngained. The function that a trait confers, however, is environment-specific\n(McIntyre et al., 1999). When physical conditions change, traits which were most\ncommon in previous conditions may no longer be advantageous.

At different peat depths, different adaptive traits may\n\ntherefore be selected for.\n\nTree flora of peat swamp forests is unique in that species must possess\nadaptations to the acidic, nutrient-deficient soil and high, fluctuating water levels\n(Posa etal., 2011). Root systems of peat swamp forest trees must be highly\nspecialized to cope with these difficult peat conditions (Richards, 1996). Because\nthe peat is soft and unstable, many trees develop aerial roots above ground in\nthe form of stilts or buttresses to increase stability (Crook et al., 1997; Yule,\n2010). Increasing the number, size, spread, and height of these aerial roots\npresumably increases tree stability. These traits are therefore expected to be\nmore prevalent in locations which are less stable (Goldsmith and Zahawi, 2007),\n\nas has been reported in past studies (Yule, 2010).\n\nWaterlogging is a particularly difficult characteristic of peat swamp forests\n\nto which plants must adapt.

When trees are removed by\ndisturbance, the species most likely to replace the lost trees are those which\npossess traits allowing them to establish themselves quickly and grow rapidly\n(Finegan, 1984; Swaine and Whitmore, 1988; Sheil and Burslem, 2003).\nPhenology and reproductive traits, such as dispersal method, number of seeds,\nand flowering and fruiting frequency, can influence a species ability to disperse\nand colonize new locations (Wang and Smith, 2002). Canopy shape, tree height,\nand leaf size and shape may influence a species ability to effectively capture\nresources.

Traditional methods of habitat\nquality monitoring to determine whether disturbance has occurred or to assess\nrecovery or degradation of forest following disturbance rely on monitoring species\ncomposition (Harrison, pers. comm.).

Changes in forest structure can therefore greatly influence all other\nspecies. Two flagship ape species present in this forest are the Bornean\norangutan and the southern Bornean agile gibbon, both endangered and\nendemic to Bomeo. The Sabangau forest contains the world’s largest remaining\npopulation of orangutans (Morrough-Bernard et al., 2003) and likely the world’s\nlargest population of southern Bornean agile gibbons (Cheyne et al., 2007).\nThese species rely on the trees for feeding, locomotion, and for orangutans,\nnesting, and so disruptions to forest structure can result in negative impacts on\n\nape communities.\n\n55",
    "Page_70": "Chapter 3\n\nBoth orangutans and gibbons are primarily frugivores (Galdikas, 1988;\nConklin-Brittain et al., 2001). Therefore, tree traits relating to fruit production are\nextremely important for ape communities, including the proportion of trees which\nproduce fruit, size of fruit trees, the regularity and frequency of fruiting, and the\n\nseasonal availability of fruit (Wich et al., 2002; Felton et al., 2003).\n\nCanopy characteristics are important for both species of ape. Gibbons are\nentirely arboreal, performing all aspects of behavior in the canopy, while\norangutans only rarely descend to the ground. Arboreal travel is much more\nenergy efficient for orangutans, and protects them from terrestrial predators.\nBecause fruit is distributed widely throughout the forest, apes have large ranging\npatterns, causing travel efficiency to greatly influence energy budget (Felton et\nal., 2003). Tree traits which may influence primate locomotion include tree\ndiameter (Cheyne et al., 2013) because trees must be large enough to support\nthe animal’s weight, canopy shape which influences canopy continuity and ease\nof travel (Gibson, 2005), and possibly root architecture which may influence\nstability for travel. The height of trees is particularly important for gibbons, who\npreferentially nest, travel, and sing from the tallest trees (Cannon and Leighton,\n1994), showing a significant preference in Sabangau for travelling in trees larger\n\nthan 20 m and avoid using those below 10 m (Cheyne et al., 2013).\n\nIn addition to traits which also influence gibbons, orangutans are affected\nby tree species composition as a result of their need for trees to build nests in. All\n\ngreat apes build nests each night to sleep in (Sugardjito, 1986). Traits of trees\n\n56",
    "Page_71": "Chapter 3\n\nwhich may influence the decision of an orangutan of where to build a nest may\n\ninclude tree size, root system, canopy shape, leaf size, and sap traits.\n\nOrangutans are the largest arboreal primate, with mature females\nweighing an average of 85 pounds, while adult males average nearly 200 pounds\n(Markham and Groves, 1990). Trees in which nests are built must therefore be\nstrong to support their weight overnight, perhaps in wet or windy conditions.\nLarge trees are preferred by orangutans for nesting trees (Gibson, 2005), which\nwould be more likely to withstand their weight. The root system of a tree also\ninfluences orangutan nesting preference (Gibson, 2005) as these traits influence\ntree stability (Crook et al., 1997). Orangutans in Sabangau most often build nests\nin trees with aerial roots, with a particular preference for buttressed trees\ndisproportionate to their abundance in the forest (Gibson, 2005), presumably\nbecause buttresses are stronger than stilted roots (Crook et al., 1997).\nOrangutans seem to avoid nesting in trees with pneumatophores which Gibson\n\n(2005) suggests are less stable.\n\nBecause of the branch breaking involved in nest building, orangutans\navoid nesting in species which produce high volumes of sticky sap so as to avoid\nhaving their fur covered in sap (Gibson, 2005; Malone, 2011). Canopy shape of a\ntree may also influence nest building, as some branching architecture may be\nmore easily manipulated into a platform than others (Gibson, 2005). Orangutans\nare known to occasionally use bundles of leaves like blankets or pillows, and use\nleaves as umbrellas within the nest during rain (MacKinnon, 1974; van Schaik,\n2003). Orangutans may therefore prefer to nest in trees which produce large\n\n57",

Some species of leaves are clearly preferable for nest\nbuilding, as evidenced by the development of the habit of ‘leaf carrying’ in some\npopulations of orangutans, wherein particularly good branches will be carried\nthroughout the day until choosing a tree to build their nest in (Russon et al.,\n2007). Alterations in these tree traits could influence orangutan nesting\n\nbehaviour.\n\nBecause changes in the prevalence and values of these tree traits may\ninfluence behavior and ecology of ape communities, the changes in these traits\nas a result of natural variations in peat depth and anthropogenic variations in\ndisturbance regime were investigated in order to further the understanding of\n\norangutan and gibbon ecology and aid in their conservation.\n\n3.1.3 Identification traits\n\nThe high diversity of tropical forest trees makes identification of species\ndifficult, often resulting in the reliance on a few experts in the field. Furthermore,\nmany peat swamp forest species have not yet been fully scientifically described\nand identification guides are lacking (Graham et al., 2007). Measurements of\ndistinguishing traits were therefore collected which would aid in future species\n\nidentification and provide more complete descriptions of these species of trees.\n\nTraits which can help in identification include bark texture, cambium\ncolour, Sap presence, Sap flow rate, and sap colour. These traits are not believed\nto have strong effects on a species ability to cope with physical conditions, but\nare easily recognized and often distinctive. Distinct canopy shape and leaf traits\n\n58",

The measurements of\n\nthese traits were therefore also included in this study.\n\n3.1.4 Species Traits Research Goals\n\nAdaptive tree traits were measured to assess how natural changes in peat\ndepth and anthropogenic changes in level of disturbance alter traits of the most\nsuccessful tree species in order to increase the understanding of the ecology of\ntropical peat swamp forest trees and develop a method of trait-based habitat\nquality monitoring to improve and simplify monitoring of peat swamp forest.\nChanges in tree traits influence species which rely upon the trees, and so\npossible impacts of the alterations in tree traits on communities of orangutans\nand gibbons were explored to better understand their response to natural and\nman-made changes in the forest to aid in their conservation. Finally, to assist in\nfuture research conducted at LAHG, easily identifiable traits of trees were\ncollected to assist in future tree identification and lessen the need for expert\n\nknowledge.\n\n3.1.5 Species Traits Predictions\n3.1.5.1 Adaptive Trait Predictions\n\nAt least some adaptive traits were expected to be influenced by distance\nfrom the river and disturbance. Because adaptive traits were thought to influence\na Species ability to cope with its environment, and changes in peat depth and\ndisturbance alter physical conditions, these were expected to lead to changes in\nthe prevalence of certain traits.\n\n59",
    "Page_74": "Chapter 3\n\nTraits expected to be influenced by distance from the river and thus peat\ndepth were root traits, including proportion of trees with aerial roots and rootlets,\nand the number, height, spread, and circumference of aerial roots. It was\npredicted that the value of these traits would increase with distance from the river\n\nas the result of greater instability associated with deeper peat layers.\n\nTraits expected to be influenced by disturbance included size traits,\nincluding diameter, basal area, and height. These were expected to be reduced\nas a result of disturbance due to the removal of larger trees and replacement by\n\nyoung trees.\n\n3.1.5.2 Primate Trait Predictions\n\nIt was unsure how primate traits may be affected by river distance or\ndisturbance. However, many tree traits which influence use by orangutans and\ngibbons are also those which influence the adaptive ability of trees, such as root,\nsize, phenology, and reproductive traits. Therefore, any change in these traits as\n\na result of disturbance or peat depth will influence the primates which use them.\n\n3.1.5.3. Identification Trait Predictions\n\nNo effects of distance or disturbance were expected from most\nidentification traits, such as bark and sap traits, as these were not thought to\n\nhave a strong influence on the success of a species.\n\n60",

Due to low abundances of some trees, measured\ntrees were not necessarily located in the plot in which they were dominant, but\nthese were taken to be representative of the species and largely unaffected by\nlocation. Twenty-seven traits were measured for each tree. Each trait fell into 8\ngeneral types: roots (7 traits), size (3 traits), bark (3 traits), leaves (4 traits), sap\n(4 traits), and growth (2 traits). Additional traits relating phenology (2 traits), and\nreproduction (2 traits) were compiled from data collected previously by OuTrop\n(unpublished) and Harrison (2009). Each trait was categorized as an adaptive\ntrait (A), meaning a trait which influences tree survival, primate use trait (P),\nmeaning a trait which influences primate behaviour or ecology, or identification\ntrait (I) which aid in tree species identification.

Tree traits influenced by changes in peat depth as\ndistance from the river increases were investigated to better understand tropical\npeat swamp forest ecology, and changes as a result of disturbance were\ninvestigated to better understand how the forest adapts in response and to\n\ndevelop a trait-based monitoring system.\n\nNo adaptive traits were significantly affected by distance. It was expected\nthat root traits would increase with distance from the river and peat depth but this\nwas not observed, possibly due to low statistical power. As distance from the\nriver increases, the peat depth and thus instability increases, putting greater\nselection pressure for traits such as aerial roots which would enhance stability\n(Goldsmith and Zahawi, 2007; Yule 2010). The only traits significantly influenced\nby distance from the river were sap traits, with the proportion of trees which\nproduced sap and the flow rate of sap increasing with distance. These results\nwere not expected, as sap traits are not thought to contribute substantially to a\nspecies ability to colonize new locations, face competitors, or cope with physical\n\nconditions.\n\n80",
    "Page_95": "Chapter 3\n\nThe principal components analysis showed clear divisions between plots\naccording to disturbance, with both components showing a clear progression\nfrom plots with the lowest severity of disturbance (LD 3.0 and LD 1.8) to the\ngreatest (HD 1.0). Analyses of individual traits showed similar patterns, with\neffects of disturbance on root traits, fruit production, and leaf shape. Disturbance\n\ntherefore alters physical conditions, causing different species traits to dominate.\n\n3.4.2.2 Traits Influenced by Disturbance: Trait-Based Habitat Quality\nmonitoring\n\nThe development of a trait-based monitoring system requires identification\nof species traits indicative of disturbed or pristine conditions which are easily\nrecognized and easily sampled, with clear distinction in this trait between high\nand low disturbance areas. Traits which appeared to be affected by disturbance\nincluded root traits, size traits, sap production and flow rate, leaf shape, and the\nproportion of trees which produce fruit. However, not all of these traits are\n\nsuitable for trait-based monitoring.\n\nSize measurements (diameter at breast height, basal diameter, height) for\nthe dominant species in each plot followed the trend of decreasing with\ndisturbance, similar to the whole plots (Section 2.3.1). This was as expected as\nhigh disturbance plots would have a greater proportion of younger, smaller trees\n(Marchant, 2012). However, the monitoring of size traits to assess disturbance\nwould require measurement of all trees. This would be time-consuming,\n\nparticularly for tree height, and the distinction between high and low disturbance\n\n81",
    "Page_96": "Chapter 3\n\nplots is not clear. Size measurements are therefore not optimal traits for trait-\n\nbased monitoring.\n\nHigh disturbance plots had significantly rounder leaves than low\ndisturbance plots. Size and shape influence leaf function through energy\nbalance, gas exchange, and supply and support of leaf tissue, and therefore\noptimum leaf shape likely varies according to environment (Winn, 1999). Leaf\nshape, however, is difficult to assess from the ground, and removing leaves from\nthe canopy is extremely difficult (pers. obs.). The distinction between a leaf that is\nround and one which is not would be subjective and arbitrary unless measuring.\nLeaf shape monitoring is therefore not a suitable method for assessing\n\ndisturbance.\n\nThe proportion of trees which produce fruit was significantly decreased in\ndisturbed plots. Species rely on various dispersal vectors for spreading seeds.\nAnimal ingestion of fruit bearing seeds is a common method of seed dispersal\n(Richards, 1996; Webb and Peart, 2001). Species which do not produce fruit\nmust rely on other dispersal methods such as wind (Webb and Peart, 2001).\nPrimates, gibbons in particular, are among the most important seed dispersers in\nthe forests they are found (McConkey and Chivers, 2006). If animals are driven\nfrom a location as a result of disturbance (MacKinnon, 1974; Felton et al., 2003),\nthere may be reduced establishment of fruit-bearing trees as a result of the lack\nof dispersal vectors, leading to a higher proportion of trees which disperse by\nother methods and thus do not produce fleshy fruit (Webb and Peart, 2001). This\n\n82",
    "Page_97": "Chapter 3\n\nmay explain why disturbed plots had a lower proportion of animal dispersed fruit-\nbearing trees. For example, the removal of large seed-dispersing primates due to\nbushmeat hunting in the Amazon resulted in reduced recruitment of particular\ntree species, even in the lack of any other form of disturbance (Nunes-lIturri and\nHowe, 2007). Monitoring the proportion of trees which produce fruit, however,\nwould not be a suitable method of trait-based monitoring because fruit is only\nproduced at certain times of the year (OuTrop, unpublished), and only once a\n\ntree has reached maturity (Dawson et al., 2001).\n\nSap traits were not expected to be influenced by peat depth or disturbance\nas these were collected as primate and identification traits. However, the\nproportion of trees that produce sap and the rate of sap flow were significantly\ndecreased with disturbance. Incorporating sap monitoring into trait-based\nsurveying would require cutting each tree and recording sap presence and flow\nrate. This would be time-consuming and, therefore, sap traits are not suitable for\ntrait-based monitoring. In addition, because some species produce an irritating\nsap, some degree of species identification would be required to avoid discomfort\n\nduring sampling.\n\nDisturbance significantly reduced the spread and height of aerial roots,\nand may have resulted in a decrease in the proportion of trees with aerial roots\nand the number of aerial roots per tree. Aerial roots are an adaptation to the\nunstable soil (Richards, 1996), an issue which may be particularly salient for\n\nclimax species which may persist for a long time (Swaine and Whitmore, 1988).\n\n83",
    "Page_98": "Chapter 3\n\nColonizing species are expected to invest more in rapid establishment and\ngrowth than traits which would allow long-term persistence (Swaine and\nWhitmore, 1988), possibly explaining why secondary forest in high disturbance\nplots had a lower prevalence and size of aerial roots compared to low\ndisturbance plots. Aerial root sampling could be incorporated into monitoring\nprograms as they are easy to identify, though because aerial roots were present\nin disturbed locations and may require measurements of size and number, this\n\ncould be time-consuming.\n\nPneumatophores were common in both interior low disturbance plots (LD\n1.8 and LD 3.0), exhibited by approximately a third of the dominant trees, and\nabsent from all other plots. A high prevalence and commonness of\npneumatophores may, therefore, be indicative of interior mixed swamp forest\nwhich has experienced low levels of disturbance. There was not a statistically\nsignificant effect of disturbance on pneumatophores since pneumatophores were\nnot present in LD 1.4. This may support the proposition that LD 1.4 may be better\ncharacterized as having experienced an intermediate level of disturbance\n\n(Section 2.4.3).\n\nPneumatophores are adaptations to the swampy conditions characteristic\nof pristine peat swamp forests (Wosten et al., 2006). Hydrological conditions\neasily become disrupted by disturbance (Wosten et al., 2006), such that this trait\nmay no longer be selected for in highly disturbed areas.

Like aerial roots,\npneumatophores may be costly structures which species that put all resources\ninto rapid growth would likely lack. Pneumatophores appear to only be a trait of\nclimax community in this forest. The lack of pneumatophores at the drained plot\n(HD 3.0) may be the result of a bias toward the felling of species with this trait.\nGibson (2005) suggested that trees with pneumatophores may be less stable\n\nthan trees without, though it is unclear why this may be.\n\nPneumatophores are easily recognized so little training would be required\nto monitor this trait, and trees would not need to be manipulated or anything\nremoved for sampling. A single tree can produce numerous pneumatophores and\ncan be present at considerable distances from the trunk (pers. obs.) and so,\nwhen present, pneumatophores may be fairly abundant. These characteristics\nmake pneumatophores a good trait to incorporate into monitoring programs. If\nthis trait is only found only in climax communities in low disturbance conditions,\nsurveying of species composition to determine whether disturbance has occurred\nwould be unnecessary as the simple survey of whether pneumatophores are\ncommon may yield similar results. An area of mixed swamp forest which does\nnot have abundant pneumatophores may indicate the area has experienced\ndisturbance and is comprised of secondary forest. An increase in the prevalence\n\nof this trait over time may suggest the area is recovering.\n\n85",

Primate Traits\n\nOrangutans and gibbons in the Sabangau catchment rely on the trees for\nnearly all aspects of life, including feeding, travel, and sleeping. Several studies\nhave found decreased densities and altered behavior of orangutans (MacKinnon,\n1974; Rao and van Shaik, 1997; Felton et al., 2003; Morrough-Bernard et al.,\n2003) and gibbons (Nijman, 2001; Cheyne et al., 2013) as a result of\ndisturbance. This study aimed to identify the precise mechanisms of this by\ninvestigating changes in tree traits which influence primate use. A principal\ncomponents analysis of primate traits showed a clear distinction between the\nhigh disturbance plots and the interior low disturbance interior plots, with LD 1.4\n\nintermediary. The first component, contributed to most by root traits, fruit\n\n86",
    "Page_101": "Chapter 3\n\nproduction, and sap flow, showed a clear progression with severity of\ndisturbance. The second component, which included fruiting regularity, sap\nproduction and stickiness, and tree diameter and height, showed a distinction\nbetween the high disturbance and low disturbance plots. Any change in the\nprevalence or value of traits used by these primates will results in changes in\n\ntheir behavior which may have negative consequences.\n\n3.4.3.1 Feeding Traits\n\nFruiting traits are of critical importance to both orangutans and gibbons, as\nfruit comprises the majority of their diets (Galdikas, 1988; Conklin-Brittain et al.,\n2001). Food availability is correlated with gibbon (Hamard et al., 2010) and\norangutan (Felton et al., 2003) densities. In a principal components analysis,\nfruiting traits showed a progression relating to disturbance severity, showing that\nthe proportion of trees which produce fruit and the regularity and frequency of\nfruiting is influenced by anthropogenic disturbance. General linear models\nshowed that the proportion of dominant trees which produce fruit was decreased\nin high disturbance plots. This is similar to findings by Felton et al. (2003).\nFurthermore, the average size of trees in high disturbance plots was decreased,\nand so, because crop yield of a tree is correlated with diameter with larger trees\nproducing more fruit (Chapman et al., 1992), trees in high disturbance plots\nwhich do produce fruit may produce a smaller amount. Orangutans maximize\nforaging efficiency by showing a preference of foraging in the largest fruit trees\n(Felton et al., 2003), with a strong preference for trees above 50 cm diameter at\nbreast height found in one study (Wich et al., 2002). Gibbons show a similar\n\n87",
    "Page_102": "Chapter 3\n\npreference for large fruit tees (Cheyne et al., 2013), yet this is the category of\ntrees decreased by logging and drainage and absent from the edge (Section\n2.3.2; Marchant, 2012). Furthermore, trees may take many years to mature and\nbe able to produce fruit (Dawson et al., 2001), and so the change in age structure\nresulting in the removal of mature trees and replacement by immature trees may\nalso decrease fruit availability. Decreases in food availability may result in\nincreases in home range size and subsequent decreases in density (Singleton\n\nand van Schaik, 2001).\n\nThe regularity and frequency of fruiting may also be altered as a result of\ndisturbance. Tree species were categorized as fruiting regularly on a predictable\nschedule, frequently but not predictably, or irregularly and infrequently (OuTrop,\nunpublished). Fruiting frequency is important as trees which produce fruit\nfrequently will have fruit available more often throughout the year, while regularity\nis important because it allows apes to predict when fruit will be available (Vasey,\n1991), thus maximizing foraging efficiency. Because trees which are currently\nfruiting can be widely distributed, searching the forest for fruit without prior\nknowledge of where fruit may be is an inefficient strategy, especially because this\nconstantly changes throughout the year. Orangutans and other great apes are\nknown to produce mental maps of the forest, capable of not only remembering\nwhere specific fruit trees are, but also when they fruit and the most efficient route\nto them (Vasey, 1991). This, however, is only possible if the tree fruits regularly\nor frequently. Disturbed plots had an increased proportion of trees which fruited\n\nirregularly. For these trees, it would not be known when they fruit without\n\n88",
    "Page_103": "Chapter 3\n\nchecking, which is highly inefficient. It is conceivable that gibbons produce\n\nmental maps in a similar fashion. Without this capability, the apes would be in\ndanger of expending too much energy while searching for food (Vasey, 1991).\nTogether these trait changes suggest that apes may be negatively affected by\n\ndisturbance as a result of the reduction in fruit availability and predictability.\n\n3.4.3.2 Size traits\n\nPlot averages for tree height and diameter of dominant trees tended to\ndecrease with disturbance. Similar trends were observed for average diameter of\nall trees in the plot (Section 2.3.1). Gibbons are particularly influenced by\nreductions in height of trees due to their preference of singing (Whitten, 1982;\nReichard, 1998), sleeping (Reichard, 1998), and travelling (Cannon and\n\nLeighton, 1994; Cheyne et al., 2013) in the tallest trees.\n\nGibbons are monogamous territorial apes, living in small family groups\nwhich sing at dawn to delineate and defend their territory (Whitten, 1982), often\ninvolving counter-singing between groups. Home range sizes are large\n(Singleton & van Schaik, 2001), and so gibbon songs must be loud to be heard\nby other groups, and may be heard from more than a kilometer away (Whitten,\n1982). Height above the ground increases long-distance sound transmission in\nforest, and so the tallest trees, typically emergents, are selected for singing\n\n(Whitten, 1982; Reichard, 1998). A reduction in the height of trees may reduce\n\n89",
    "Page_104": "Chapter 3\n\nsound transmission and result in increased inter-group conflict due to a lack of\n\neffective communication between groups.\n\nGibbons, particularly females with infants and juveniles, sleep in the\nlargest available trees, presumably as an anti-predator adaptation (Reichard,\n1998). Reichard (1998) found gibbons mostly slept in trees above 25 m,\naveraging 32 m, with individuals in the tree mostly above 20 m. The reduction in\ntree height observed in this study as a result of disturbance may therefore\n\nincrease detection of gibbons by predators while sleeping.\n\nGibbons prefer to travel through trees greater than 21 m in height at\nSabangau, possibly because larger trees are more likely to have a continuous\ncanopy (Cheyne et al., 2013). Canopy continuity affects orangutans as well\n(Felton et al., 2003). Travel requires a considerable amount of energy, and so\ngibbons and orangutans have evolved to travel in the most energetically-efficient\nway through the canopy (Cannon and Leighton, 1994; Felton et al., 2003;\nCheyne et al., 2013). Canopy discontinuity from decreased tree size or fallen\ntrees can disrupt travel efficiency. When confronted with a gap in the canopy,\norangutans and gibbons must either travel a longer distance to go around the\ngap (Cheyne et al., 2013), or orangutans may descend to travel on ground\n(Felton et al., 2003). More energy must be spent to traverse a forest with more\ncanopy gaps than if it were continuous, and there may also be an increased risk\nof falling (Felton et al., 2003). Greater energy demands of locomotion have been\n\nfound in orangutans in disturbed Sumatran forests (Rao and van Shaik, 1997),\n\n90",
    "Page_105": "Chapter 3\n\nand selective logging has been shown to have altered gibbon locomotion in\nSabangau (Cheyne et al., 2013). The reduction in tree size as a result of\n\ndisturbance may, therefore, result in greater energy expenditure during travel.\n\n3.4.3.3 Orangutan Nesting Traits\n\nOrangutans build nests for sleeping, building a new nest each night\n(Sugardjito, 1986). Orangutans prefer to nest in buttressed trees, though also\noften nest in stilted trees (Gibson, 2005). The decrease in the proportion of trees\nwith aerial roots and size of aerial roots in high disturbance plots may result in\nthere being fewer suitable nesting trees at disturbed sites. This, coupled with the\nreduced average size of trees, may make trees less stable and able to support\norangutan weight. If strong trees are not available, orangutans may tie together\nseveral trees when building nests (Gibson, 2005). This change in behaviour may\nrequire more energy and time than building a platform from a single tree,\nincreasing energy demands and decreasing time available for foraging. If the\navailability of nesting trees is reduced, they may also be more likely to reuse\nnesting trees, which could increase parasite loads (Reichard, 1998). This was\nobserved in the Mega Rice Project where multiple orangutan nests were\n\nobserved in a single tree (pers. obs.).\n\nUnlike gibbons which prefer to sleep in the tallest trees, orangutans of\ndifferent sex and age classes in Sabangau use different heights for sleeping,\npresumably as a result of differential vulnerability to predators and conspecifics\n\n(Sugardito, 1986; Gibson, 2005). Orangutans also prefer different diameters and\n\n91",
    "Page_106": "Chapter 3\n\ncanopy shape for nesting trees according to sex and age (Gibson, 2005).\nSubordinate individuals in the population, females and adolescents, prefer larger\nand taller trees (Gibson, 2005). This suggests that perhaps a high degree of\ndiversity in tree species may be preferable so that orangutans of all age and sex\n\ncan exhibit their preferences.\n\nOrangutans avoid nesting in trees which produce sap to avoid getting it on\ntheir fur, almost never nesting in trees that produce sap (Gibson, 2005; Malone,\n2012). This study found that the proportion of trees producing sap and the flow\nrate of sap was significantly decreased by disturbance, so this may mitigate the\n\nchanges in tree size and stability.\n\nAside from the changes in sap traits, all changes in primate traits as a\nresult of disturbance would have negative consequences, possibly providing the\nmechanism by which disturbance in tropical peat swamp forests leads to\n\nreductions in densities of orangutans and gibbons.\n\n3.4.4 Identification Traits\n\nComplete descriptions of the traits of the 23 most abundant tree species in\nthe Sabangau catchment mixed swamp forest were collected, including traits\nwhich can be easily recognized and used to distinguish species. There were no\ntrends in most traits measured for the purpose of helping in future identification,\nas was expected as these are not thought to influence a species adaptability or\n\ncompetitive ability, aside from sap traits as discussed previously.

These species were taken to be representative of the entire\nplot, though this may not necessarily be the case. This is not believed to be\nproblematic for adaptive traits since the most successful species should be those\nbest suited to conditions of that location, but may be a source of error for primate\ntraits, as rare species may have disproportionately large impacts on primate use.\nThe sampled fruit traits may not be representative of the plot as a rare species\nmay comprise a large portion of orangutan and gibbon diet, and the dominant\nspecies may not be a preferred food. Species which were dispersed by animals\nwere assumed to have comprised part of the ape’s diet, though this may not be\nthe case as these species may be dispersed by methods other than ingesting\nseeds in fruit and may be dispersed by animals other than orangutans or\ngibbons. Future work could focus on those tree species known to be favored food\nitems for orangutans and gibbons and assess how the distribution and\nabundance of these changes in different areas of the forest and according to\n\ndisturbance.\n\nThe sampled trees were not necessarily in the plot for which they were\ntaken to be representative of. The sampled traits were assumed to be\n\nrepresentative of the species and therefore not greatly influenced by location,\n\n93",
    "Page_108": "Chapter 3\n\nthough this may not be the case for all traits. Most categorical traits, such as sap\npresence or root type, should be consistent regardless of location. Quantitative\ntraits, however, such as height or number of roots, may be more sensitive to\nlocation, and so the trees measured for that trait may not perfectly reflect the true\nvalue for that plot. However, a species which produces, for example, many aerial\nroots is expected to do so in different locations, though the exact number may\ndiffer. In future it would be ideal to collect tree traits from the plot in which they\nare meant to represent, which would allow comparisons of traits of the same\n\nspecies in different locations to be compared.\n\n3.4.6 Conclusion\n\nThe traits of the most abundant species of trees in different areas of the\nforest were influenced by disturbance, though most were not significantly\naffected by distance from the river. Changes in traits included both adaptive traits\nand traits which influence primate use. The best trait to incorporate into trait-\nbased monitoring appears to be a high prevalence of pneumatophores to indicate\npristine conditions. This trait is easy to recognize, often abundant when present,\nand would be fast and simple to survey. Further research in other peat swamp\nforests is required to confirm whether pneumatophores are indicative of pristine\nconditions. Locations that were highly disturbed had alterations in tree traits\nwhich influence primate use, including fruiting patterns, tree size, and root and\nsap traits, which would likely cause changes in feeding, locomotion, and sleeping\n\nbehavior of orangutans and gibbons in disturbed forest.

Furthermore, forest\ndegradation can have negative impacts on orangutans and gibbons, two\nendangered and endemic flagship ape species, through the alteration of tree\ntraits they rely on, and would likely have similar effects on other faunal species\nas well. The protection of these forests should therefore be a priority to preserve\nthe carbon store and biodiversity they contain. Monitoring programs of peat\nswamp forest habitat quality may incorporate surveying of pneumatophore\nprevalence to indicate areas of low disturbance, which would greatly decrease\n\nthe money, time, and expertise required for peat swamp monitoring.\n\n4.2 Limitations\n\nThe greatest limitation of this study was that only six tree plots were used.\nPlots at an equal distance from the river were assumed to have been similar prior\nto disturbance, but due to small-scale variations in nutrient levels, peat chemistry,\ndepth, and hydrology (Page et al., 1999) this may not be the case. Studies which\nused replicate plots in Bornean dipterocarp forest found that species composition\n\nvaried between plots before disturbance (Verburg and van Eijk-Bos, 2003), and\n\n96",
    "Page_111": "Chapter 4\n\nso itis likely that pre-disturbance variations existed in plots in Sabangau as well.\nPre-existing differences may have been incorrectly inferred to be a result of\ndifferent peat depth or disturbance. For example, the lack of pneumatophores at\nHD 3.0 was assumed to be a result of a loss of species with this structure as a\nresult of disturbance, though it is possible pneumatophores were absent from this\n\nlocation before disturbance.\n\nDifferent forms of disturbance are likely to have different effects. Therefore\nit would have been optimal to have looked at logging, drainage, and burning\n\nseparately to uncover the unique effects of each.\n\n4.3 Significance\n\nThis was the first study to attain total biomass and carbon estimates for\nthe Sabangau catchment mixed swamp forest, including carbon from\naboveground, belowground, coarse woody debris, litter, and peat biomass. The\nestimates for low and high disturbance areas will allow more precise predictions\nof how the degradation of these forests translates into greenhouse gas emissions\nand aid in improvement of peatland management and carbon budgeting\n\ninitiatives such as REDD (Page etal., 2011).\n\nTo my knowledge, this was the first study to explore the use of tree traits\nas a proxy of habitat quality in tropical rainforests. Trait-based monitoring will\nincrease the efficiency and ease and decrease the cost of habitat quality\n\nmonitoring in peat swamp forest, in comparison to species-focused monitoring\n\n97",
