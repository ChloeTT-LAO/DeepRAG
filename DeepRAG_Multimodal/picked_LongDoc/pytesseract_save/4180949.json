Extensive register- based\npower control is included, enabling stereo 48-kHz DAC playback as low as 14 mW from a 3.3-V analog supply,\nmaking it ideal for portable, battery-powered audio and telephony applications.\n\nThe record path of the TLV320AIC32 contains integrated microphone bias, digitally-controlled stereo-microphone\npre-amp, and automatic gain control (AGC), with mix/mux capability among the multiple analog inputs. The\nplayback path includes mix/mux capability from the stereo DAC and selected inputs, through programmable\nvolume controls, to the various outputs.\n\nThe TLV320AIC32 contains four high-power output drivers as well as two fully differential output drivers. The\nhigh-power output drivers are capable of driving a variety of load configurations, including up to four channels of\nsingle-ended 16-Q headphones using ac-coupling capacitors, or stereo 16-Q headphones in a cap-less output\nconfiguration. In addition, pairs of drivers can be used to drive 8-Q speakers in a BTL configuration at 500 mW\nper channel.\n\nThe stereo audio DAC supports sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz and includes programmable digital filtering\nin the DAC path for 3D, bass, treble, midrange effects, speaker equalization, and de-emphasis for 32 kHz, 44.1\nkHz, and 48 kHz rates. The stereo-audio ADC supports sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz and is preceded by\nprogrammable gain amplifiers providing up to +59.5 dB analog gain for low-level microphone inputs.\n\nThe serial control bus supports the I?C protocol, while the serial-audio data bus is programmable for I’S, left/right\njustified, DSP, or TDM modes. A highly programmable PLL is included for flexible clock generation and support\nfor all standard audio rates from a wide range of available MCLKs, varying from 512 kHz to 50 MHz, with special\nattention paid to the most popular cases of 12 MHz, 13 MHz, 16 MHz, 19.2 MHz, and 19.68 MHz system clocks.\n\nThe TLV320AIC32 operates from an analog supply of 2.7 V - 3.6 V, a digital core supply of 1.65 V - 1.95 V, and\na digital I/O supply of 1.1 V - 3.6 V. The device is available ina 5 x5 mm, 32-lead QFN package.\n\ni Please be aware that an important notice concerning availability, standard warranty, and use in critical applications of Texas\nInstruments semiconductor products and disclaimers thereto appears at the end of this data sheet.\n\nPRODUCTION DATA information is current as of publication date. i 7\nProducts conform to specifications per the terms of the Texas Copyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nInstruments standard warranty.

After all power supplies are at\ntheir specified values, the RESET pin must be driven low for at least 10 ns. If this reset sequence is not\nperformed, the 'AIC32 may not respond properly to register reads/writes.\n\n \n\nDIGITAL CONTROL SERIAL INTERFACE\n\nThe register map of the TLV320AIC 32 actually consists of multiple pages of registers, with each page containing\n128 registers. The register at address zero on each page is used as a page-control register, and writing to this\nregister determines the active page for the device. All subsequent read/write operations will access the page that\nis active at the time, unless a register write is performed to change the active page. Only two pages of registers\nare implemented in this product, with the active page defaulting to page 0 upon device reset.\n\nFor example, at device reset, the active page defaults to page 0, and thus all register read/write operations for\naddresses 1 to 127 will access registers in page 0. If registers on page 1 must be accessed, the user must write\nthe 8-bit sequence 0x01 to register 0, the page control register, to change the active page from page 0 to page 1.\nAfter this write, it is recommended the user also read back the page control register, to safely ensure the change\nin page control has occurred properly. Future read/write operations to addresses 1 to 127 will now access\nregisters in page 1. When page 0 registers must be accessed again, the user writes the 8-bit sequence 0x00 to\nregister 0, the page control register, to change the active page back to page 0. After a recommended read of the\npage control register, all further read/write operations to addresses 1 to 127 will now access page 0 registers\nagain.\n\nPC CONTROL INTERFACE\n\nThe TLV320AIC32 supports the I2C control protocol using 7-bit addressing and is capable of both standard and\nfast modes. For I?C fast mode, note that the minimum timing for each of tHD-STA, tSU-STA, and tSU-STO is 2.0\nus, as seen in Figure 17. The TLV320AIC32 will respond to the I?C address of 0011000. 12C is a two-wire,\nopen-drain interface supporting multiple devices and masters on a single bus. Devices on the I?C bus only drive\nthe bus lines LOW by connecting them to ground; they never drive the bus lines HIGH. Instead, the bus wires\nare pulled HIGH by pull-up resistors, so the bus wires are HIGH when no device is driving them LOW. This way,\ntwo devices cannot conflict; if two devices drive the bus simultaneously, there is no driver contention.\n\n18 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

Both masters and slaves can read and write, but slaves can only do so under the direction of\nthe master. Some I?C devices can act as masters or slaves, but the TLV320AIC32 can only act as a slave\ndevice.\n\nAn [°C bus consists of two lines, SDA and SCL. SDA carries data; SCL provides the clock. All data is transmitted\nacross the I?C bus in groups of eight bits. To send a bit on the I?C bus, the SDA line is driven to the appropriate\nlevel while SCL is LOW (a LOW on SDA indicates the bit is zero; a HIGH indicates the bit is one). Once the SDA\nline has settled, the SCL line is brought HIGH, then LOW. This pulse on SCL clocks the SDA bit into the\nreceivers shift register.\n\nThe I°C bus is bidirectional: the SDA line is used both for transmitting and receiving data. When a master reads\nfrom a slave, the slave drives the data line; when a master sends to a slave, the master drives the data line.\nUnder normal circumstances the master drives the clock line.\n\nMost of the time the bus is idle, no communication is taking place, and both lines are HIGH. When\ncommunication is taking place, the bus is active. Only master devices can start a communication. They do this by\ncausing a START condition on the bus. Normally, the data line is only allowed to change state while the clock\nline is LOW. If the data line changes state while the clock line is HIGH, it is either a START condition or its\ncounterpart, a STOP condition. A START condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from\nHIGH to LOW. A STOP condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from LOW to HIGH.\n\nAfter the master issues a START condition, it sends a byte that indicates which slave device it wants to\ncommunicate with. This byte is called the address byte. Each device on an I?C bus has a unique 7-bit address to\nwhich it responds. (Slaves can also have 10-bit addresses; see the I?C specification for details.) The master\nsends an address in the address byte, together with a bit that indicates whether it wishes to read from or write to\nthe slave device.\n\nEvery byte transmitted on the IC bus, whether it is address or data, is acknowledged with an acknowledge bit.\nWhen a master has finished sending a byte (eight data bits) to a slave, it stops driving SDA and waits for the\nslave to acknowledge the byte. The slave acknowledges the byte by pulling SDA LOW. The master then sends a\nclock pulse to clock the acknowledge bit. Similarly, when a master has finished reading a byte, it pulls SDA LOW\nto acknowledge this to the slave. It then sends a clock pulse to clock the bit.\n\nA not-acknowledge is performed by simply leaving SDA HIGH during an acknowledge cycle. If a device is not\npresent on the bus, and the master attempts to address it, it will receive a not-acknowledge because no device\nis present at that address to pull the line LOW.\n\nWhen a master has finished communicating with a slave, it may issue a STOP condition. When a STOP\ncondition is issued, the bus becomes idle again. A master may also issue another START condition. When a\nSTART condition is issued while the bus is active, it is called a repeated START condition.\n\nCopyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

So in the next eight clocks, the data on SDA is treated as data for the next incremental\nregister.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of an I?C register read, after the device has sent out the 8-bit data from the addressed\nregister, if the master issues a ACKNOWLEDGE, the slave takes over control of SDA bus and transmit for the\nnext 8 clocks the data of the next incremental register.\n\nDIGITAL AUDIO DATA SERIAL INTERFACE\n\nAudio data is transferred between the host processor and the TLV320AIC32 via the digital audio data serial\ninterface, or audio bus. The audio bus of the TLV320AIC 32 can be configured for left or right justified, 12S, DSP,\nor TDM modes of operation, where communication with standard telephony PCM interfaces is supported within\nthe TDM mode. These modes are all MSB-first, with data width programmable as 16, 20, 24, or 32 bits. In\naddition, the word clock (WCLK) and bit clock (BCLK) can be independently configured in either Master or Slave\nmode, for flexible connectivity to a wide variety of processors\n\nThe word clock (WCLK) is used to define the beginning of a frame, and may be programmed as either a pulse or\na square-wave signal. The frequency of this clock corresponds to the maximum of the selected ADC and DAC\nsampling frequencies.\n\nThe bit clock (BCLK) is used to clock in and out the digital audio data across the serial bus. When in Master\nmode, this signal can be programmed in two further modes: continuous transfer mode, and 256-clock mode. In\ncontinuous transfer mode, only the minimal number of bit clocks needed to transfer the audio data are generated,\nso in general the number of bit clocks per frame will be two times the data width. For example, if data width is\nchosen as 16-bits, then 32 bit clocks will be generated per frame. If the bit clock signal in master mode will be\nused by a PLL in another device, it is recommended that the 16-bit or 32-bit data width selections be used.\nThese cases result in a low jitter bit clock signal being generated, having frequencies of 32xFs or 64xFs. In the\ncases of 20-bit and 24-bt data width in master mode, the bit clocks generated in each frame will not all be of\nequal period, due to the device not having a clean 40xFs or 48xFs clock signal readily available. The average\nfrequency of the bit clock signal is still accurate in these cases (being 40xFs or 48xFs), but the resulting clock\nsignal has higher jitter than in the 16-bit and 32-bit cases.\n\n20 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

DSP Serial Bus Mode Operation\n\nTDM DATA TRANSFER\n\nTime-division multiplexed data transfer can be realized in any of the above transfer modes if the 256-clock bit\nclock mode is selected, although it is recommended to be used in either left-justified mode or DSP mode. By\nchanging the programmable offset, the bit clock in each frame where the data begins can be changed, and the\nserial data output driver (DOUT) can also be programmed to tri-state during all bit clocks except when valid data\nis being put onto the bus. This allows other codecs to be programmed with different offsets and to drive their\ndata onto the same DOUT line, just in a different slot. For incoming data, the codec simply ignores data on the\nbus except where it is expected based on the programmed offset.\n\nNote that the location of the data when an offset is programmed is different, depending on what transfer mode is\nselected. In DSP mode, both left and right channels of data are transferred immediately adjacent to each other in\nthe frame. This differs from left-justified mode, where the left and right channel data will always be a half-frame\napart in each frame. In this case, as the offset is programmed from zero to some higher value, both the left and\nright channel data move across the frame, but still stay a full half-frame apart from each other. This is depicted in\nFigure 24 for the two cases.\n\n22 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

The converters can also operate at\ndifferent sampling rates in various combinations, which are described further below.\n\nThe data converters are based on the concept of an Fsref rate that is used internal to the part, and it is related to\nthe actual sampling rates of the converters through a series of ratios. For typical sampling rates, Fsref will be\neither 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, although it can realistically be set over a wider range of rates up to 53 kHz, with\nadditional restrictions applying if the PLL is used. This concept is used to set the sampling rates of the ADC and\nDAC, and also to enable high quality playback of low sampling rate data, without high frequency audible noise\nbeing generated.\n\nThe sampling rate of the ADC and DAC can be set to Fsref/NDAC or 2xFsref/NDAC, with NDAC being 1, 1.5, 2,\n2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, or 6.\nAUDIO CLOCK GENERATION\n\nThe audio converters in the TLV320AIC32 need an internal audio master clock at a frequency of 256xFsref,\nwhich can be obtained in a variety of manners from an external clock signal applied to the device.\n\nA more detailed diagram of the audio clock section of the TLV320AIC 32 is shown in Figure 25.\n\nCopyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation F eedback 23\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

The BCLK\ninput can also be used to generate the internal audio master clock.\n\nA primary concern is proper operation of the codec at various sample rates with the limited MCLK frequencies\navailable in the system. This device includes a highly programmable PLL to accommodate such situations easily.\nThe integrated PLL can generate audio clocks from a wide variety of possible MCLK inputs, with particular focus\npaid to the standard MCLK rates already widely used.\nWhen the PLL is disabled,\n\nFsref =CLKDIV_IN / (128 x Q)\nWhere Q =2, 3, ..., 17\n\nCLKDIV_IN can be MCLK or BCLK, selected by register 102, bits D7-D6.\n\nNOTE - when NDAC =1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, or 5.5, odd values of Q are not allowed.

The ADC supports sampling rates from 8\nkHz to 48 kHz in single-rate mode, and up to 96 kHz in dual-rate mode. Whenever the ADC or DAC is in\noperation, the device requires an audio master clock be provided and appropriate audio clock generation be\nsetup within the part.\n\nIn order to provide optimal system power dissipation, the stereo ADC can be powered one channel at a time, to\nsupport the case where only mono record capability is required. In addition, both channels can be fully powered\nor entirely powered down.\n\nThe integrated digital decimation filter removes high-frequency content and downsamples the audio data from an\ninitial sampling rate of 128 Fs to the final output sampling rate of Fs. The decimation filter provides a linear phase\noutput response with a group delay of 17/Fs. The -3 dB bandwidth of the decimation filter extends to 0.45 Fs\nand scales with the sample rate (Fs). The filter has minimum 75dB attenuation over the stopband from 0.55 Fs to\n64 Fs. Independent digital highpass filters are also included with each ADC channel, with a corner frequency that\ncan be independently set to three different settings or can be disabled entirely.\n\nBecause of the oversampling nature of the audio ADC and the integrated digital decimation filtering,\nrequirements for analog anti-aliasing filtering are very relaxed. The TLV320AIC32 integrates a second order\nanalog anti-aliasing filter with 20-dB attenuation at 1 MHz. This filter, combined with the digital decimation filter,\nprovides sufficient anti-aliasing filtering without requiring additional external components.\n\nThe ADC is preceded by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), which allows analog gain control from 0 dB to\n59.5 dB in steps of 0.5 dB. The PGA gain changes are implemented with an internal soft-stepping algorithm that\nonly changes the actual volume level by one 0.5-dB step every one or two ADC output samples, depending on\nthe register programming (see registers Page-0/Reg-19 and 22). This soft-stepping ensures that volume control\nchanges occur smoothly with no audible artifacts. On reset, the PGA gain defaults to a mute condition, and upon\n\n26 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

A read-only flag is set whenever the\ngain applied by PGA equals the desired value set by the register. The soft-stepping control can also be disabled\nby programming a register bit. When soft stepping is enabled, the audio master clock must be applied to the part\nafter the ADC power down register is written to ensure the soft-stepping to mute has completed. When the ADC\npowerdown flag is no longer set, the audio master clock can be shut down.\n\nAUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL (AGC)\n\nAn automatic gain control (AGC) circuit is included with the ADC and can be used to maintain nominally constant\noutput signal amplitude when recording speech signals (it can be fully disabled if not desired). This circuitry\nautomatically adjusts the PGA gain as the input signal becomes overly loud or very weak, such as when a\nperson speaking into a microphone moves closer or farther from the microphone. The AGC algorithm has several\nprogrammable settings, including target gain, attack and decay time constants, noise threshold, and maximum\nPGA gain applicable that allow the algorithm to be fine tuned for any particular application. The algorithm uses\nthe absolute average of the signal (which is the average of the absolute value of the signal) as a measure of the\nnominal amplitude of the output signal.\n\nNote that completely independent AGC circuitry is included with each ADC channel with entirely independent\ncontrol over the algorithm from one channel to the next. This is attractive in cases where two microphones are\nused in a system, but may have different placement in the end equipment and require different dynamic\nperformance for optimal system operation.\n\nTarget gain represents the nominal output level at which the AGC attempts to hold the ADC output signal level.\nThe TLV320AIC 32 allows programming of eight different target gains, which can be programmed from -5.5 dB to\n-24 dB relative to a full-scale signal. Since the device reacts to the signal absolute average and not to peak\nlevels, it is recommended that the larger gain be set with enough margin to avoid clipping at the occurrence of\nloud sounds.\n\nAttack time determines how quickly the AGC circuitry reduces the PGA gain when the input signal is too loud. It\ncan be varied from 8 ms to 20 ms.\n\nDecay time determines how quickly the PGA gain is increased when the input signal is too low. It can be varied\nin the range from 100 ms to 500 ms.\n\nNoise gate threshold determines the level below which if the input speech average value falls, AGC considers it\nas a silence and hence brings down the gain to 0 dB in steps of 0.5 dB every FS and sets the noise threshold\nflag. The gain stays at 0 dB unless the input speech signal average rises above the noise threshold setting. This\nensures that noise does not get gained up in the absence of speech. Noise threshold level in the AGC algorithm\nis programmable from -30 dB to -90 dB relative to full scale. A disable noise gate feature is also available. This\noperation includes programmable debounce and hysteresis functionality to avoid the AGC gain from cycling\nbetween high gain and 0 dB when signals are near the noise threshold level. When the noise threshold flag is\nset, the status of gain applied by the AGC and the saturation flag should be ignored.\n\nMaximum PGA gain applicable allows the user to restrict the maximum PGA gain that can be applied by the\nAGC algorithm. This can be used for limiting PGA gain in situations where environmental noise is greater than\nprogrammed noise threshold. It can be programmed from 0 dB to +59.5 dB in steps of 0.5 dB.\n\nCopyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

Typical Operation of the AGC Algorithm During Speech Recording\n\nNote that the time constants here are correct when the ADC is not in double-rate audio mode. The time\nconstants are achieved using the Fsref value programmed in the control registers. However, if the Fsref is set in\nthe registers to, for example, 48 kHz, but the actual audio clock or PLL programming actually results in a different\nFsref in practice, then the time constants would not be correct.\n\nSTEREO AUDIO DAC\n\nThe TLV320AIC 32 includes a stereo audio DAC supporting sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz. Each channel\nof the stereo audio DAC consists of a digital audio processing block, a digital interpolation filter, multi-bit digital\ndelta-sigma modulator, and an analog reconstruction filter. The DAC is designed to provide enhanced\nperformance at low sampling rates through increased oversampling and image filtering, thereby keeping\nquantization noise generated within the delta-sigma modulator and signal images strongly suppressed within the\naudio band to beyond 20 kHz. This is realized by keeping the upsampled rate constant at 128 x Fsref and\nchanging the oversampling ratio as the input sample rate is changed. For an Fsref of 48 kHz, the digital\ndelta-sigma modulator always operates at a rate of 6.144 MHz. This ensures that quantization noise generated\nwithin the delta-sigma modulator stays low within the frequency band below 20 kHz at all sample rates. Similarly,\nfor an Fsref rate of 44.1 kHz, the digital delta-sigma modulator always operates at a rate of 5.6448 MHz.\n\nThe following restrictions apply in the case when the PLL is powered down and double-rate audio mode is\nenabled in the DAC.\n\nAllowed Q values =4, 8, 9, 12, 16\n\nQ values where equivalent Fsref can be achieved by turning on PLL\n\nQ =5,6, 7 (setP =5/6/7 and K =16.0 and PLL enabled)\n\nQ =10, 14 (set P =5, 7 and K =8.0 and PLL enabled)\n\nDIGITAL AUDIO PROCESSING\n\nThe DAC channel consists of optional filters for de-emphasis and bass, treble, midrange level adjustment,\nspeaker equalization, and 3-D effects processing. The de-emphasis function is implemented by a programmable\ndigital filter block with fully programmable coefficients (see Page-1/Reg-21-26 for left channel, Page-1/Reg-47-52\nfor right channel). If de-emphasis is not required in a particular application, this programmable filter block can be\nused for some other purpose.

Architecture of the Digital Audio Processing When 3-D Effects are Enabled\n\n \n\nIt is recommended that the digital effects filters should be disabled while the filter coefficients are being modified.\nWhile new coefficients are being written to the device over the control port, it is possible that a filter using\npartially updated coefficients may actually implement an unstable system and lead to oscillation or objectionable\naudio output. By disabling the filters, changing the coefficients, and then re-enabling the filters, these types of\neffects can be entirely avoided.\n\nDIGITAL INTERPOLATION FILTER\n\nThe digital interpolation filter upsamples the output of the digital audio processing block by the required\noversampling ratio before data is provided to the digital delta-sigma modulator and analog reconstruction filter\nstages. The filter provides a linear phase output with a group delay of 21/Fs. In addition, programmable digital\ninterpolation filtering is included to provide enhanced image filtering and reduce signal images caused by the\nupsampling process that are below 20 kHz. For example, upsampling an 8-kHz signal produces signal images at\nmultiples of 8-kHz (i.e., 8 KHz, 16 kHz, 24 kHz, etc.). The images at 8 kHz and 16 kHz are below 20 kHz and still\naudible to the listener; therefore, they must be filtered heavily to maintain a good quality output. The interpolation\nfilter is designed to maintain at least 65-dB rejection of images that land below 7.455 Fs. In order to utilize the\nprogrammable interpolation capability, the Fsref should be programmed to a higher rate (restricted to be in the\nrange of 39 kHz to 53 kHz when the PLL is in use), and the actual Fs is set using the NDAC divider. For\nexample, if Fs =8 kHz is required, then Fsref can be set to 48 kHz, and the DAC Fs set to Fsref/6. This ensures\nthat all images of the 8-kHz data are sufficiently attenuated well beyond a 20-kHz audible frequency range.\n\n30 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

The DAC provides high-resolution, low-noise performance, using oversampling and noise\nshaping techniques. The analog reconstruction filter design consists of a 6-tap analog FIR filter followed by a\ncontinuous time RC filter. The analog FIR operates at a rate of 128 x Fsref (6.144 MHz when Fsref = 48 kHz,\n5.6448 MHz when Fsref = 44.1 kHz). Note that the DAC analog performance may be degraded by excessive\nclock jitter on the MCLK input. Therefore, care must be taken to keep jitter on this clock to a minimum.\n\nAUDIO DAC DIGITAL VOLUME CONTROL\n\nThe audio DAC includes a digital volume control block which implements a programmable digital gain. The\nvolume level can be varied from 0 dB to -63.5 dB in 0.5-dB steps, in addition to a mute bit, independently for\neach channel. The volume level of both channels can also be changed simultaneously by the master volume\ncontrol. Gain changes are implemented with a soft-stepping algorithm, which only changes the actual volume by\none step per input sample, either up or down, until the desired volume is reached. The rate of soft-stepping can\nbe slowed to one step per two input samples through a register bit.\n\nBecause of soft-stepping, the host does not know when the DAC has been actually muted. This may be\nimportant if the host wishes to mute the DAC before making a significant change, such as changing sample\nrates. In order to help with this situation, the device provides a flag back to the host via a read-only register bit\nthat alerts the host when the part has completed the soft-stepping and the actual volume has reached the\ndesired volume level. The soft-stepping feature can be disabled through register programming. If soft-stepping is\nenabled, the MCLK signal should be kept applied to the device until the DAC power-down flag is set. When this\nflag is set, the internal soft-stepping process and power down sequence is complete, and the MCLK can then be\nstopped if desired.\n\nThe TLV320AIC 32 also includes functionality to detect when the user switches on or off the de-emphasis or\ndigital audio processing functions, to first (1) soft-mute the DAC volume control, (2) change the operation of the\ndigital effects processing, and (3) soft-unmute the part. This avoids any possible pop/clicks in the audio output\ndue to instantaneous changes in the filtering. A similar algorithm is used when first powering up or down the\nDAC. The circuit begins operation at power up with the volume control muted, then soft-steps it up to the desired\nvolume level. At power down, the logic first soft-steps the volume down to a mute level, then powers down the\ncircuitry.\n\nANALOG OUTPUT COMMON-MODE ADJ USTMENT\n\nThe output common-mode voltage and output range of the analog output are determined by an internal bandgap\nreference, in contrast to other codecs that may use a divided version of the supply. This scheme is used to\nreduce the coupling of noise that may be on the supply (such as 217-Hz noise in a GSM cellphone) into the\naudio signal path.\n\nHowever, due to the possible wide variation in analog supply range (2.7 V - 3.6 V), an output common-mode\nvoltage setting of 1.35 V, which would be used for a 2.7 V supply case, will be overly conservative if the supply is\nactually much larger, such as 3.3 V or 3.6 V. In order to optimize device operation, the TLV320AIC 32 includes a\nprogrammable output common-mode level, which can be set by register programming to a level most appropriate\nto the actual supply range used by a particular customer. The output common-mode level can be varied among\nfour different values, ranging from 1.35 V (most appropriate for low supply ranges, near 2.7 V) to 1.8 V (most\nappropriate for high supply ranges, near 3.6 V). Note that there is also some limitation on the range of DVDD\nvoltage as well in determining which setting is most appropriate.\n\nTable 4.

This provides power savings when only a mono playback stream is\nneeded.\n\nAUDIO ANALOG INPUTS\n\nThe TLV320AIC3105 includes six single-ended audio inputs. These pins connect through series resistors and\nswitches to the virtual ground terminals of two fully differential opamps (one per ADC/PGA channel). By selecting\nto turn on only one set of switches per opamp at a time, the inputs can be effectively muxed to each ADC PGA\nchannel.\n\nBy selecting to turn on multiple sets of switches per opamp at a time, mixing can also be achieved. Mixing of\nmultiple inputs can easily lead to PGA outputs that exceed the range of the internal opamps, resulting in\nsaturation and clipping of the mixed output signal. Whenever mixing is being implemented, the user should take\nadequate precautions to avoid such a saturation case from occurring. In general, the mixed signal should not\nexceed 2 Vp-p (single-ended).\n\nIn most mixing applications, there is also a general need to adjust the levels of the individual signals being\nmixed. For example, if a soft signal and a large signal are to be mixed and played together, the soft signal\ngenerally should be amplified to a level comparable to the large signal before mixing. In order to accommodate\nthis need, the TLV320AIC 3105 includes input level control on each of the individual inputs before they are mixed\nor muxed into the ADC PGAs, with gain programmable from 0 dB to -12 dB in 1.5 dB steps. Note that this input\nlevel control is not intended to be a volume control, but instead used occasionally for level setting. Soft-stepping\nof the input level control settings is implemented in this device, with the speed and functionality following the\nsettings used by the ADC PGA for soft-stepping.\n\nFigure 29 shows the single-ended mixing configuration for the left channel ADC PGA, which enables mixing of\nthe signals LINE1L, LINE2L, LINE1R, MIC3L, and MIC3R. The right channel ADC PGA mix is similar, enabling\nmixing of the signals LINE1R, LINE2R, LINE1L, MIC3L, and MIC3R.\n\nGAIN = 0, -1.5, -3, ... -12 dB, MUTE\n\nLINE1L/MIC1L O—“\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n \n\nGAIN = 0, -1.5, -3, ...\n\nLINE2L/MIC2L o——\n\n-12 dB, MUTE\n\nGAIN = 0, -1.5, -3, ...\n\nLINE1R/MIC1R 9_Z\n\n12 dB, MUTE\n\nTO LEFT ADC\nPGA\n\nGAIN = 0, -1.5, -3, ...\n\nLINE3L/MIC3L o——_\n\n-12 dB, MUTE\n\nGAIN = 0, -1.5, -3, ...\n\nLINE3R/MIC3R O——\n\n-12 dB, MUTE\n\nFigure 29.

This\ncapability is useful in a cellphone, for example, when a separate FM radio device provides a stereo analog output\nsignal that needs to be routed to headphones. The TLV320AIC3105 supports this in a low power mode by\nproviding a direct analog path through the device to the output drivers, while all ADCs and DACs can be\ncompletely powered down to save power. When programmed correctly, the device can pass the signal LINE2L\nand LINE2R to the output stage directly.\n\nADC PGA SIGNAL BYPASS PATH FUNCTIONALITY\n\nIn addition to the input bypass path described above, the TLV320AIC 32 also includes the ability to route the ADC\nPGA output signals past the ADC, for mixing with other analog signals and then direction connection to the\noutput drivers. These bypass functions are described in more detail in the sections on output mixing and output\ndriver configurations.\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE AND VCM CONTROL\n\nThe TLV320AIC32 includes several programmable settings to control analog input pins, particularly when they\nare not selected for connection to an ADC PGA. The default option allows unselected inputs to be put into a\ntri-state condition, such that the input impedance seen looking into the device is extremely high. Note, however,\nthat the pins on the device do include protection diode circuits connected to AVDD and AVSS. Thus, if any\nvoltage is driven onto a pin approximately one diode drop (~0.6 V) above AVDD or one diode drop below AVSS,\nthese protection diodes will begin conducting current, resulting in an effective impedance that no longer appears\nas a tri-state condition.\n\nAnother programmable option for unselected analog inputs is to weakly hold them at the common-mode input\nvoltage of the ADC PGA (which is determined by an internal bandgap voltage reference). This is useful to keep\nthe ac-coupling capacitors connected to analog inputs biased up at a normal DC level, thus avoiding the need for\nthem to charge up suddenly when the input is changed from being unselected to selected for connection to an\nADC PGA. This option is controlled in Page-0/Reg-20 and 23. The user should ensure this option is disabled\nwhen an input is selected for connection to an ADC PGA or selected for the analog input bypass path, since it\ncan corrupt the recorded input signal if left operational when an input is selected.\n\nIn most cases, the analog input pins on the TLV320AIC32 should be ac-coupled to analog input sources, the\nonly exception to this generally being if an ADC is being used for DC voltage measurement. The ac-coupling\ncapacitor will cause a highpass filter pole to be inserted into the analog signal path, so the size of the capacitor\nmust be chosen to move that filter pole sufficiently low in frequency to cause minimal effect on the processed\nanalog signal. The input impedance of the analog inputs when selected for connection to an ADC PGA varies\nwith the setting of the input level control, starting at approximately 20 kQ with an input level control setting of\n0-dB, and increasing to approximately 80-kQ when the input level control is set at -12 dB. For example, using a\n0.1 uF ac-coupling capacitor at an analog input will result in a highpass filter pole of 80 Hz when the 0 dB input\nlevel control setting is selected.\n\nPASSIVE ANALOG BYPASS DURING POWER DOWN\n\nProgramming the TLV320AIC 3105 to passive analog bypass occurs by configuring the output stage switches for\npassthrough. This is done by opening switches SW-LO, SW-RO and closing either SW-L1 or SW-L2 and SW-R1\nor SW-R2. See Figure 30. Programming this mode is done by writing to page 0, register 108.\n\nConnecting the MIC1L/LINE1L input signal to LEFT_LOP is done by closing SW-L1 and opening SW-LO; this\naction is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit DO. Connecting the MIC2L/LINE2L input signal to\nLEFT_LOP is done by closing SW-L2 and opening SW-LO; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register\n108, bit D2.\n\nConnecting the MIC1R/LINE1R input signal to RIGHT_LOP is done by closing SW-R1 and opening SW-RO; this\naction is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D4. Connecting the MIC2R/LINE2R input signal to\nRIGHT_LOP is done by closing SW-R2 and opening SW-RO; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register\n108, bit D6.

Detail of the Volume Control and Mixing Function Shown in Figure 25 and Figure 16\n\nThe DAC_L/R signals are the outputs of the stereo audio DAC, which can be steered by register control based\non the requirements of the system. If mixing of the DAC audio with other signals is not required, and the DAC\noutput is only needed at the stereo line outputs, then it is recommended to use the routing through path\nDAC_L3/R3 to the fully differential stereo line outputs. This results not only in higher quality output performance,\nbut also in lower power operation, since the analog volume controls and mixing blocks ahead of these drivers\ncan be powered down. This signal path will attenuate the signal by a factor of 1 dB.\n\nIf instead the DAC analog output must be routed to multiple output drivers simultaneously (such as to\nLEFT_LOP/M and RIGHT_LOP/M) or must be mixed with other analog signals, then the DAC outputs should be\nswitched through the DAC_L1/R1 path. This option provides the maximum flexibility for routing of the DAC\nanalog signals to the output drivers\n\nThe TLV320AIC 32 includes an output level control on each output driver with limited gain adjustment from 0 dB\nto 9 dB. The output driver circuitry in this device are designed to provide a low distortion output while playing\nfullscale stereo DAC signals at a 0dB gain setting. However, a higher amplitude output can be obtained at the\ncost of increased signal distortion at the output. This output level control allows the user to make this tradeoff\nbased on the requirements of the end equipment. Note that this output level control is not intended to be used as\na standard output volume control. It is expected to be used only sparingly for level setting, i.e., adjustment of the\nfullscale output range of the device.\n\nEach differential line output driver can be powered down independently of the others when it is not needed in the\nsystem. When placed into powerdown through register programming, the driver output pins will be placed into a\ntri-stated, high-impedance state.\n\nANALOG HIGH POWER OUTPUT DRIVERS\n\nThe TLV320AIC 32 includes four high power output drivers with extensive flexibility in their usage. These output\ndrivers are individually capable of driving 30 mW each into a 16-Q load in single-ended configuration, and they\ncan be used in pairs to drive up to 500 mW into an 8-Q load connected in bridge-terminated load (BTL)\nconfiguration between two driver outputs.\n\nThe high power output drivers can be configured in a variety of ways, including:\n\n1. driving up to two fully differential output signals\n\n2. driving up to four single-ended output signals\n\n3. driving two single-ended output signals, with one or two of the remaining drivers driving a fixed VCM level,\nfor a pseudo-differential stereo output\n\n4. driving one or two 8-Q speakers connected BTL between pairs of driver output pins\n\n36 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2005-2008, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Link(s): TLV320AIC 32",

The user should first program the type of output configuration being used in\nPage-0/Reg-14, to allow the device to select the optimal power-up scheme to avoid output artifacts. The\npower-up delay time for the high power output drivers is also programmable over a wide range of time delays,\nfrom instantaneous up to 4-sec, using Page-0/Reg-42.\n\nWhen these output drivers are powered down, they can be placed into a variety of output conditions based on\nregister programming. If lowest power operation is desired, then the outputs can be placed into a tri-state\ncondition, and all power to the output stage is removed. However, this generally results in the output nodes\ndrifting to rest near the upper or lower analog supply, due to small leakage currents at the pins. This then results\nin a longer delay requirement to avoid output artifacts during driver power-on. In order to reduce this required\npower-on delay, the TLV320AIC 32 includes an option for the output pins of the drivers to be weakly driven to the\nVCM level they would normally rest at when powered with no signal applied. This output VCM level is determined\nby an internal bandgap voltage reference, and thus results in extra power dissipation when the drivers are in\npowerdown. However, this option provides the fastest method for transitioning the drivers from powerdown to full\npower operation without any output artifact introduced.\n\nThe device includes a further option that falls between the other two - while it requires less power drawn while\nthe output drivers are in powerdown, it also takes a slightly longer delay to power-up without artifact than if the\nbandgap reference is kept alive. In this alternate mode, the powered-down output driver pin is weakly driven to a\nvoltage of approximately half the DRVDD1/2 supply level using an internal voltage divider. This voltage will not\nmatch the actual VCM of a fully powered driver, but due to the output voltage being close to its final value, a\nmuch shorter power-up delay time setting can be used and still avoid any audible output artifacts. These output\nvoltage options are controlled in Page-0/Reg-42.\n\nThe high power output drivers can also be programmed to power up first with the output level control in a highly\nattenuated state, then the output driver will automatically slowly reduce the output attenuation to reach the\ndesired output level setting programmed. This capability is enabled by default and can be controlled by\nPage-0/Reg-40.\n\nSHORT CIRCUIT OUTPUT PROTECTION\n\nThe TLV320AIC 32 includes programmable short-circuit protection for the high power output drivers, for maximum\nflexibility in a given application. By default, if these output drivers are shorted, they will automatically limit the\nmaximum amount of current that can be sourced to or sunk from a load, thereby protecting the device from an\nover-current condition. In this mode, the user can read Page-0/Reg-95 to determine whether the part is in\nshort-circuit protection or not, and then decide whether to program the device to power down the output drivers.\nHowever, the device includes further capability to automatically power down an output driver whenever it does\ninto short-circuit protection, without requiring intervention from the user. In this case, the output driver will stay in\na power down condition until the user specifically programs it to power down and then power back up again, to\nclear the short-circuit flag.\n\nCONTROL REGISTERS\n\nThe control registers for the TLV320AIC32 are described in detail below.

In addition, to enable\ncompletely independent mixing operations to be performed for each output driver, each analog signal coming into\nthe output stage may have up to seven separate volume controls. These volume controls all have approximately\n0.5-dB step programmability over most of the gain range, with steps increasing slightly at the lowest attenuations.\nTable 5 lists the detailed gain versus programmed setting for this basic volume control.\n\nTable 5.
