    "Page_3": "MESSAGE FROM THE\nCHAIRPERSON\n\nKathleen J. Wootton\n\nThe Council of Commissioners and | wish to extend\nour greetings to all members of the Cree Nation.\n\nAnother year has come and gone. It is time, once\nagain, for a year-end message from the Office of the\nChairperson and Commissioners.\n\nThis June 2015 marks the end of my term as\nChairperson of the Cree School Board. The three years\nhave gone by so quickly.\n\nDuring these past three years, the Council\nof Commissioners has held all its regular Council\nmeetings in the Cree communities. While in each\nCree community, the Council convened ownership\nlinkage meetings with the local leadership and\nmembers of each community all in an effort to\nmaintain a connection and dialogue with the owners\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE\n\n(members of Cree Nation). These meetings with\nmembers of Cree communities were an effort to\nunderstand their values, perspectives and desires\nconcerning Cree Education, and to align the Ends\npolicies from the Council Policy Manual with what\nthe Cree Nation wanted. In terms of the operations,\nthe Council has set clear direction and purpose for\nthe organization through its Ends policies, outlining\nclearly the benefits to be achieved on behalf of\n\nthe students, staff and Cree Nation. Through the\nExecutive Limitations policies, it also described\n\nthe parameters within which the Director General\n\nis to manage the operations of the organization.\nCouncil delegates to the Director General with “one\nvoice,’ yet maintains control and authority without\n“meddling” in operational matters. Council's focus has\nbeen on the governance of the Cree School Board.\n\nIt created the Governance Process and Council-\nManagement Delegation Policies to guide Council\n\nin its governance of the organization. Finally, the\nCouncil also assures that the Cree School Board as an\norganization operates at an optimal level. It conducts\nevaluations of the Director General and itself on a\nregular basis.\n\nOne ongoing project, which the Council initiated\nin 2013, is the review process on two important\naspects of the Cree School Board. Two working groups\nwere set up to conduct reviews on the Cree Education\nAct and the Cree Component of Cree Education.\nAppointments to the working groups were by\ninvitation and memberships consist of a cross-section\nof the Cree Nation: Elders, youth, men and women.\nAppointments of the working groups were based\non education, work experience, knowledge of Cree\nculture, language, and history, as well as expertise in\neducation, law, linguistics, and political science. All\nappointees are members of the Cree Nation. Both\ngroups are well into their respective mandates and we\nlook forward to seeing what they will produce.\n\n \n\nIn the fall of 2014, the Cree School Board had\nthe pleasure of hosting two Ministers of the new\nLiberal Government of Quebec, the former Minister\nof Education, Yves Bolduc, and the Minister of Native\nAffairs, Geoffrey Kelley. These Ministers visited two\nCree communities: Wemindji and Mistissini. While\nin Wemindji, the Ministers officially announced the\nfunding for the construction of a new Elementary\nSchool in Wemindji. This was a proud moment for\nthe community of Wemindji as members of the\ncommunity and the school staff witnessed this\nannouncement. While in Mistissini, the Ministers\nvisited Voyageur Memorial School and visited a Cree\nCulture class. We also mentioned the intent to review\nthe Cree Education Act with the Minister of Education\nand CSB's intent was well-received by the Minister.\n\nCouncil has also begun to address issues of local\nschool governance. At the annual School Committee\nAssembly, the Council met with the School Committees\nto discuss their roles and responsibilities. This annual\ngathering has proven to be beneficial for the Board and\nthe School Committees. The Executive Committee has\nalso noticed an improvement in the hiring processes of\nteachers and other management personnel.\n\nDuring these past three years, priority has been\non Youth Education. We have seen improvement in\nthe services being provided to the students: tutoring\nservices through Elephant Thoughts, extra-curricular\nprograms and activities with Youth Fusion, and annual\nSummer Literacy Camps in all Cree communities. Work\ntoward offering concentration programs in various\ndisciplines such as sports, music, drama, etc., has\nbegun and will be introduced in the 2015-2016 school\nyear. We look forward to receiving the results of these\nprograms over the next year. The next focus will be\non improving services to adult and post-secondary\nstudents. As well, a capacity-building process has been\ninstituted for both the operations and governance\nlevels of the organization.",

Wootton\n\nLe Conseil des commissaires et moi-méme aimerions\ntransmettre nos salutations a tous les membres de la\nNation crie.\n\nEncore une autre année sest écoulée. Le temps du\nmessage de fin d’année du Bureau de la présidente et\ndes commissaires est encore venu.\n\nJuin 2015 marque la fin de mon mandat a titre de\nprésidente de la Commission scolaire crie, et laissez-moi\nvous dire que ces trois années ont filé a toute vitesse.\n\nAu cours de cette période, le Conseil des\ncommissaires s'est réuni réguliérement dans les\ncommunautés cries. Dans chacune, le Conseil.atenu\ndes réunions sur les liens capitalistiques avec les\ndirigeants locaux et les membres de la communauté\ndans un effort pour maintenir une relation et un\ndialogue avec les propriétaires, a savoir les membres\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE\n\nde la Nation crie. Ces reunions avec les membres\n\ndes communautés cries visaient a comprendre les\nvaleurs, le point de vue et les désirs de ces derniers en\nce qui concerne |'éducation crie, et d‘harmoniser les\npolitiques axées sur les objectifs finaux du Manuel des\n\npolitiques du Conseil avec les besoins de la Nation crie.\n\nEn ce qui concerne les opérations, le Conseil a proposé\nune orientation et un objectif clairs pour l’organisation\ngrace a ses politiques axées sur les objectifs finaux,\nexposant ainsi précisément les avantages a obtenir\nau nom des éléves, du personnel et de la Nation crie.\nLes politiques relatives aux prescriptions exclusives\ncontribuent également a décrire les paramétres selon\nlesquels le directeur général doit gérer les opérations\nde l'organisation. Le Conseil permet au directeur\ngénéral d’avoir son mot a dire en matiére de contréle\net d’autorité, sans toutefois le laisser s'‘ingérer dans les\nquestions opérationnelles. Le Conseil a mis l'accent\nsur la gouvernance de la Commission scolaire crie. Il a\nélaboré le processus de gouvernance et les politiques\nrelatives a la délégation de la gestion du Conseil\n\nafin de guider ce dernier dans sa gouvernance de\nlorganisation. Finalement, le Conseil veille également\na assurer l'exploitation optimale de la Commission\nscolaire crie, en tant qu’organisation. Le Conseil et son\ndirecteur général font d’ailleurs réguligrement l’objet\nd‘évaluations.\n\nUn des projets mis en ceuvre par le Conseil en\n2013 et toujours en cours, est le processus de révision\nde deux aspects importants de la Commission scolaire\ncrie. Deux groupes de travail ont été mis sur pied\npour procéder a ces révisions portant sur la Loi sur\nl'éducation crie et sur la composante crie de l'éducation\ndes Cris. Les membres de ces groupes, a savoir des\nainés, des jeunes, des hommes et des femmes,\nont été nommés par invitation pour représenter la\nNation crie. Les nominations des différents membres\nétaient fondées sur le niveau de scolarité, l’expérience\nprofessionnelle, la connaissance de la culture, de la\n\n \n\nlangue et de I’histoire cries, ainsi que sur l’expertise\nen éducation, en droit, en linguistique ainsi qu’en\nscience politique. Toutes les personnes nommées\nsont membres de la Nation crie. Le mandat respectif\ndes deux groupes est bien entamé et nous sommes\nimpatients de voir leurs résultats.\n\nA l’'automne de 2014, la Commission scolaire crie\na eu le plaisir d’accueillir deux ministres du nouveau\ngouvernement libéral du Québec, soit I’ancien\nministre de l‘Education, M. Yves Bolduc, et le ministre\ndes Affaires autochtones, M. Geoffrey Kelley. Ces\nderniers ont visité les communautés de Wemindji\net de Mistissini. Alors qu'il se trouvait a Wemindji, le\nministre de IEducation a officiellement annoncé le\nfinancement de la construction d’une nouvelle école\nprimaire a Wemindji. II s‘agissait d'un grand moment\npour la communauté de Wemindji, dont les membres\nainsi que le personnel scolaire étaient présents au\nmoment de l’‘annonce. Les ministres ont également\nprofité de leur présence a Mistissini pour visiter les\néléves d’une classe de culture crie de l’école Voyageur\nMemorial School. Nous avons également fait part au\nministre de IEducation de notre intention de réviser\nla Loi sur l'éducation crie, une annonce qui a été bien\nrecue par le ministre.\n\nLe Conseil a également commencé a s‘occuper\ndes problémes en matiére de gouvernance scolaire\nlocale. Dans le cadre de l'assemblée annuelle du comité\nd‘école, le Conseil s‘est réuni avec les différents comités\nscolaires pour discuter de leurs rdles et responsabilités.\nCe rassemblement annuel s'est avéré bénéfique pour le\nConseil autant que pour les comités. Le comité exécutif\na également constaté une amélioration relative aux\nprocessus d’embauche des enseignants et des autres\nmembres du personnel de gestion.\n\nTout au long des trois derniéres années,\nl'éducation des jeunes a été au coeur de nos priorités.\nNous avons été témoin des améliorations apportées\naux services aux éléves, notamment aux services de",
    "Page_8": "tutorat offerts par l’entremise d’Elephant Thoughts,\naux programmes et aux activités parascolaires de\nYouth Fusion et aux camps estivaux d’alphabétisation\nofferts chaque année dans toutes les communautés\ncries. Nous avons déployé de nombreux efforts pour\noffrir des programmes de concentration dans diverses\ndisciplines, notamment les sports, la musique et\n\nl'art dramatique, dont certains sont actuellement\n\nen vigueur et d’autres seront offerts a compter de\nl'année scolaire 2015-2016. Nous sommes impatients\nde recevoir les résultats concernant ces programmes\nau cours de l’année prochaine. Nous concentrerons\nensuite nos efforts a l’'amélioration des services offerts\naux adultes et aux étudiants de niveau postsecondaire.\nDe plus, un processus de renforcement des capacités\na été institué pour les deux niveaux de lorganisation,\nsoit l’exploitation et la gouvernance.\n\nJe remercie la vice-présidente, madame Mabel\nBearskin, ainsi que tous les commissaires pour leur\nsoutien indéfectible et leur collaboration au cours\ndes trois derniéres années. Grace a vous tous, mon\ntravail de présidente n‘en a été que plus facile. Nous\navons tous fait preuve d’un bon esprit d’équipe\net malgré nos désaccords, nous avons su prendre\nd’excellentes décisions au nom des étudiants, du\npersonnel et des membres de la nation crie. Je tiens\négalement a remercier monsieur Abraham Jolly,\ndirecteur général, et madame Bella Mianscum, pour\nleur professionnalisme dans le cadre de leur travail\navec le Conseil et le Bureau de la présidente. Je profite\négalement de cette occasion pour exprimer ma\nreconnaissance a tous les dirigeants, les directeurs\net directeurs d’école adjoints, les enseignants et les\nmembres du personnel de soutien pour leur appui\net leur dévouement a enseigner a nos enfants au\nmeilleur de leurs compétences.\n\nJe suis consciente qu'il reste encore beaucoup\na faire pour améliorer le systeme d’éducation cri.\nToutefois, je suis encouragée par les résultats obtenus\n\na ce jour et par tous les efforts déployés dans le but\nde créer un meilleur systeme d’éducation pour nos\nenfants et nos petits-enfants.\n\nJ'aimerais remercier les membres de la Nation crie\nde m’avoir donné la chance de diriger la Commission\nscolaire crie au cours des trois derniéres années. Ce\nfut pour moi un honneur d’en étre la présidente en\nvotre nom. Au cours de ma carriére politique, j’ai été\nélue deux fois par acclamation. La premiére dans\nle cadre de mon second mandat en tant que Chef\nadjointe de la nation crie de Mistissini, et l'autre,\npour mon deuxiéme mandat a titre de présidente de\n\n \n\nla Commission scolaire crie. Je suis reconnaissante\nenvers les membres de la Nation crie pour leur vote\nde confiance. Il me tarde de poursuivre notre travail\nvisant a améliorer le systeme d’éducation.\n\nQue notre Créateur vous bénisse!\n\nKathleen J. Wootton, présidente\n\n \n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE",

This was to\nensure that the Council Policy Manual is aligned with\nthe important suggestions received at the linkage\nmeetings and to amend the CPM as needed.\n\nWith all the work we have done this year, | want\nto thank our one employee, Director General Abraham\nJolly, and his staff for making it all possible, for their\ntremendous hard work, effort, commitment, and\nfor going beyond at times to achieve their annual\n\n \n\nobjectives and to help all our students reach their\nacademic and professional goals.\n| would also like to thank our Chairperson of the\nCree School Board, Kathleen J. Wootton, who is at\nthe end of her three-year term. Her dedication and\ncommitment as a leader has been an inspiration to us\nall, and she has been a great team player to work with!\nIn closing | would like to extend a heartfelt\ncongratulations to all the Cree School Board graduates\nfor 2014-2015!

One of the efficiencies\nof adopting and working with Policy Governance is\nthe required approvals items on the agenda. Items\n\nor agenda matters that usually took many hours of\ndeliberations now take minutes to approve. Why?\nTwo words. Policy Governance. How does Policy\nGovernance work in relation to required approvals?\nThere is a process that takes place prior to the\nsubmission of any agenda item under required\napprovals. The Council and Executive Committee\nreview the documents a few days in advance so we are\naware of the upcoming items. There could be twenty\nor more items on required approvals but they could\nbe approved within ten minutes. Any items without\nproper documents such as a missing recommendation\nare usually deferred to the next regular meeting. Once\nCouncil or the Executive Committee are satisfied that\nthe items contain all supporting documents, they\nare then approved in one sweeping motion. Like the\nCouncil of Commissioners meetings, the Executive\nCommittee does not want to unilaterally approve\nagenda items without the supporting documents or\nrecommendations. When the process is followed, it\ngives the Council of Commissioners and Executive\nCommittee more time to deal with matters that are\nof great importance to the stakeholders through\n\nthe ownership linkage meetings. Community input\nis therefore of great importance. On behalf of the\nExecutive Committee, | would like to wish the best of\ncontinued success to the 2014-2015 Graduates.\n\nf <dHrArae BCANP Ao <? dof & LIAY pb\"\nb sbo ATA BCH N\"D A>\" AS <P BC\"y\n<iz_ <a¢ bbe <i reAal b AS BNoPo AY PF\"\n<t <j ALAN SoNPo AY A<a'rle Aa<iAs,\n<i>e <= an-<ia'cd L otdlacAt DIP <2 <j\nreact bbe Lb dANSenPo A <2 Leack bbe\n\n \n\niL <dAnseoneo AY, <iDe ANC? dd hobo'tcs b\n\nfF APP AY <j ddtCPo At, <M Le re n\"d\nTod S SY ANd?

We are eager to share\nwith you the developments of this past year, as we\ncontinue to focus on our mission to serve our Cree\nNation members in the realm of education in Eeyou\nIstchee.\n\nAs we address each aspect of the efforts and\nwork we are currently doing within the Cree School\nBoard, be it in the Youth sector, Adult Education\nsector, services provided to students in Post-\nSecondary education, and the many other services\nour organization provides throughout its various\ndepartments, | trust that you will realize, as we do,\nthat our mission is an awesome responsibility. It has\nthe potential to lead us into a Cree future that is both\nspecial and worthwhile. We believe the outcomes and\nbenefits that will come from achieving our mission\nwill allow our students and the next generation of\nour youth and young adults to become successful\ncontributors in our Cree society.\n\nMoving forward and looking ahead, it is\nincreasingly evident and convincing that we must\nkeep our mission in the forefront of all that we do. The\nachievement of our goals will ultimately be reflected\nwhen we see a steady increase and growth in our\nCree students graduating and succeeding in their\neducational pursuits both in the youth and adult\nsectors. But beyond our students succeeding in their\neducation, we are also mindful that this educational\nsuccess must be able to transfer over into our\nstudents becoming qualified and competent workers\nin the Cree labour market.\n\nWe are faced with the pressure to see our Cree\npeople fill the human capacity needs within the Cree\nNation, and rightfully so. This includes Cree human\ncapacity in our Cree entities, Cree Band organizations,\nand various sectors such as business, leadership,\n\n \n\nmanagement, trades, construction, health, social,\neducation and other specialized, professional, and\ntechnical fields. The demand is great within the Cree\nNation and the task and responsibility to fulfill the\ndemand is greater!\n\nThe expectations are high in the realm of\neducation. We are currently witnessing a seemingly\nrapid growth in economic development, the\nbuilding of infrastructure and major facilities in\nour Cree communities, and the expansion of Cree\norganizations, not to mention other areas such as\nthe mining industry in Eeyou Istchee. With this rapid\ngrowth, it appears that not enough of our Cree\npeople are filling the human capacity needs in the\nCree labor market at this time, especially in the high\nlevel places of employment such as leadership and\nmanagement roles, professional, specialized, and\ntechnical fields.\n\nWhat will it take for this to change for the\nbetter in the next 5 to 10 years?\n\nWe cannot emphasize enough, and wish to give\na loud but heartfelt call-out to our Cree people from\nall directions in Eeyou Istchee, that at this point within\nour Cree Nation history we need more EDUCATED\nCREE in our CREE NATION! | wish that this could be a\nconsistent call-out in the next 5 years or more until\nit resonates and grips the Cree Nation, our Cree\ncommunities, our Cree homes and families, our Cree\nparents and grandparents and our Cree youth and\nchildren!\n\nlam of the belief that the whole purpose for\nwhy our leaders negotiated for Cree Education\nin Section 16 of the JBNQA (James Bay Northern\nQuebec Agreement) was so we, as Cree people\nof this generation, would take control of our own\neducation system and run our own schools in the\ncontext of who we are as Cree people. | believe\nthe opportunity to run our own Cree School Board\nas Cree people was meant for us to be successful",
    "Page_18": "at doing it. | don’t believe for one moment that\n\nour Cree leaders expected our Cree School Board\norganization, our schools and our education system\nto be disorganized, dysfunctional, and a failed system.\nThe vision was to see our Cree people be successful\nin running and controlling their own school board\nand education system. However, more importantly,\nthe intended outcome of this vision was to ensure\nthat our Cree students succeed in their education\nat all levels including youth, adult education, and\nPost-Secondary education, and that they become\nsuccessful contributors within our Cree society ina\nsignificant way.\n\nOver the years, and reaching into our present\ntime, some voices of our Cree people look at the Cree\nSchool Board as the sole entity to make education\na success in our Cree society, and place the full\nresponsibility on the Cree School Board organization\nto make it happen. The Cree School Board as an\norganization in our Cree society certainly accepts the\nresponsibility and the major role and mandate it has\nto set up our schools and the education system to be\neffective and successful for our Cree students.\n\nBut education in our Cree Nation has a much\nhigher chance to improve and be successful if we\napply the principle of “working together’ to it.\nCommunity leaders, community members, and\nespecially parents should not distance themselves\nfrom this shared responsibility. Parents must invest\ntime with their children by reading and teaching\nthem at home while they are still in their formative\nyears. Parents and families must realize that they have\na major role in the development and growth of their\nchildren in their physical, mental, social, and spiritual\nwell-being. | believe our students will be more eager,\nengaging, and willing to learn in our classrooms and\nschools if parents take the primary role of teaching\nthem first at home. This is the shift that needs to\nhappen in our Cree society.\n\n| would also take a risk to say that parents should\nbe forthcoming and demanding in a positive way of\nour teaching staff, our schools, and the leadership\nof the Cree School Board, and strongly express that\nyou expect no less than the best education for your\nchild. Community leadership also plays a big role in\nimpressing upon community members, youth, and\nchildren the high and crucial importance of education\nin our Cree society.\n\nThe crucial importance of education must\nresonate within our Cree Nation, and it must be\nunderstood that it is the very foundational aspect\nneeded in order for our Cree Nation to become a\nstrong Cree society. It will take a collective effort, as\nwe must work together in our homes, our schools,\nand our communities to continually uphold and\npromote the high and crucial importance of\neducation to our young generation in our Cree\nSociety. This will lead to our Cree people becoming\nmore successful contributors in our Cree society. If\nwe are to be a strong social, economic, and political\nforce as a Cree government, while at the same time\nensuring the well-being of our Cree society, we will\nneed to continue developing and supporting all our\nstudents to become highly educated, qualified and\ncompetent Cree people.\n\nAbraham Jolly, Director General\n\nCSB MISSION\n\nTO PROVIDE FOR UIFE-LONG\nLEARNING WHILE INSTILLING THE\nCREE IDENTITY IN PARTNERSHIP\n\nWITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO ALLOW\nOUR STUDENTS TO ATTAIN THE\nQUALIFICATIONS AND COMPETENCIES\nTO BECOME SUCCESSFUL\nCONTRIBUTORS TO CREE NATION AND\nSOCIETY AT LARGE.",

Elle\nnous ouvre la voie sur un avenir a la fois spécial et\nsignificatif pour les Cris. Nous croyons que les résultats\net les avantages qui découleront du succés de notre\nmission permettront a nos étudiants cris et ala\nprochaine génération de jeunes et de jeunes adultes de\ncontribuer de facon positive a notre société crie.\n\nPour aller de l’avant, il est de plus en plus clair et\névident que notre mission doit demeurer au premier\nplan de tout ce que nous faisons. D’ailleurs, nous serons\naméme de constater I’atteinte de nos objectifs par\nla hausse et la croissance stables du taux d’obtention\ndu dipléme de nos étudiants cris et la réussite du\ncheminement scolaire au sein des secteurs des jeunes\net des adultes. Mais au-dela du succés académique\nde nos étudiants, nous voulons également que ces\nderniers puissent devenir des travailleurs qualifiés et\ncompétents sur le marché du travail cri.\n\nNous devons faire face a la pression de voir\nnotre peuple cri répondre aux besoins en ressources\nhumaines au sein de la Nation crie, et avec raison. Cela\n\ninclut les ressources humaines au sein de nos entités et\nbandes cries, des différents secteurs comme les affaires,\nla direction, la gestion, le commerce, la construction,\n\nla santé, le travail social, l'@ducation, et des autres\ndomaines spécialisés, professionnels et techniques.\n\nLa demande est grande au sein de la Nation crie et les\ntaches et responsabilités a assumer sont nombreuses!\n\nLes attentes sont élevées dans le domaine\nde l'éducation. Nous assistons actuellement a une\ncroissance rapide du développement économique,\nde la construction d’infrastructures et d’installations\nprincipales dans nos communautés cries et de\nl'expansion des organisations cries, sans mentionner\nles autres secteurs comme l'industrie miniére a Eeyou\nIstchee. En raison de cette rapide croissance, il semble\nque le peuple cri ne suffise actuellement pas a combler\nles besoins en ressources humaines sur le marché\nde l'emploi cri, en particulier pour les postes de haut\nniveau, comme les postes de direction et de gestion, et\nles domaines professionnels, spécialisés et techniques.\n\nQuelles mesures faudra-t-il prendre afin\nd’engendrer des changements positifs au cours des\ncinq a dix prochaines années?\n\nCeci est un cri du coeur sincére et nous ne saurions\ninsister suffisamment sur le fait qu’a ce point dans\nl'histoire de notre Nation crie, nous avons besoin de\ndavantage de CRIS INSTRUITS au sein de notre NATION.\nJe souhaiterais que ce cri se propage au cours des cing\nprochaines années ou jusqu’a ce qu'il résonne et soit\nentendu par la Nation crie, nos communautés cries, nos\nfamilles cries, nos enfants, nos parents et nos grands-\nparents cris!\n\nJe crois que l'objectif ultime de nos chefs dans le\ncadre des négociations relatives a l'éducation crie en\nvertu de l'article 16 de la Convention de la Baie James\net. du Nord québécois (CBJNQ) était, en tant que peuple\ncri de cette génération, de prendre le contréle de notre\npropre systéme d’éducation et de diriger nos écoles\ndans le contexte de notre identité en tant que peuple",
    "Page_22": "cri. Pour le peuple cri, le projet de diriger notre propre\nCommission scolaire crie était voué au succes. Je ne\ncrois pas du tout que nos chefs cris s’attendaient a ce\nque notre Commission scolaire crie, nos écoles et notre\nsystéme d’éducation soient des systemes désorganisés,\ndysfonctionnels et ratés. Leur vision consistait a ce\nque notre peuple cri dirige et contrdle sa commission\nscolaire et son systéme d’éducation avec brio. Toutefois,\nles résultats de cette vision visaient a s’assurer que nos\nétudiants cris s‘instruisent, quel que soit leur niveau, et\nquils apportent une contribution significative a notre\nsociété crie.\n\nDepuis des années, et encore aujourd'hui, certains\nCris considérent la Commission scolaire crie comme\nla seule entité en mesure d’offrir une éducation\nappropriée a la société crie, et lui en impose l'entiére\nresponsabilité. Certes, la Commission scolaire crie\naccepte cette responsabilité et convient que son\nprincipal rdle et mandat consiste a créer des écoles et\nun systéme d’éducation efficace et propice a la réussite\ndes étudiants cris.\n\nToutefois, les chances d’une meilleure réussite\net éducation de notre Nation crie sont plus élevées\nsi nous appliquons le principe de la collaboration.\nLes dirigeants communautaires, les membres de la\ncommunauté, et surtout les parents, ne doivent pas\nse distancier de cette responsabilité commune. A la\nmaison, les parents doivent s‘investir auprés de leurs\nenfants en leur faisant la lecture et en leur apprenant\ncertaines notions au cours de leur enfance. Les parents\net les familles doivent prendre conscience quiils\njouent un réle important dans le développement et la\ncroissance de leurs enfants, ainsi que dans leur bien-\nétre physique, mental, social et spirituel. Je crois que\nnos étudiants seront plus enthousiastes, plus enclins\net plus disposés a apprendre dans nos salles de classe\net nos écoles si les parents jouent d’abord leur rdle a la\nmaison. C'est la le changement qui doit étre apporté au\nsein de notre société crie.\n\n \n\nJe me risquerai méme a dire que les parents\n\ndoivent étre disponibles et exigeants, de maniére\n\npositive, envers notre personnel enseignant, nos\n\nécoles et la direction de la Commission scolaire crie,\n\net n’exiger rien de moins que la meilleure éducation\n\npour leur enfant. Les dirigeants de la communauté\n\njouent également un grand rdle pour démontrer aux\n\nmembres de la communauté, aux jeunes et aux enfants,\n\nl'importance de l'éducation au sein de notre société crie.\nLimportance capitale que revét l'éducation doit\n\ntrouver un écho au sein de notre Nation crie. En outre,\n\ntous doivent comprendre quill s’agit d’un aspect\n\nfondamental nécessaire pour faire de notre Nation\n\ncrie une société plus forte. Toutefois, il ne sera possible\n\nde promouvoir l'importance de |'éducation auprés\n\nde la jeune génération que par des efforts collectifs\n\net la collaboration de tous. Ainsi, nous permettrons\n\naux membres de notre peuple cri de contribuer de\n\nfacon significative a notre société crie. En tant que\n\ngouvernement cri, nous devons étre une force sociale,\n\néconomique et politique efficace tout en assurant\n\nle bien-étre de notre société crie, et nous devrons\n\ncontinuer de développer et de soutenir tous nos\n\nétudiants dans leur cheminement pour devenir des Cris\n\ninstruits, qualifiés et compétents.\n\nAbraham Jolly, Directeur Général\n\nPUN \\asaze i erie\n\nMISSION DE LA CSC\n\nFOURNIR UN APPRENTISSAGE A\nNOS ENFANTS EN COLLABORATION\nAVEC NOS COMMUNAUTES, TOUT\nEN GARDANT LIDENTITE CRIE.\nCELA PERMETTRA EGALEMENT\nA CHAQUE ELEVE ET ETUDIANT\nD'ACQUERIR LES COMPETENCES ET\nQUALIFICATIONS DONT IL A BESOIN\nPOUR DEVENIR UN PRECIEUX\nCOLLABORATEUR DE LA NATION CRIE\nET DE LA SOCIETE EN GENERAL.",
    "Page_23": "sth\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE\nDEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL\n\nSerge Béliveau\n\nOn behalf of all of the Youth Sector team, it is with\nhonour that | present the 2014-2015 Annual Report.\nIt is important to specify that the data presented in\nthis report refers to the 2014-2015 school year. This\nAnnual Report allows us to go back to our 2010-2015\nCSB Strategic Action Plan (SAP) objectives. The SAP is\nthe School Board's \"game plan\" for setting targets for\nstudent success, and our efforts are put together to\nensure this remains our priority.\n\nIn my mandate as the new Deputy Director\nGeneral, | had to establish my priorities as soon as |\nstarted back in August 2014. My priorities for 2014-\n2015 were as follows:\n\n1. Community Tour\nDuring the community tours, | reminded all concerned\nof the CSB’s Mission, Vision and Values. It is crucial for\nthe organization that we continue to value, respect\nand uphold these.\n\nThe community tour was also really helpful in\nreceiving feedback from schools and community\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE\n\nmembers with regards to concerns and focus areas.\nThis contributed to helping us in our reflections\nwhen working on the new CSB Strategic Action\n\nPlan for 2015-2020. In all communities we visited, it\ncame out very strongly that parental and community\ninvolvement have to be at the forefront of our\nreflections and interventions.\n\n2. Increased Accountability\n\n+ Departmental plans were produced, and | asked\nthat monthly reviews be submitted in our efforts\nfor follow up on our priorities.\n\n+ Schools’ alignment between Exams/Benchmarks\nResults and LSIP actions: this is the only way for\nus to know if our students are learning what they\nshould be learning, and when they are not, what\nthe school teams must put into place, through\ntheir LSIPs, to resolve it.\n\n+ | met the Education Services Team as well as the\nsupport staff in Chisasibi multiple times to ensure\nthere were regular touch-base opportunities, to\nfollow up on plans, and offer support to the team.\n\n3. 2015-2020 CSB Strategic Action Plan (SAP)\n\n+ Work sessions were scheduled, which contributed\nto the development of focus areas. Full-day\nsessions with all School Principals were held. This\ncontributed to the main focus areas in the new\nSAP. This work was presented to the Pedagogical\nManagement Team as well as Education Services\nfor feedback.\n\n4. Youth Sector Structure Review\n\n+ — Areview of the Youth Sector Structure was\npresented in January. This review was based on\nsome suggested modifications, following the\nCAFSI Report, which mainly pointed out some\nchallenges around the geographical separation\nbetween Education Services and the CSB Head\n\n \n\nOffice. A number of modifications have been\nproposed for the Youth Sector Structure. This\nrequires more time to plan and implement. | will\nbe working with the departments of Human\nResources and Finance to ensure we continue to\nmove forward in this dossier.\n\n5. Special Project Surplus Funding for Increased\nStudent Engagement\n\nTechnology integration: CSB initiated a pilot\nproject in two schools, Luke Mettaweskum\nSchool & James Bay Eeyou School, with the\nimplementation of class sets of iPad Minis. We\nwere fortunate to have the collaboration of Dr.\nThierry Karsenti from the University of Montreal.\nIt is having a positive impact on students’\nmotivation. Final report is expected in the fall.\nCree Resources Development: We are working\nwith Minority Media to implement a gaming\n\nand movie production concentration in Oujé-\nBougoumou next fall. This community was chosen\nstrategically to retain students in the school.\n\nWe are also confident that this will contribute\n\nto bringing back students who had previously\nchosen to go to Chapais or Chibougamau.\nDevelopmental Approach/Brain Development\nApproach: We are working with Dr. Alex Thornton,\nDr. Lindsay Thornton and their colleagues to\ncontinue to study the impact of sleep, nutrition and\nfitness on our students’ brain development and\nacademic performance. We will continue next school\nyear in 1 to 2 other communities/schools.\n\nStaff Dropout Study (Phase 1 & 2): Phase 1, the\nquantitative phase was completed. Results were\nshared and now Phase 2, the qualitative phase\nwas initiated. Data is being collected. Report to\ncome in the fall.\n\nBuild concentration programs to contribute to\nstudent engagement and retention:",
    "Page_24": "o_ AYEP Entrepreneurship Program (Mistissini)\nwill be starting in the fall.\n\no Arts Concentration Program (Misitissini) will\nbe starting in the fall.\n\n0 Arts, Sports, Science, and Cree Culture\nconcentrations (Whapmagoostui) will be\nstarting in the fall.\n\no Hockey Concentration (Mistissini) tentatively\nstarting in the fall.\n\n0 Hockey/Broomball Concentration (Eastmain):\nin progress.\n\n6. Guaranteed and Viable Curriculum (GVC)\nSecondary 3 units are completed as planned. Math\nTranslation and Mini target lessons are both in\ncompletion stages and will be printed. The GVC for\nSecondary 3 is to be rolled out in August, 2015, with\nmaterials, binders, and training delivered to teachers.\nSections 4 and 5 will be tackled in the next school year.\n\nFrom the Department of Instructional\nServices\n\nIn writing and developing the Cree School\n\nBoard curriculum, a foundational pillar of school\nimprovement is the Guaranteed and Viable Curriculum\n(GVC). This years’ work is made up of three parts:\n\nthe elementary Cree, English, and French GVC\nrevisions, based on feedback from teacher surveys\n\nand school GVC implementation visits. It was a\n\nfull implementation and pedagogical training for\nSecondary 1 and 2 teachers. Secondary three (Cycle 2,\nYear 1) was written and will be delivered to teachers\n\nin August. The Elementary Science GVC for Cycles 1, 2,\nand 3, and the Secondary Cree language GVC for Cycle\n1 was initiated.\n\nFrom the Department of Student Services\n\nAmong the many responsibilities under the\nDepartment of Student Services, parental engagement\nwas given more attention this year and a survey was\ndeveloped and introduced in our communities. Data is\nbeing collected and will be shared in the fall.\n\nFrom the Department of Professional\nDevelopment\n\nThe Department of Professional Development has\ncompleted the implementation of the Certificate in\nTeaching Cree Culture and Language and was in the\nprocess of giving the 2\"4 course of the Certificate\nbefore June 30, 2015. It was also a goal to offer courses\nto the students in the Regular B.Ed Certificate Teaching\nprogram by the end of May 2015. The course for\n\nthe B.Ed program was completed in March and two\nsummer programs have been planned. Recruitment\nof candidates for the Certificate in Aboriginal Literacy\nwas done this year. One course was completed in the\nCertificate in Aboriginal Literacy: CREE and the 2\"\ncourse is planned for early fall. We have completed\n\nthe 2\" course in the Students/Teachers/Educators\nCertificate in Inclusive Education and we also added\nanother course for those who already had the 2™4\ncourse offered.\n\nFrom the Department of Special Education\n\nThe Department of Special Education has been\nworking to put things in place in our schools to\nrespond to students’ needs. Areas of focus for\n\nthe coming years will be to implement relevant\npathways for students, to implement the Response-\nTo-Intervention (RTI) model in our schools, and to\nrespond to students who have additional needs.\n\nFrom the Department of School\nImprovement\n\nWe have made huge strides towards becoming\nexperts in the areas of best practices, including\nClassroom Instruction That Works and Success in Sight.\nWe will be taking on more and more responsibilities\n\nin this area in the coming years. Also, student\nengagement is at the foundation of the department's\neffort to survey students and use the data to make our\nschools better places to be for our students.\n\nFrom the Department of Cree Programs\n\nThe Department of Cree Programs has worked hard\nagain at making sure we continue to produce Cree\nresources for our students. We were happy to see that\na number of the famous Robert Munsch books were\ntranslated into Cree for our students. We will continue\nto make the production of Cree resources a priority in\nthe coming year.\n\nI'm looking forward to an exciting 2015-2016 school\nyear.\n\nSerge Béliveau, Deputy Director General\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE",

Il est important de préciser que\nles données présentées dans le présent rapport\nconcernent l'année scolaire 2014-2015. Ce rapport\nannuel nous permet de revenir sur nos objectifs dans\nle cadre du Plan d’action stratégique (PAS) 2010-2015\nde la CSC. Le PAS n’est rien de moins que le « plan de\nmatch » de la commission scolaire pour I’établissement\ndobjectifs visant a assurer la réussite des étudiants.\nNous déployons tous les efforts nécessaires pour\nveiller a ce que cette derniére demeure une priorité\ntoute l'année.\n\nEn tant que nouveau directeur général adjoint,\nil était important de déterminer mes priorités pour\nl'année scolaire 2014-2015 dés le début de mon\nmandat, soit le 4 aout 2014. Les voici:\n\n1. Tournée des communautés\nDans le cadre de la tournée des communautés, j'ai\ntenu a rappeler a tous les intéressés la mission, la\nvision et les valeurs de la CSC. Il est essentiel pour\nl'organisation que nous continuions a les défendre, a\nles respecter et a les préner.\n\nLa tournée des communautés a également\npermis de recueillir les commentaires des écoles\net des membres de la communauté a l’égard des\npréoccupations et des domaines d’intervention.\nCes commentaires nous ont été d’une grande\nutilité dans le cadre de notre travail relatif au Plan\nstratégique de la CSC pour 2015-2020. Dans toutes\nles communautés que nous avons visitées, il en est\nressorti tres nettement que l’engagement parental et\ncommunautaire devait étre au premier plan de nos\nréflexions et de nos interventions.\n\n2. Responsabilité accrue\n. Des plans ministériels ont été élaborés, et j'ai\ndemandé a ce que des examens mensuels soient\n\nprésentés dans le cadre des efforts déployés pour\ndonner suite a nos priorités.\n\n+ Harmonisation entre les résultats des examens\net de référence et les mesures proposées par\nles Plans locaux d’amélioration scolaires (LSIP;\nen anglais) au sein des écoles. Il s‘agit de la\nseule facon pour nous de savoir si nos étudiants\napprennent ce quiils doivent apprendre et,\nlorsque ce n’est pas le cas, pour déterminer les\nmesures que les équipes-écoles peuvent prendre,\npar l’entremise de leur LSIP, pour régler ce\nprobléme.\n\n+ J'ai rencontré l’équipe des Services de l'éducation\nainsi que le personnel de soutien de Chisasibi\na plusieurs reprises afin de garder le contact,\nd’assurer le suivi relatif aux plans et d’offrir du\nsoutien a l’équipe.\n\n3. Plan d’action stratégique (PAS) 2015-2020 de la\n\ncsc\n\n. Des séances de travail ont été prévues, et ont\ncontribué a la détermination des domaines\nd'intervention. Des séances d’une journée avec\ntous les directeurs d’école ont également eu lieu.\nCes derniéres ont d’ailleurs également contribué\nal'identification des principaux domaines\nd'intervention pour le nouveau PAS. De plus,\nles résultats de ces séances ont été présentés\na l'équipe de gestion pédagogique ainsi qu’a\nl'équipe des Services de I'éducation afin de\nrecueillir leurs commentaires.\n\n4. Révision de la structure du secteur des jeunes\n\n+ Une révision de la structure du secteur des jeunes\na été proposée en janvier. Cette révision était\nfondée sur certaines modifications suggérées\nala suite de la lecture du rapport du CAFSI, qui\nsoulignait principalement les défis occasionnés\npar la séparation géographique entre les\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE",
    "Page_29": "Services de l'éducation et le siége social de la\n\nCSC. Comme de nombreuses modifications ont\nété proposées pour la structure du secteur des\njeunes, plus de temps sera nécessaire a des fins de\nplanification et de mise en ceuvre. Je collaborerai\npersonnellement avec les services de Ressources\nhumaines et des Finances pour assurer la\nprogression de ce dossier.\n\n5. Surplus budgétaire destiné a un projet spécial\n\nvisant l’engagement accru des éléves\n\n+ Intégration de la technologie : La CSC a mis sur\npied un projet pilote visant I'implantation d’iPad\nMinis dans deux établissements, soit l’école Luke\nMettaweskum et I’école James Bay Eeyou. Nous\navons également pu compter sur la collaboration\ndu Dr Thierry Karsenti de l'Université de Montréal,\nqui a constaté une incidence positive sur la\nmotivation des éléves. Le rapport final est attendu\ncet automne.\n\n+ Développement des ressources cries : Nous\ntravaillons actuellement avec Minority Media\npour mettre en oeuvre une concentration\nen production de films et de jeux vidéo a\nOujé-Bougoumou l’‘automne prochain. Cette\ncommunauté a été choisie stratégiquement dans\nle but d’accroitre la rétention des étudiants. Nous\nprévoyons également que cette concentration\ncontribuera a ramener les étudiants qui avaient\nd’abord choisi Chapais ou Chibougamau.\n\n+ — Approche axée sur le développement/\ndéveloppement du cerveau : Nous collaborons\nactuellement avec les Drs Alex et Lindsay\nThornton, ainsi que leurs collegues, pour\npoursuivre l'étude sur I’incidence du sommeil,\nde I’'alimentation et de l’activité physique sur\nle développement du cerveau et le rendement\nscolaire des étudiants. Au cours de la prochaine\nannée scolaire, au moins une ou deux\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE\n\ncommunautés ou écoles y prendront part.\n\n+ Etude sur le décrochage du personnel (phases\n1 et 2): La phase 1, soit la phase quantitative,\nest maintenant terminée. Les résultats ont\nété communiqués et la phase 2, soit la phase\nqualitative, est maintenant en cours. Les données\nsont actuellement recueillies et le rapport est\nattendu a l'automne.\n\n+ — Elaboration de programmes de concentration\nvisant a stimuler l'engagement et la rétention des\nétudiants :\n\no Le Programme jeunes entrepreneurs\nautochtones (PJEA) sera lancé cet automne a\nMistissini.\n\no Le programme de concentration en arts sera\noffert a compter de l’automne a Mistissini.\n\no —_Laconcentration Hockey devrait également\nétre offerte a Mistissini, dés l'automne.\n\no Nous travaillons encore a I’élaboration\nde la concentration Hockey/Ballon balai\n(Eastmain).\n\no Les concentrations Arts, Sports, Science et\nCulture crie seront proposées dés l‘automne\na Whapmagoostui.\n\n6. Curriculum garanti et viable (CGV)\n\nTout s’est déroulé comme prévu en ce qui concerne\nles unités de troisieme secondaire. La traduction\n\ndu matériel de mathématiques est en cours, tout\ncomme |'élaboration des mini lecons ciblées. Certains\ndocuments font également l’objet de formatage et\nd'impression. Résultat visé : Le CGV a l'intention des\néléves de secondaire 3 sera mis en ceuvre en aott\n2015. Les documents et les reliures seront remis aux\nenseignants, qui a leur tour suivront la formation\nconnexe. Nous nous attaquerons au curriculum a\nl'intention des éléves de secondaire 4 et 5 dés la\nprochaine année scolaire.\n\n \n\nDu Bureau des services pédagogiques\n\nLors de I’élaboration et de la rédaction du curriculum\nde la Commission scolaire crie, le Curriculum garanti\net viable (CGV) est I’un des piliers fondamentaux de\nl'amélioration scolaire. Le travail de cette année se\ndivise en trois parties : le cri au primaire, l’anglais et\n\nle francais. Les révisions du CGV sont fondées sur les\ncommentaires des enseignants recueillis au moyen\nde sondages et sur les visites de mise en ceuvre du\nCGV dans les écoles. Le programme de secondaires\n\n1 et 2a fait l'objet d'une mise en ceuvre complete et\nles enseignants concernés ont suivi une formation\npédagogique. Quant au programme de secondaire 3\n(premiére année du deuxiéme cycle), il a été rédigé et\nsera présenté aux enseignants en aout. Le CGV pour\nl'enseignement de la science au niveau primaire, le\nCGV a l'intention des éléves du 1er, 2e et 3e cycles,\nainsi que le CGV pour l’enseignement de la langue crie\nau secondaire (premier cycle) ont été mis en ceuvre.\n\nDu Bureau des services aux étudiants\n\nParmi les nombreuses responsabilités qui incombent\nau Bureau des services aux étudiants, l’engagement\ndes parents était au coeur des préoccupations cette\nannée et, a ce sujet, un sondage a été créé et présenté\naux communautés. Les données sont en cours de\ncompilation et les résultats seront communiqués a\nl'automne.\n\nDu Service de perfectionnement\nprofessionnel\n\nLe Service du perfectionnement professionnel a terminé\nla mise en oeuvre du certificat en enseignement de\n\nla langue et de la culture cries (Certificate in Teaching\nCree Culture and Language) et le deuxiéme cours pour\nlobtention du certificat s'est donné avant le 30 juin 2015.\nNous avions également pour objectif d’offrir des cours\naux étudiants inscrits au baccalauréat en éducation",
    "Page_30": "(B.Ed.) régulier d'ici la fin mai 2015. Le cours pour le B.Ed.\na été terminé en mars et deux programmes d‘été ont été\nprévus. Le recrutement des candidats pour le certificat\nen alphabétisation des autochtones a été effectué\n\ncette année. Un cours, soit Langue crie, a été offert et le\ndeuxiéme est prévu au début de I'automne. Nous avons\nterminé le deuxiéme cours a l’intention des étudiants,\ndes enseignants et des éducateurs du certificat en\nintégration scolaire et nous avons ajouté un deuxiéme\ncours pour ceux qui l’offrent déja.\n\nDu Service d’adaptation scolaire\n\nLe Service d’adaptation scolaire a travaillé a la mise en\nplace de ressources dans nos écoles pour répondre\naux besoins des étudiants. Au cours des années a\nvenir, nous mettrons l’accent sur |’élaboration de\n\ncheminements pertinents pour les étudiants, la mise\nen ceuvre d’un modéle de réponse a I’intervention\ndans nos écoles et la prise en charge des étudiants\nayant des besoins supplémentaires.\n\nDu Service de I’amélioration scolaire\n\nNous avons fait beaucoup de progrés dans\n\nl'atteinte de notre objectif qui consiste a devenir\n\ndes spécialistes dans le domaine des pratiques\nexemplaires, notamment Classroom Instruction That\nWorks et Success in Sight. Dans les années a venir, nous\nassumerons toujours davantage de responsabilités\ndans ce domaine. De plus, l’engagement des étudiants\nest la pierre angulaire du travail de notre service qui\nconsiste a interroger les étudiants et a utiliser les\ndonnées pour rendre nos écoles meilleures.\n\nae\n\n \n\nDu Service des programmes cris\n\nLe Service des programmes cris a encore cette année\ndéployé de nombreux efforts pour assurer la production\nde ressources cries a I’intention de nos étudiants. Nous\nsommes heureux de constater que de nombreux livres\ndu célébre Robert Munsch ont été traduits en cri pour\nnos étudiants. En outre, nous continuerons de veiller a\nce que la production de ressources cries demeure une\npriorité pour l'année a venir.\n\nJe suis déja enthousiaste a l'idée d’entamer l'année\nscolaire 2015-2016.\n\nSerge Béliveau, Directeur général adjoint",

    "Page_32": "MESSAGE FROM THE\nDIRECTOR OF SCHOOL\nOPERATIONS\n\nKimberly Quinn\n\nAs we have come to the end of our five year Strategic\nAction Plan (SAP) and are transitioning into a new\none, it brings much reflection on what we have done\nthese past five years to achieve the goals we set for\nourselves. What we continue to strive for is increased\nstudent success and that each student reaches their\nhighest potential. Among the first steps made following\nthe CAFSI Report (2008) and our SAP (2010) is that we\nfocused more on the areas that would impact student\nachievement, such as: creating a strong curriculum\nacross all levels, building the capacity of teachers in\nbest practices and Professional Learning Communities\n(PLCs), and developing balanced school leaders in\nthe areas of continuous improvement, instructional\nsupervision, and overall management in our schools.\nToday, our school leaders are more focused on\ntheir Local School Improvement Plans (LSIPs), taking\naction with their school-based teams to work toward\ncommon goals and those that impact student learning\nin their schools. While the Department of School\n\n“Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.”\n\nPeter F. Drucker\n\n \n\nOperations has continued to contribute toward the\nSAP in all areas, we have primarily focused on the\naction area aligned with our mandate to supervise and\nsupport school leadership:\n\nA-3 School leaders who are empowered and trained on\nbalanced leadership for continual school improvement.\n\nHere are some highlights of this year:\n\n+ Continued onsite support from McREL coaches\n(three to five times per school) to further\ndevelop school leadership teams in the areas of\ncontinuous school improvement, PLCs, and to\ncoach school leadership;\n\n+ Building capacity of the Coordinators of School\nOperations and School Improvement as they\naccompanied McREL to schools and supported\nthem otherwise onsite;\n\n+ Training and implementation of Power Walkthrough\nTraining with all Principals and Vice-Principals,\nallowing them to record walkthroughs electronically\nand generate reports easily from a database;\n\n+ Principals took part in developing the new SAP\n(2015-2020), allowing them to take ownership\nfrom the start for the next five years;\n\n+ Visiting Whapmagoostui, further building our\nPrincipal team into a PLC where best practices\nwere shared in various settings: in the school, on\nthe land, in our meeting room, and at dinners\ncooked for one another.\n\nHardy Audate, Coordinator of School Operations, has\nbuilt the capacity of several teams through leading\ntraining sessions with each in an effort to build strong\nPLCs within and across each team:\n\n+ Vice-Principals in the areas of: Guaranteed\n& Viable Curriculum (GVC), Continuous\nImprovement, and effective management tools;\n+ Guidance Team, consisting of Guidance\nCounsellors, Readaptation Officers, and Student\nAffairs Technicians, to better align services and\nsupport to our students; and\n+ Teacher teams in the areas of History, Science, and\nMathematics in Secondary.\nIn collaboration with the Coordinator of\nSchool Data Management, Christiane Laplante, and\nCoordinator of Student Services, Nellie Pachanos,\nSummer School is another program managed by\nHardy, where their efforts contributed toward a much\nimproved program in the summer of 2014. Offered\nin more communities, with smaller class sizes, fewer\nstudents required to leave home for the summer,\nand more of our own teachers staying to work with\nstudents, we had the best result we have had in\nany year with thirty-three (33) graduates out of the\nseventy-nine (79) total for 2013-2014. Offered in five\ncommunities this summer, we look forward to seeing\nfinal results as we stand at fifty-nine (59) graduates for\n2014-2015 following January and June exams.\nWithin her role, Christiane Laplante continues\nto improve the accuracy of student clientele data\nshe manages with her team and schools each year.\nFor the last few years, we have a reported rate of\n99.3 % accuracy, completing all aspects of student\ndeclaration earlier and for the first time in April this\nyear. Much of this has been accomplished through\ncontinued training, support, follow up, and improved\ncontrol mechanisms. In terms of improvements, they\nhave implemented online registration for students in\nfour communities, have succeeded in ensuring more\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE",

However, today,\nall schools regularly assess students in reading in\n\nelementary, and some in secondary, to better inform\ninstruction, professional development, and to align\nresources to implement the best literacy practices.\nWhen school is out for the summer, our partnership\nwith Frontier College for the last three years has\nallowed for us to offer free literacy camps to about\n450+ elementary students in our communities for four\nweeks. This is in an effort to reduce summer reading\nloss and give students opportunities to engage more\nwith literacy in a positive way throughout the year.\n\nIn the following school reports, each School\nPrincipal has shared their LSIPs, progress toward\ntheir goals, and results in the areas of Canadian\nAchievement Tests (CAT), literacy, attendance,\nretention rates, and success rates in required\nSecondary subject areas.\n\nWe want to thank each of our school leaders,\ntheir teachers, and school teams for their continued\ndedication in making our schools a better place\nfor our students to be, and for acting as the main\ncontributors to our students’ learning.

To improve reading and writing, teachers\nused effective strategies such as guided reading & writing, reading\nbuddies and interactive notebooks. In mathematics, some teachers\nused manipulatives, but many used word walls and fractals to focus\non specific math components. To monitor students’ progress, we used\nthe PM Benchmark reading assessment at each term and CAMS &\nSTAMS to assess students’ math levels. On the 2015 CAT scores, some\nimprovement has been seen at the grade 6 level, especially in writing\nas we have achieved our LSIP goal of 15% at Stanine 4 or above with a\n17% success rate.

On top of implementing the CSB\nsafe school policy and the code of conduct, the SNAP program was delivered\nby the Cree Justice Department to students from grade 1 to grade 6. This\nprogram enables students to use a proper and common way to deal with\nconflict and bullying. Badabin Eeyou Safe School Focus Team and teachers\nheld anti-bullying activities in the classrooms, communicated regularly to\nstudents and stakeholders through monthly newsletter and daily positive\nintercom messages of respect. A monthly incentive program was in place to\nrecognize acts of kindness and respect demonstrated by students.\n\nBullying is a real issue and is taken seriously by all members of Badabin\nEeyou School.

They have participated in\nregular meetings with the administration and\nschool commissioner, Mr. Clifford Loon. Together,\nwe have met with the band council to resolve\nissues such as safety around the schools, the\nbuilding of two Cree culture centers, parental\ninvolvement, attendance and lateness. The school\ncommittee has also funded school activities\nsuch as the yearly ski activity at Mont-Chalco\nwith students and parents and the graduation\nceremonies. Lastly, the president of the school\ncommittee, Mrs. Beverly Quinn, has actively\nparticipated in 90% of the teacher's interviews\nfor the next school year, which allowed VMS to\ncomplete hiring by June 19, 2015.\n\nThe leadership team at VMS is also very active\nand carries the LSIP goals and actions trough\nthe schools.

At the end\nof year, the administration has also encouraged the teachers to work\ntogether in creating learning centers during the weeks for students\nwho are less motivated to come to school.

In these activities, more\nstudents talk than teachers, as well, engaging activities contributed to\nincreased understanding and mastery of concepts.\n\nProfessional Learning Community (PLC)\n\nThe PLCs in our schools are structured and the processes are followed.\n\nAt the elementary, the math teams build common assessments and the\nFrench team has done immense work to create and build tools to assess\nthe students. The French sector team has also developed a PD plan that\naligns their needs with workshops to increase their capacity to improve\nstudents learning in the identified area. At the high school, the math team\nhas implemented at all levels two strategies to help students develop their\nskills in problem solving such as CUBES.\n\nSafe School Policy\n\nThe school has worked with the School Committee on a policy to make our\nschools safe, the Miyuu Washiyu policy. This was reinforced and parents\nwere involved in the consequences given to students. Many meetings were\nconducted with parents of students involved in bullying incidents. The\nstaff also received training on Crisis Intervention. Our partnership with the\nJustice Department also continued and we were able to offer the SNAP\nprogram again this year.

Teachers\ncontinued to use systemic vocabulary instruction as well as differentiation to\n\nhelp raise achievement. As a pilot school we successfully implemented Empower\nReading, an effective tool that will now be opened up board wide. The Empower\nRead program helped 11 Secondary 1 students improve their reading by one or\ntwo grade levels. Through PLCs, teachers are developing a variety of strategies\n\nto improve student achievement in higher level thinking and applied learning\nsituations which is a key component of the MELS examinations.\n\n \n\nGuaranteed and Viable Curriculum (GVC)\n\nThe GVC is now in place for Language Arts (French/English),\n\nand Math for Secondary 1 and 2. Through walkthroughs and\ndiscussions with teachers, it was observed that students need to\nimprove on their basic skills in both language and math in order\nmeet the expectations of the GVC. Through the support of the\nCollaborative School Improvement Teams, a scaffolding approach\nto the essentials skills was adopted. This is also reflected in our\nupcoming LSIP.\n\nProfessional Learning Community (PLC)\n\nPLCs are the main catalyst for improvement in our school. The\nPLCs meet as departmental groups to cover common subject\nmatter and ensure linear collaboration is taking place. These\nprofessional conversations help to ensure that essential skills are\nbeing reinforced at all levels. A strategy that was implemented\n\nat the PLCs was the focus on applied knowledge for student\nlearning. This again, helped to address the students’ struggle with\nMELS examinations.\n\nSafe School Policy\n\nOne of the components of our LSIP was a Safe School Action\n\nPlan. Its improvement strategies included: establishing a Code\n\nof Conduct, with clear structures and rules, and the implantation\nof bully proof strategies. Our Code of Conduct was aligned\n\nwith existing policies of the CSB to ensure order and a safe\nenvironment for our students. An Anti-Bullying Committee was\nformed and awareness raised though posters and an Anti-Bullying\nWeek. Teachers and members of the Guidance Department\nreceived human rights training through Equitas, which provided\nhands on training and activities for the students. We also\nestablished a locked door and visitor policy, with a log book at the\nmain entrance. This along with the use of security cameras has\ngiven us greater control over our school.\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE",

We now\nhave a consistent monitoring system using GPI and Lumix, with a monthly\nreport of attendance being shared with the parents. This year we established\nanew school wide policy on attendance and lateness. It was shared\n\nduring parent’s night, through social media and postings throughout the\ncommunity. Through the use of tracking, road sheets, and the Local Problem\nSolving Committee (LPSC) meetings, we have seen an increase in attendance\nfor certain students.\n\nParental Involvement h\n\nParents were invited for intervention and information meetings throughout the\nyear. These meetings were initiated by individual teachers, administration, as\nwell as the Special Education and Guidance Departments. Individual teachers\nheld monthly sessions and also launched a successful website ilovemyschool.\nca, where students and parents can interact with teachers and get updates on\nhomework and classroom events. Beginning in March, students were given a\nMedia Arts Workshop. This successful workshop reinforced the Language Art\ncurriculum and helped with our Anti-bullying campaign, as the final media\nprojects had the theme of bullying.

Elephant\nThoughts has been working at James Bay Eeyou School since mid- November,\nproviding valuable support for the January rewrite exams and again in March\nto provide academic support to secondary 4 and 5 students as they prepared\nfor their MELS math and science exams. As a result, 11 students passed the\nJanuary MELS exams or course in math and science and numerous more\nstudents are expected to pass the June, 2015 exams. Elephant Thoughts has\nworked in collaboration with our School Improvement Team to help reach our\ncollective goal of student academic achievement and has been an invaluable\nsupport to both our students and teachers. Their creative ideas and energetic\npresence have increased student attendance significantly and students have\naccumulated over 2800 hours of tutoring time as a result of ET programming.\nYouth Fusion’s highlights include:\n\n1. There was a continued high rate of participation in weekly lunch cooking\nclubs, where students were able to eat and learn to cook a varied and\nhealthy diet.\n\n2. Student council members organized and animated a very successful\nschool winter formal that attracted nearly half of the school population.\n\n3. After school fitness club participants saw a gradual improvement in their\ncapacity to play sports after the workout.\n\n4. Student council members organized a cinema night on the big screen\nand prepared snacks for sale in order to fund their leadership camp trip\ncontribution.\n\n5. Weekly open gym and yoga sessions allowed students to improve their\nfitness levels and positively interact with their peers outside of the\nclassroom and make new friends.\n\n6. Aweeklong event dedicated to the anti-bullying effort provided\nstudents with an information session, fun games and challenges, and a\n“Thank You” mural created by students and staff.\n\n7. Every day, a portion of the public announcements was dedicated to\nwishing a happy birthday to students on their special day.\n\n8.

How\n\nwill we know each student has learned it? How will we respond when a student\nexperiences difficulties? An example of our Cycle 2 group was a focus on writing.\nCycle 2 teachers focused on writing which involved the improvement of vocabulary,\nwriting conventions, improving reading and focusing on different writing. Teachers\nwere able to see progress first hand of their students through this process and were\nproud of their students’ accomplishments and growth.",

Our vision is that all eligible\nJames Bay Northern Québec Agreement (JBQNA)\nbeneficiaries acquire the competencies needed for\npersonal accomplishment, financial autonomy and\ncollective well-being.\n\nThe Post-Secondary Student Services (PSSS)\ndepartment is currently concluding an organizational\nreview and analysis to better align our role as a\nsupport function to our students. We will continue to\nimplement important changes within the department\nto better support our student body for success in their\neducational and career goals.\n\nIn our efforts to improve the effectiveness\nof the Cree School Board (CSB) administrative\nsupport, many changes to student filing processes\nand procedures have been implemented. One\ndevelopment is that a new administrative position\nwas created to effectively maintain student file\nmanagement. We believe this position will help\nensure improvements are implemented for greater\nefficiency and communication with our students.\n\nThe CSB will continue to look towards the future and\ntake necessary steps to assist our students in their\nacademic and professional endeavours.\n\nPSSS Statistical Information\n\nThe following information highlights certain trends\n\nin student enrolment and levels of success in Post-\nSecondary and Adult Secondary community programs.\nFollowing last year’s trend, the data reveals significant\ngrowth in the Post-Secondary Student Support\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE\n\nPrograms.

The Government of Canada provides seventy-\nfive percent (75%) and Quebec provides twenty five\npercent of the funding determined in accordance with\nthe budgetary rules which, as indicated, require an\nagreement with the Crees.\n\nIn the early years of the operations of the School\nBoard, both levels of government failed to recognize\nthe right of the Board to negotiate the funding levels\nand rules applicable. Alternatively, they imposed\nunacceptable funding levels on the Board which\nled to litigation in the 1990's to ensure that both\nCanada and Quebec would recognize the obligation\nto secure an Agreement with the Crees, and that they\nwould provide adequate funding to meet the special\nobligations in the Treaty. The Quebec Superior Court\nheld that a tri-partite agreement was required in\naccordance with the provisions of the treaty (JBNQA).\nThis was appealed ultimately to the Supreme Court of\nCanada who failed to hear Canada’s appeal.\n\nSince the establishment of the Budgetary Rules\nin 1993, the Cree School Board finances have been\nstabilized, and the Board has always managed our\nresources within the budgetary framework agreed to\nwith both levels of Government.\n\nThe Cree School Board and both the Federal and\nProvincial Governments finalized an agreement on\nnew “Funding Rules for Operations and Investment\nGrants for the 2014-2015 to 2018-2019 school\nyears” in October of last year, after several months\nof negotiations. We are pleased to report that the\npositive collaboration which the Board has established\nwith the Quebec Ministry of Education has allowed\nfor the parties to secure an Agreement, which\nprovides certain additional resources to the Board\nat times of fiscal restraint and cutbacks in provincial\nfunding to school boards throughout the province.\nThe Board is very appreciative of the efforts of the\nprovincial team in the negotiations as well as the\n\npositive collaboration of Canada in these tripartite\nnegotiations.\n\nThe Finance Team also continued our collective\nefforts and support to the Department of Material\nResources to secure the funding to support the\nfive year capital plan of $125,000,000, thus finally\nsecuring all the required approvals to build the new\nWemindji elementary school and some urgently\nrequired housing for teachers in various communities.\nContinued efforts to secure all other project approvals\nwere also undertaken.\n\nThe Finance Department continues to try to find\nways of simplifying our financial processes to ensure\nthat the needs of all departments and all staff as well\nas our suppliers are addressed in the most efficient\nand effective way possible. We continue to strive to\nimprove support to the local schools in an effort to\nbring front line services into each of the schools. The\ndecentralization of certain payroll responsibilities is a",
    "Page_93": "perfect example. Throughout the year Payroll Services\nprovided support and training to all communities and\ndepartments to ensure that they are prepared to take\non these new challenges.\n\nPayroll Services also continued to reach out to the\ncommunities with focus groups, where support staff\nfrom the communities gathered in Montreal together\nwith both Payroll Services and Human Resources to\nexchange on issues, to provide training, and to help\nsupport the continued development of a team-\napproach to addressing important payroll issues.\n\nPayroll and Human Resources have established\na closer working relationship to help improve the\nprocessing of payroll information and reporting\nrequired for a broad range of users. In 2014-2015\nPayroll and Human Resources launched the Data\nIntegrity Project, which will considerably change the\nteamwork relationship between the Head Office and\nthe local schools. The objective is to analyze current\nCSB practices, processes, and tools and to recommend\n\nimprovements which will facilitate a strong and\ncollaborative working foundation among stakeholders\nand lead to improved data integrity.\n\nFinancial Services undertook some internal\nrestructuring through the division of responsibilities\nwithin the Department into three different but\nintegrated functions: financial reporting, treasury,\nand accounts payable. This division of responsibilities\nallows those assigned these functions to focus more\nclearly on the objectives of each unit, and ultimately\nensures that the department meets its overall\nobjectives of providing the comprehensive support\nwhich all schools and budget supervisors require\nthroughout the year.\n\nFinancial Services continues to work closely\nwith the Department of Information & Technologies\nto develop new customized tools for all information\nusers and to ensure that the department is continually\nadapting to new technologies. Improvements to\npayment systems are evolving, and efforts to set\n\n \n\nup direct deposits for most of the CSB suppliers\ncontinued throughout the year. It is expected that by\nthe 2015 year end that 90% of all suppliers will be set\nup for direct deposit, a clear need when operating ina\nremote region.\n\nThe Department of Finance and Administrative\nServices will continue to develop innovative\napproaches to working with all users of CSB financial\ninformation, and will be looking closely at developing\nand implementing new tools for budget development\nand management of funds throughout the year.\n\nThe following sections of this report are devoted\nto summarizing our financial position for the year\nending June 30, 2014, and to review certain data on\nstudent enrollment and the financial allocation of\nresources within the Board in a very summarized and\ngraphical form.\n\nMatthew Rabbitskin, Director of Finance and\nAdministration\n\n \n\nFor the year ending June 30, 2014\n\nTotal Expenditures of the Board for the year ending June 30, 2014\n\nDeficit for the year ending June 30, 2014\n\nCombined Accumulated Surplus at June 30, 2014\n\nAvailable Surplus at June 30, 2014\n\nTangible Capital Assets at June 30, 2014\n\nCREE-ATING OUR FUTURE\n\n$149,501,832\n($2,615,435)\n$26,438,410\n$14,872,091\n$162,391,673",
