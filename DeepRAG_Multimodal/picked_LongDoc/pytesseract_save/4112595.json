Limerick Chamber appointed Indecon\nInternational Research Economists to undertake an independent assessment of the performance of Limerick\nCity and to outline measures to support the sustainable development of the city. The research includes an\noverview of how Limerick performed compared to other leading Irish cities which highlights a number of\nimportant findings. The research has been informed by a new survey with responses from over 400 individuals\nincluding business owners, employees and others. This highlights the key strengths of Limerick city as well as\nthe issues of most concern to the Limerick community. The analysis builds on the experience of models and\napproaches used in other countries to achieve the sustainable development of cities. In addition, new\neconometric modelling has been completed to examine the implications for skill enhancement to support\nsustainable development. This pioneering initiative by Limerick Chamber is designed to provide evidence-based\ninputs to national and regional policy. It will also enable the Chamber to input to the consultation on the draft\nLocal Development Plan (LDP) and the review of Limerick 2030 (An Economic and Spatial Plan for Limerick),\nwhich is being undertaken by Limerick City and County Council. This will assist in ensuring that the opportunity\nis taken to develop Limerick city as an economic powerhouse for the region. Furthermore, the findings of this\nreport will frame key issues for discussion in the lead up to the election of Limerick’s Directly Elected Mayor,\nthe first position of its kind in Ireland.\n\nVIEWS OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS\n\nThe views of businesses, employees and other stakeholders confirm Indecon’s analysis which is presented later\nin the report of the strengths of Limerick city. Our analysis suggests that building on the existing skills strength\nand maximising the potential of the proximity to higher and further education institutions should be a priority\nfor the city. The sustainable development of Limerick city should also build on key infrastructural strengths\nincluding access to Shannon International Airport and Shannon Foynes Port. The presence of multinational and\nindigenous firms and the cost competitiveness of living in the city are also important strengths. Investment will\nbe required to enable these assets to realise their potential to support the city and the region. There is also a\nneed to ensure the continued viability of local services.\n\nStrengths of Limerick City\n\nProximity to Higher Education Institutions\n\nHigh levels of educational attainment\n\nSkills base of population\n\nPresence of major multinationals\n\nStrengths of indigenous firms\n\nDiversity of enterprise base\n\nLower cost of living compared to other cities in Ireland\n\nAccess to Shannon International Airport and Shannon Foynes Port\n\nAvailability of local services\n\nStrong economic growth in recent years\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nWVery Insignificant @ O B WVery Significant\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Indecon survey of Businesses in Limerick undertaken on behalf of Limerick Chamber 2021\n\n \n\n \n\nIndecon International Research Economists Page v\nIndecon",
    "Page_7": "Executive Summary\n\n \n\nIn developing our recommendations, Indecon believes at the centre of the new strategy should be a\ncommitment to meeting carbon emissions reduction targets and the achievement of a circular economy. Of\nnote is the awareness of the business community of the challenges arising from the dependence on the high\ncarbon sector and the low energy efficiency of residential and commercial property in the city centre.\nInvestment is necessary to meet the requirements for future growth. Deficiencies in public transport and\ninsufficient investment in public infrastructure were highlighted by the stakeholders consulted. In considering\nthe future development of Limerick city the importance of sustaining the growth in the retail services sector\nand in ensuring high-density development will be key. The survey research suggests that the loss of retail\nactivity and the lack of high-density development are perceived as constraints on the development of Limerick\ncity. Indecon believes that the future model for Limerick City should place a high weight on ensuring that growth\nbenefits all its citizens. Housing shortages and constraints on healthcare are issues for Limerick as they are for\nother parts of Ireland. The research presented demonstrates that a major challenge exists in addressing the\nlevels of deprivation and social inclusion. Stakeholders consulted were aware of the challenges arising from\ngaps in social services, low educational attainment of parts of the population, and housing shortages.\n\nConstraints to Limerick City development\n\nDependence on high carbon energy sector\n\nLow energy efficiency of residential and commercial property\nDeficiencies in public transport\n\nInsufficient investment in public infrastructure\n\nConstraints on healthcare sector\n\nLow educational attainment of parts of population\n\nGaps in social services\n\nLoss of retail activity from City Centre\n\nLack of high-density development in City Centre\n\ni\n\nLack of mixed demographic neighbourhoods\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nVery Insignificant @ O OB WVery Significant\n\n \n\nSource: Indecon survey of Businesses in Limerick undertaken on behalf of Limerick Chamber 2021\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe views of stakeholders consulted on the main areas for future development to ensure a sustainable and\nsuccessful model for Limerick city are presented in the next figure.\n\n \n\n| n d e Cc 0 n Indecon International Research Economists Page vi",

The key objectives of the Plan are outlined in the table below. Indecon believes all the objectives\nare aligned with the requirements for the city but that additional objectives merit consideration to address\nclimate change and social inclusion challenges. Our analysis of the performance of Limerick discussed later in\nthis report, highlights the need to change commuting patterns and to improve the energy efficiency of the\nhousing stock to meet environmental challenges. Our research also highlights concerns over the high levels of\nindividuals at risk of poverty or social exclusion. These should be given greater emphasis in the proposed\nrevisions to the Plan.\n\nKey Objectives of Limerick 2030 — An Economic and Spatial Plan for Limerick\n\n \n\n1. Position Limerick as a competitive knowledge economy, known for its skills base excellence in high\ntech sectors\n\n2. Develop an outstanding environment for starting and growing new businesses\n3. Create the conditions for long-term economic growth\n\n4. Create a vibrant city centre economy with a new mix of economic uses and a strong education\npresence\n\n5. Maximise the local employment impact from development/regeneration\n\n \n\nIn reviewing the implementation of Limerick 2030 — An Economic and Spatial Plan for Limerick, Indecon notes\nthat progress has been made in developing specific projects, such as the Gardens International Office\nDevelopment in Henry Street, the Troy Studio Film Hub, Rathkeale Enterprise Centre and the Engine Project. A\nchallenge in reviewing the Plan, however, is the absence of quantification of a number of the objectives and\ngaps in data availability to monitor progress. Three important quantified targets were set for employment, gross\nvalue added (GVA) per person and the number of new houses in the city centre.\n\nThe available evidence indicates a strong performance in overall employment in the county and high numbers\nof job announcements. However, there is a lack of detailed evidence on the number of new jobs in the city and\n\n \n\nIn d e Cc 0 n Indecon International Research Economists Page vii\nError!

A survey by Limerick City and County Council suggests that 78% of the jobs\nannounced were translated into actual jobs within a three-year period. However, definitive evidence is not\ncurrently available on the number of jobs created as a result of the Plan. There is also uncertainty around\nwhether the €403m GVA gap in economic performance has been addressed. While there has been new job\ncreation in high value-added sectors, Indecon notes that the GVA estimates for the Mid West in 2010\nrepresented only 85% of the levels in the state. This percentage declined in subsequent years and by 2016 GVA\nin the Mid West was only 72.2% of the national level, suggesting the economic gap may have widened. This is\nlikely to reflect the very fast growth in high value-added activities in Dublin.\n\nIn the Plan, a target was set for a minimum of 1,000 new housing units in the city centre. This is a key issue in\nachieving compact growth and in delivering increasing population density in the city centre. The evidence\nindicates that there were 1,044 new units built in the city and suburbs since 2016. With the targeted population\nincrease for the city in the National Planning Framework, there will be a need to increase the target for new\nresidential units in the city centre. The Plan also envisaged an increase in tourism and Indecon notes that\nrevenues from tourism in Limerick increased between 2014 and 2019, however, Limerick’s tourism market\ncontinues to lag behind other Irish cities. A summary of the evidence on performance against targets is\npresented in the table overleaf.\n\nPerformance against Targets Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Plan\n\nTarget in Plan Evidence on progress to date\n\n \n\nDefinitive data is not available on number of actual jobs created or the\nlinkage of these with the Plan.

This represents a lever\nto attract additional skilled employees, particularly given the move towards remote working.

This requires urban density and\ncompact growth. Different terms have been used to refer to these models of sustainable urban development,\nincluding ‘smart cities’, ‘eco-cities’, ‘compact cities’ and ’15-minute cities’.\n\n \n\n| n d e Ge 0 n Indecon International Research Economists Page x\nError!

    "Page_12": "Executive Summary\n\n \n\nWhile there is no one city that encompasses all aspects of best practice, there are examples of successful cities\nthat have implemented sustainable approaches. These include Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Barcelona and\nCopenhagen. There are also interesting aspects of sustainable development in a wide range of other cities\nincluding Vienna, Lisbon, Milan, Bilbao, Munich, Dusseldorf, Rotterdam and Lille and Bologna, and in a number\nof cities in the UK. The application of a sustainable model of development for Limerick City requires that the\nefficiency of traditional networks and services is improved to the benefit of residents in the city as well as\nbusinesses. This would involve the application of new technologies so that efficiency can be achieved in the\ndeployment of infrastructure and local services. The objective should be to increase economic activity and to\nbring about environmental and energy efficiency improvements. In practice, continued co-operation between\nthe third- and FET- level educational sector and enterprise in Limerick City is needed to ensure the maximum\nbenefit of any investment.\n\nAn important issue for Limerick city is to ensure the application of a sustainable model to enable the city to be\naligned with climate change objectives. This concept will require enhanced infrastructure and high-speed\nbroadband. There is also a need to develop an urban centre with critical mass and the clustering of economic\nactivity. Limerick city should also support the needs of high-tech businesses and attract additional investments.\nThis is aligned with the objective of the Climate Action Plan and with the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart,\nSustainable and Inclusive Growth as well as with the focus in the Southern Regional Spatial and Economic\nStrategy (RSES) which placed an emphasis on Smart Specialisation. As part of the consideration of the\napplication of sustainable development to Limerick city, it is of note that there are practical examples of where\nelements of sustainable models have been applied in various European cities.

Based on our\ninternational review, Indecon has identified key features of sustainable models for city development as outlined\nin the next table.

Specific recommendations to support this objective are listed below:\n\n4.\n\nThe focus of policies and investments for Limerick city should be on facilitating compact growth.\n(Government/LCCC)\n\nTargets should be set (and monitored) to achieve an increase in apartment and other residential\nregeneration developments in inner areas of the city. (LCCC)\n\nAccelerate the delivery of projects within the Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Plan (LCCC,\nLimerick 2030 DAC)\n\nSupport the utilisation of the existing housing stock. This could include evaluating the merits of\npotential changes and adjustments to the Living City Initiative to increase the level of take up. Any\nchanges should however be carefully evaluated to ensure the benefits exceed the costs and\nminimise deadweight (Government). There is also a case to extend the vacant property planning\nexemption (Statutory Instrument 30 — 2018) beyond December 2021 and consider other\nadjustments to the timeframe (Government). Potential measures to address upper floor\nvacancies should also be examined. This should be done in tandem with a streamlined regulation\nand planning process. (Government). In addition, it is recommended that expanding the pilot\nBuilding Renovation Passport scheme to target the development of city centre stock should be\nconsidered. (Government/LCCC)\n\nConsider establishing the Georgian Neighbourhood ‘one-stop-shop’ on a more permanent footing\n(currently organised on an ad hoc basis).

Limerick Chamber\nappointed Indecon Research Economists to undertake an independent assessment of the\nperformance of Limerick City and to outline measures to support the sustainable development of the\ncity. The research includes an overview of how Limerick performed compared to other leading Irish\ncities which highlights a number of important findings. The research has been informed by new\nempirical survey research with responses from over 400 individuals including from businesses,\nemployees and others. This helps to identify the key strengths of Limerick City as well as the issues of\nmost concern to the Limerick community. The analysis builds on the experience of models and\napproaches used in other countries to achieve the sustainable development of cities. In addition, new\neconometric modelling has been completed to examine the implications for skills enhancement to\nsupport sustainable development.\n\nThis pioneering initiative by Limerick Chamber is designed to provide evidence-based inputs to\nnational and regional policy. It will also enable the Chamber to input to the consultation on the draft\nLocal Development Plan (LDP) and the review of Limerick 2030 (An Economic and Spatial Plan for\nLimerick), which is being undertaken by Limerick City and County Council. This will assist in ensuring\nthat the opportunity is taken to develop Limerick City as an economic powerhouse for the region.\nFurthermore, the findings of this report will frame key issues for discussion in the lead up to the\nelection of Limerick’s Directly Elected Mayor, the first position of its kind in Ireland.\n\n1.2 Methodology and Report Structure\n\nTo complete the project, a detailed research programme was undertaken which included the\nfollowing:\n\n— Project Inception Meeting with Limerick Chamber;\n\n— Collation of all relevant background documentation;\n\n— Detailed analysis of the evidence on the performance of Limerick City;\n\n— Comparative examination of Limerick City and other leading cities in Ireland;\n— Review of international research and evidence;\n\n— _ Invitation for submissions to key stakeholders;\n\n— Liaison with Limerick City and County Council on Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Plan;\n— New empirical research with businesses and other stakeholders;\n\n— Implementation of new econometric modelling on skills;\n\n— GlS analysis of proximity of population to services; and\n\n— Detailed analysis of research findings.\n\nOur report is structured as follows: Section 2 is a review of the policy environment.

The development of Limerick city takes place against the background of the National\nPlanning Framework which together with the National Development Plan (NDP) forms Project Ireland\n2040. The goal of Project Ireland 2040 is to “make Ireland a better country for all” by facilitating\ngrowth and to respond to the projected increase in population in Ireland of one million by 2040. The\nframework is designed to address infrastructural deficits, environmental degradation and skewed\neconomic growth. This will require delivery on 10 National Strategic Outcomes that promote regional\nparity, economic resilience and sustainability.

It identifies key strategic\ninvestment priorities (see Table 2.4 below) to underpin the implementation of the NPF up to 2028.\nFour funds? with allocated resources of up to €4 billion over the lifetime of the plan have also been\nestablished to deliver on core priorities in relation to rural and urban development, technology and\nclimate action. NDP further stresses the need to address a number of challenges including the\nupgrade of infrastructure in anticipation of the population increase, and the transition to a climate-\nresilient society in the next ten years. Limerick City will benefit from a number of infrastructure\ninvestments outlined in the NDP. These include BusConnects in Limerick City, investment in Shannon\nFoynes Port, regional connectivity in terms of the M20 Cork to Limerick, and the roll-out of a National\nBroadband plan in Limerick City and County. There is, however, a need for ongoing targeted\ninvestment to support the development of Limerick City.\n\n5 Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund and\nClimate Action Fund.\n\n \n\nIndecon International Research Economists Page 5\nIndecon",

The Climate Action Plan has identified a set of policy tools and targets to be delivered across\nthe following sectors: electricity, buildings, enterprise and services, housing, transport, agriculture,\nwaste and circular economy. These, inter alia, involve:\n\n- increase reliance on renewables from 30% to 70%;\n- upgrade 500,000 existing homes to B2 Building Energy Rating (BER) and install heat pumps;\n\n- make growth less transport intensive through better planning, remote and home-working\nand shifts to public transport;\n\n- improvements in farming practice; and\n\n- and strategies for plastics, food waste, and resource use reduction.\n\nThe Climate Action Plan places emphasis on the National Adaptation Framework as the main policy\nresponse to address current and future risks posed by climate change, with the Regional Assembly\nalong with Climate Action Regional Offices (CARO) to support the development of long-term solutions\nto reduce vulnerability at the regional and local level. Key programmes identified in the Climate\nAction Plan relevant to Limerick and the Southern region include:\n\n- the development of a cycling Implementation Plan across Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and\nWaterford based on existing metropolitan cycling network plans, and 200km of cycle lanes\nunder Bus-Connects; and\n\n-  zero-emission postal deliveries in Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford by 2020.\n\n \n\nIndecon International Research Economists Page 6\nIndecon",

The\nRegional Enterprise Plan is key to the delivery of national-level policies into regional and local impact,\nand complement the core activities undertaken by Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Offices and\nother State bodies. Below we outline the strategic objectives envisaged by the REP in the Mid West\nto maintain strong regional enterprise and job creation performance.\n\nKey actions towards the delivery of strategic objectives to be implemented over a two-year\ntimeframe identified in the Plan and relevant to Limerick include: CONFIRM, Ireland’s research centre\nfor Smart Manufacturing that will deliver enhanced Al and data analytics; the development of a Sports\nTech Cluster to promote sports technology research as well as inject 500 additional jobs by end of\n2020; creation of a regional co-working Smart e-Hub network across Limerick, Tipperary and Clare;\nthe development of a Digital Collaboration Centre to be delivered by end of 2020; and, the\ndevelopment of a Marine and Renewable Energy Research Centre at Limerick docklands.\n\n \n\nTable 2.5: Strategic Objectives in Mid West Regional Enterprise Plan to 2020\n\n- Enable a digital and innovation economy and make the Mid West Ireland’s leading smart\ncity-region;\n\n- Achieve a step-change in progress toward a low carbon economy in the Mid West;\n\n- Continue to develop workforce skills and talent and enhance the attractiveness of living\nand working in the Mid West;\n\n- Develop the regions capacity to deliver economic growth; and\n\n- Build a coordinated regional messaging brand for consistent communication.\n\n \n\nSource: Mid West Regional Enterprise Plan to 2020\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRegional Spatial and Economic Strategy\n\nThe Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) is a 12-year development framework through\nwhich the NPF’s vision and national policy objectives are delivered at the regional and local level. The\ndetailed spatial and economic strategy is implemented by each Regional Assembly and includes the\nMetropolitan Area Strategic Plans (MASPs) for Irish cities such as Waterford, Cork, Dublin and\nLimerick. In view of the importance of the RSES in informing the future sustainable development of\nLimerick City, we focus on the RSES covering the Southern region. The RSES for the Southern Region\nwas prepared by the Southern Assembly to ensure strategies are aligned with national objectives and\ndeliverable within the public investment resources. It places particular focus on population and\nemployment growth as envisaged in the growth targets set by NPF for the Southern region which will\nrequire new housing developments and building capacity for new employment opportunities. Further\nchallenges addressed in RSES are climate change, regional disparity and connectivity. RSES’ vision for\nthe Southern region is to become Europe’s most creative, innovative, greenest and liveable region. It\nwas suggested that realising this vision would require investment in capacity building, climate action\nand enterprise development.\n\n \n\nIndecon International Research Economists Page 7\nIndecon",

The primary objective of MASP is to strengthen\nthe metropolitan area of Limerick-Shannon as a key driver of economic growth in the Mid West, by\ndelivering: housing development and infrastructure projects in Limerick City (i.e. development of\nOpera site, Cleeves, Arthurs Quay, Limerick Northern Distributor Route (LNDR)); health care facilities;\nand third-level institutions. On the other hand, infrastructural requirements for Shannon supported\nby MASP maximise its strategic position by focusing on enhancing connectivity to Shannon\nInternational Airport via public transport, rail and road link. The Limerick Shannon MASP further\ncontinues to support Limerick 2030 and Limerick Regeneration initiatives.\n\n2.3. Local Policy Objectives\nLimerick City and County Development Plan 2010 - 2016\n\nThe Limerick City Development Plan (LDP) 2010-2016 sets out Limerick City Council’s policies whose\nvision for Limerick City is to “grow as the centre of economic, social and cultural development for the\nMid West Region.\" The City Development Plan takes into account a medium to long-term\nquantitatively based strategy underpinned by three strategic goals that aim at scaling up Limerick City\nas a National Gateway City by i.e., extending its administrative boundaries; facilitate the provision of\nemployment, education, transport and housing; enhance the attractiveness of the city and its\nenvironment. The Limerick County Development Plan 2010-2016 is a six-year strategic plan for the\nsustainable development of County Limerick. The plan seeks to “develop and improve, in a\nsustainable manner, the social, economic, cultural and environmental assets of the County”. The\nenvisaged vision is underpinned by core strategic policies that revolve around promoting business\nand tourism in County Limerick; enhancing sustainable residential, working and recreational\nenvironments and transportation networks.\n\nThe second stage public consultation of the draft LDP 2022-28 is expected to take place this summer.\nWhen completed this will represent the first LDP since the amalgamation of the City and County\ncouncils in 2016.\n\nThe Limerick-Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy 2040\n\nThe Limerick-Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy 2040 (LSMATS) is a long-term regional-\nlevel transport plan informed by national policy objectives, and developed by the National Transport\nAuthority, Limerick City and County Council, Clare County Council, and Transport Infrastructure\nIreland. Currently, in a draft stage, LSMATS’s vision aims to “deliver a high-quality, accessible,\nintegrated and more sustainable transport network that supports the role of the Limerick-Shannon\nMetropolitan Area as the major growth engine of the Mid West Region, an internationally\ncompetitive European city region and main international entry to the Atlantic Corridor”. The\ntransport planning, whose objectives are aligned with NPF 2040, NDP 2018-2027 and the Regional\nSpatial and Economic Strategy for the Southern Region, seeks to scale up capacity to support growth\nfrom an increasing demand, enhance transport network in the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan areas,\nand meet requirements in relation to climate change.\n\n \n\nIndecon International Research Economists Page 8\nIndecon",

The planned\noutcomes in the NPF, which inter alia include the need for compact growth, high-quality connectivity,\na strong economy supported by enterprise, innovation and skills, the transition to sustainable energy\nand access to quality childcare, education and health services, are directly relevant to the future of\nLimerick City. Also relevant at a national level is the Climate Action Plan and the need to achieve a\nnet-zero emission target by 2050. Within the context of the national policies, there are a range of\nregional and local plans which underpin the development for Limerick City.

More specifically, the 20-year plan works as a framework that\nsets the direction for public and private sector investment to create jobs, accelerate investment and\ndeliver key strategic sites by 2030, with the overarching goal to create “a major economic force in the\nIrish and European economy, a leading centre for commercial investment.” The structure of the long-\nterm plan revolves around three elements: an economic strategy, which seeks to promote enterprise\ngrowth, strengthen the knowledge economy and scale investment; a spatial plan, which focuses on\nthe regeneration and revitalisation of Limerick City Centre; and a marketing plan, aiming at\nrebranding Limerick. In relation to its economic plan, the Limerick 2030 plan highlights the\nimportance to diversify the economy when delivering on key objectives outlined in the table below.\nThese include increasing employment (high-value jobs, new start-ups), and gross value added (GVA).\nTo achieve this, Limerick 2030 envisaged a sectoral strategy based on: i) driving value on established\nsectors (i.e., ICT, Logistics, Advanced manufacturing); ii) capture bigger share of growth sectors (i.e.,\nLife Sciences, Business and Professional Services etc); and iii) secure investment in emerging sectors\n(low carbon sector); and new enterprise growth (i.e., Cultural, Creative and Digital Media).\n\nTable 3.1: Key Objectives of Limerick 2030 Economic Strategy\n\n \n\nEconomic Strategy\n\n \n\n1.

A challenge in reviewing the Plan, however, is the absence of\nquantification of a number of the objectives and gaps in data availability to monitor progress. Only\nthree quantified targets were set for employment, gross value added (GVA) per person and the\nnumber of new houses in the city centre.\n\nThe available evidence indicates strong performance in overall employment in the County and high\nnumbers of job announcements. However, there is a lack of detailed evidence on the number of new\njobs in the city and its linkage to projects in the Plan. A survey by LCCC suggests that 78% of the jobs\nannounced translated into actual jobs within a three-year period. However, definitive evidence is not\ncurrently available on the number of jobs created as a result of the Plan. There is also uncertainty on\nwhether the €403m GVA gap in economic performance has been addressed. While there has been\nnew job creation in high value-added sectors, Indecon notes that the GVA estimates for the Mid West\nin 2010 represented only 85% of the levels in the state. This percentage declined in subsequent years\nand by 2016 GVA in the Mid West was only 72.2% of the national level, suggesting the economic gap\nmay have widened. This is likely to reflect the very fast growth in high value-added activities in Dublin.\n\nIn the Plan, a target was set for a minimum of 1,000 new housing units in the city centre. This is a key\nissue in achieving compact growth and in delivering increasing population density in the city centre.\nThe evidence indicates that there were 1,044 new units built in the city and suburbs since 2016’. With\nthe targeted population increase for the city in the National Planning Framework, there will be a need\nto increase the target for new residential units in the city centre.\n\n7 This is based on the CSO definition of Limerick City and its Environs (excluding the Clare part).

A key issue in the review of the Limerick 2030 plan is the gaps in data needed to\nmonitor recent performance against a number of the quantified targets. The available evidence,\nhowever, shows strong growth in overall employment in Limerick City and County but definitive data\nis not available on the number of actual jobs created or the linkages of these in the Plan. There is\nuncertainty on whether the €403m gap in economic performance has been addressed. The research\nindicates that the target for a minimum of 1,000 new houses in the city centre has been met and\nthere were 1,044 new units built in the city since 2016.1° With the targeted population increasing for\nthe city in the National Planning Framework, there will be a need to increase the target for new\nresidential units in the city centre (see Chapter 6 for more detail). The Plan also envisaged an increase\nin tourism and Indecon notes progress in this sense, as the revenues from tourism increased between\n2014 and 2019. However, Limerick continues to lag behind other Irish cities.

For example, the UL Campus and the expansion\nof the TUS: Midlands Midwest in the city centre will be critical to revitalising the city centre and the\nlocal economy. The largest institution in terms of full-time enrolment in higher education is the\nUniversity of Limerick. TUS: Midlands Midwest and Mary Immaculate College also represent key\ninstitutions in building skills for the city. The ETBs and other Further Education bodies are also of\ncritical importance in addressing skill requirements.\n\nThe University of Limerick has announced details of its plan to develop a campus in the heart of\nLimerick city. This campus will be on the old Dunnes Stores site in the centre of the city. This site has\nbeen derelict for a number of years and will facilitate UL’s expected student growth. UL expects to\ngrow its student numbers by around 5,000 over the next 10 years with several thousands of these\nadditional students being based in the new city centre campus. This will have positive impacts on the\nvibrancy of Limerick City. TUS: Midlands Midwest also forecasts significant student growth and has\ncommitted to €150 million in capital investment between 2018-2022 to support growth of 21% over\nthis period.

This is\nconfirmed by the judgement of businesses and others surveyed which demonstrated that the\neducational institutes and infrastructure were seen as important strengths of the city. However, some\neducational gaps (in terms of educational attainment and STEM graduates) will need to be addressed.\n\n4.3 Future Skill Requirements for Limerick\n\nTo inform an assessment of the future skill needs of Limerick, Indecon developed a new econometric\nmodel for Limerick Chamber to estimate the quantitative impact of STEM education (percentage of\nthe population with a degree in sciences and engineering) and generic higher education (percentage\nof the population with a bachelor’s degree) on employment. More specifically, the model takes the\nform:\n\nemployment rate = a + B,percentage STEM + B2percentage graduates + e\n\nWhere B, and B. are the two parameters we are interested in estimating and quantifying the impact\nof STEM and higher education on employment.\n\nThe model is estimated using data on employment rate and the percentage of graduates at the\nelectoral district level using data from the 2011 and 2016 censuses. This results in 3,409 data points\nover two years: a sufficiently high sample size to estimate the coefficients. The model is estimated\nincluding metropolitan area fixed effects in order to control for systematic and time-invariant\ndifferences across regions that would otherwise bias the estimates.\n\nThe regression results are shown in Figure 4.6 which show that estimates of B, and B, are 0.208 and\n0.178 respectively and are statistically significant at any conventional confidence level. They suggest\nthat a percentage point increase in the share of the population with a STEM degree results in an\nincrease in employment of about 0.21 percentage points, and that a percentage point increase in the\nshare of the population with any bachelor’s degree increases employment by 0.18 percentage points.\nThis implies that over time there is a potential for employment in Limerick to increase significantly if\nthe educational gap (in terms of the number of graduates and the share of degrees in STEM subjects)\nwith other metropolitan regions is addressed. Efforts to increase the share of graduates living in\nLimerick and, in particular, graduates in the STEM subjects would support sustainable growth in the\ncity.\n\n \n\n| n d e Cc 0 n Indecon International Research Economists Page 26",

This\nis particularly significant as employment not only provides the basis for generating per capita incomes\nbut is a key determinant to address poverty and social exclusion. While county data is only available\nto 2016, this indicated that there were significant improvements in the period 2011 — 2016. Indecon\nnotes that employment trends in part reflect national labour market changes and the remarkable\nimprovement in employment numbers in Ireland in the years prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Table 5.1 highlights the impact\nof Covid-19 on youth employment and shows that people under 25 are more likely to be on the\npandemic unemployment payment (PUP). There has also been a significantly larger percentage\nincrease in the numbers on the Live Register in this age group.

(The tourism businesses in the city also report this as a\nsignificant strength.) The previous record of attracting mobile investment is an example of the\nbenefits of demonstration effects.” In the case of multinationals and indigenous firms based in\nLimerick City and Shannon, this represents an advantage for Limerick in its ability to attract additional\ninvestment. This concept has been referred to by the US Nobel Prize Winner, Paul Krugman, as “a\nprocess of reinforcement of initial advantage.” It reflects first-mover advantage which was\npreviously referred to by Professor Dermot McAleese” and discussed in the book by Gray, Swinand\nand Batt on Ireland’s Comparative Advantages for Foreign Investment.’?\n\nThe evidence examined by Indecon indicates there are currently 67 companies supported by the\nIndustrial Development Agency (IDA) in county Limerick. As shown in Table 5.4, per capita figures\nindicate that the number of IDA assisted companies is similar to Cork and Galway county but half the\nlevels in Dublin.

These companies\nemployed around 10,000 in 2020.\n\n22 For example, Krugman, P., in a review of Ireland’s performance noted that firms considering investment in other countries face\nuncertainties and in “these circumstances, firms have a strong incentive to observe each other’s decisions, and where possible experience,\neven if there is no direct linkage between those decisions. And these mutual observations can cause a tendency for investment to\nconcentrate in few destinations”. Krugman noted this is over and above the usual external economic arguments”.

The significance of Shannon\nInternational Airport in connecting Limerick to international tourism and export markets is of\nparticular importance. Ensuring the viability and development of Shannon International Airport post-\nCovid-19 should be a priority as well as the development of Shannon Foynes Port. Investment in road\nand rail infrastructure, including the M20 project, will be a requirement for the future expansion of\nthe city. There is also a need for investment in broadband to support businesses and to facilitate\nincreased home working. Given the importance of Shannon International Airport as a key strength of\nthe Limerick city region, of note is that there were over 13,200 commercial flights at the airport during\n2019. The number of passengers using Shannon Airport amounted to over 1.6 million before the\nCovid-19 pandemic.\n\nTable 6.17: Shannon Airport Statistics\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2013 2019\nNumber of Commercial Flights (000s) 12.6 13.2\nNumber of Freight (000s Tonnes) 13.9 12.7\nNumber of Passengers (000s) 1,308 1,616\nSource: Indecon analysis of CSO data\n\n \n\nAs a city, Limerick is critically dependent on external trade and investment to support its successful\ndevelopment. As well as Shannon International Airport, Shannon Foynes Port plays a key strategic\nrole in supporting the economic development of the city as well as for the wider region and nationally.\nThis is reflected in the fact that the Port handled over 9.6 million tonnes in 2019. Its status as a Tier\n1 Port of National Significance and an EU Ten-T port is exemplified by the fact that it is lreland’s\nsecond-largest port in terms of volume of throughput. Previous Indecon research, undertaken on\nbehalf of Shannon Foynes, estimates that the economic contribution of Shannon Foynes Port, based\non the value of the trade it services, is likely to be over €7.7 billion annually, based on figures for\n2019. The research indicates that this trade, in addition to the direct and indirect impacts of port-\n\n \n\n| n d e Cc 0 n Indecon International Research Economists Page 45",

Wind generation (mostly\nonshore wind) is a significant component of this representing 32% of all electricity generated. The\nfirst Climate Action Plan (CAP) was published in 2019 and set an ambition of at least 3.5 GW of\noffshore wind by 2030. The recent Programme for Government increased this target to 5 GW which\nwill require significant investment. A recent report by GDG”° found that SFPC’s “current facilities\ngenerally meet the port requirements for various areas of offshore wind construction.” The report\nconcludes that the port will need investment in new dedicated facilities. As such, “overall\ndevelopment is required to ensure SFPC has new dedicated facilities.” This development could easily\nbe facilitated as SFPC has an existing 250 ha landbank with an additional 1,200 ha zoned for port\nrelated activity. This is important in the context of the future decommissioning of the Moneypoint\npower plant which has significant links with the Shannon Foynes Port.\n\n6.4 Implications of Analysis on Housing, Infrastructure and Connectivity\n\nThere is a need to ensure that housing supply expands to meet the population growth in Limerick.\nEven to meet a population increase of 10% which is lower than the targets in the National Planning\nFramework will require approximately 1,100 new housing units per year. To achieve compact growth\na significant percentage of these should be in Limerick city. A key issue for Limerick in meeting climate\nchange objectives is the age and low levels of energy efficiency of the housing stock. There is a need\nfor a major retrofitting programme to improve the energy efficiency of housing in Limerick city. The\nconnectivity of the population base in Limerick and the means of travel are important in ensuring that\nLimerick city can meet the climate change objectives. Currently, there is a high reliance on car\ntransport. Ensuring that the infrastructure and services and other measures are available to reduce\nthis percentage is an important challenge for the application of a sustainable model for the city. One\nof the advantages of Limerick city is the proximity to essential services such as parks and schools.\nUtilising the strength of the proximity to build a sustainable strategy should be given high priority.\nCommuting between Limerick and the rest of Ireland and internationally is also critical. This requires\ninvestment in infrastructure including road, rail, ports and airports.\n\n20 Gavin & Doherty Geosolutions (2020) “Shannon Estuary: Offshore Wind Potential Study”\n\n \n\n| n d e Cc 0 n Indecon International Research Economists Page 46",

This utilises data\nfrom the Smart City Index and the Global Human Centre Data Centre. The Smart City Index was\ndeveloped by the Institute for Management and Development in collaboration with the Singapore\nUniversity for Technology and Design and is computed for 115 cities. The aim of the index is to capture\nthe residents’ perceptions on the effectiveness and availability of technological applications and\nother issues. These include a diversity of areas such as local governance, traffic congestion and\naccessibility to the local government’s decisions.\n\nIndecon has utilised three variables that capture key features of sustainable models including the\neconomic and environmental performance of each city, namely: the GDP per capita, the\nconcentration of air pollution (PM2.5) and the share of the population with access to green spaces.\nThe purpose of this new Indecon regression analysis is to analyse the extent to which cities will pursue\nsustainable models of development outperform their counterparts. As part of our analysis, we\nattribute to each city in the sample a score from 1 to 10 matching their 2020 smartness index (D to\nAAA) and regress it on the three outcomes of interest. More specifically, we estimate a simple\nunivariate regression model for GDP per capita, concentration of PM2.5 and access to green, taking\nthe form:\n\nOutcome; = By + By Smart Score; + €;\n\nThe estimates of the parameter B, indicate the expected change in the outcome of interest that a\nunit increase in the “smartness” rate would imply. The results are shown in Table 8.1.\n\nTable 8.1: Impact of “Smart” Cities\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP per capita PM 2.5 Share green\nBy 3,300 -3.18 0.04\nR-squared 0.24 0.14 0.21\nMean variable 22,734 24.75 0.25\nUnit PPP 2007 $ pg/m? % inhabitants\nSource: Authors’ calculation from SMI and Global Human Centre Data. All the B, are statistically significant at every\nconventional level.\n\n \n\nThese findings suggest that cities which follow a sustainable model are likely to have higher income\nand are less polluted and greener than their counterparts. Such results are statistically significant.\nThese results can be visualized in Figure 8.1, which clearly show that higher indexes of “smartness”\ncorrelate with higher income per capita, lower pollution levels and more access to green spaces.\n\nAlthough further research and econometric analysis on the impact of sustainable models may be\nwarranted, Indecon believes that the results presented here support a model of sustainable\ndevelopment. Such a model is aligned with national policy and with the experience of other cities\ninternationally.\n\n \n\n| n d e Cc 0 n Indecon International Research Economists Page 53",

These models are focused on the implementation of innovative policies to improve the\nlives of citizens by providing public infrastructure, improvement in the quality and the efficiency of\nservices and a move towards a more skill-intensive and less pollutant approach to economic\ndevelopment. This requires urban density and compact growth. Different terms have been used to\nrefer to these models of sustainable urban development, including ‘smart cities’, ‘eco-cities’,\n‘compact cities’ and ‘15-minute cities’. Indecon believes that it is much more important to ensure\nthat key features of the sustainable models are implemented than which is the best terminology to\nuse.\n\nWhile there is no one city which encompasses all aspects of best practice, there are examples of\nsuccessful cities that have implemented sustainable approaches. These include Amsterdam,\n\n \n\nIn d e Cc 0 n Indecon International Research Economists Page 54\nError! No text of specified style in document.",

This would involve technology being embedded so that efficiency can be achieved in the\ndeployment of infrastructure and local services. The objective should be to increase economic activity\nand to bring about environmental and energy efficiency improvements. Continued co-operation\nbetween the third-level and FET-level educational sectors and enterprise in Limerick city is needed to\nensure the maximum benefit of any investment. Within each of these areas, there is a need for\nsupporting investment.?°\n\nAn important issue for Limerick city is to ensure the application of a sustainable model to enable the\ncity to be aligned with climate change objectives. This concept will require enhanced infrastructure\nand high-speed broadband. There is also a need to develop an urban centre with critical mass and\nthe clustering of economic activity. Limerick city should also support the needs of high-tech\nbusinesses and to attract additional investments.

Deficiencies in public transport and insufficient investment in public infrastructure were\nhighlighted by businesses consulted. In considering the future development of Limerick city the\nimportance of sustaining the growth in the retail services sector and in ensuring high-density\ndevelopment will be important. The new survey research suggests that the loss of retail activity and\nthe lack of high-density development were seen as constraints on the development of Limerick city.\nIndecon believes that the future model for Limerick city should also place a high weight on ensuring\nthat growth benefits all its citizens. Housing shortages and constraints on healthcare are issues for\nLimerick as they are for other parts of Ireland.

The availability of daytime,\nevening and night-time activities will be important. This will require an integrated approach involving\nthe acceleration of the important key projects in the Limerick 2030 Plan including residential,\ncommercial, cultural, educational and public realm initiatives. It will also require measures to enhance\nmobility within the city, reduce its carbon contribution and attract new innovative business. In\naddition, measures to enhance skills and reduce social exclusion will be critical to realising the\nexceptional potential of the city as a location with a high quality of living.\n\nBased on the research undertaken, Indecon has developed a number of policy recommendations for\nconsideration by Limerick Chamber and by local and national policymakers to assist in the future\ndevelopment of the city. These recommendations stem from the proposed model of sustainable\ndevelopment in Chapter 8 and are summarised in the tables overleaf, with 66 actionable items. These\nactionable items are informed by the research and analysis undertaken and by our examination of\ninternational models of sustainable development. They are also supported by an independent review\nof the policy context, and our analysis of the progress in implementing the economic and spatial plan,\nand of the performance of Limerick city.

Ensure compact growth and increase the provision of high-density housing in the city centre\n\nIndecon recommends that the provision of high-density housing in Limerick city should be increased\nto ensure compact growth. A number of specific recommendations to support these objectives are\nlisted below:\n\n- The focus of policies and investments for Limerick city should be on facilitating compact\ngrowth. (Government/LCCC)\n\n- Targets should be set (and monitored) to achieve an increase in apartment and other\nresidential regeneration developments in inner areas of the city. (LCCC)\n\n- Accelerate the delivery of projects within the Limerick 2030 Economic and Spatial Plan.\n(LCCC/Limerick 2030 DAC)\n\n- Support the utilisation of the existing housing stock. This could include evaluating the\nmerits of potential changes and adjustments to the Living City Initiative to increase the\nlevel of take up. Any changes should however be carefully evaluated to ensure the\nbenefits exceed the costs and minimise deadweight (Government). There is also a case\nto extend the vacant property planning exemption (Statutory Instrument 30 — 2018)\nbeyond December 2021 and consider other adjustments to the timeframe (Government).\nPotential measures to address upper floor vacancies should also be examined. This\nshould be done in tandem with a streamlined regulation and planning process.\n(Government). In addition, it is recommended that expanding the pilot Building\nRenovation Passport scheme to target the development of city centre stock should be\nconsidered.

This will require action from a number of public stakeholders.\nSpecific recommendations to support these climate action measures include:\n\n- Coordination at local level of the national funding available for deep retrofitting\nprogrammes (grants/competitive loans/workshops) for private residential units in city\ncentre. (Government/LCCC)\n\n- Accelerate supports under the Energy Retrofitting Programme for Social Housing.\n(Government/LCCC)\n\n- Inline with the Climate Action Plan (CAP) and the Limerick-Shannon Metropolitan Area\nTransport Strategy (LSMATS), develop an ambitious implementation plan (with particular\nemphasis on cycling, walking and e-vehicles) in collaboration with relevant stakeholders\nin the city.

(LCCC)\n\n- Implementation of a co-ordinated approach to school zones which may reduce traffic\ncongestion (LCCC)\n\n- Implementation of technology to provide efficient means of travel. For example, a\nLimerick travel app that draws on the bus/rail information provided on the TFI Real Time\nlreland app but also includes information on safe cycling, accessible walking routes, bike\nstations and e-charging locations. (LCCC, NTA)\n\n- Establish a Limerick Energy Forum to support the development of renewable energy,\nparticularly offshore development. (LCCC, Limerick Chamber)\n\n- Invest in the necessary ICT and Smart Energy storage infrastructure so that Limerick is\nwell placed to access any energy surpluses from Moneypoint. (LCCC)\n\n- Work with industry and academia to plan for the long term whereby supply from offshore\nenergy production could be used to address energy poverty. (Government, LCCC)\n\nAs discussed previously, the focus of many modern cities is on sustainable development and reducing\nthe carbon intensity of the city.

The idea behind the practice is to encourage environmentally responsible behaviour\nand to support local retailers. Tropa Verde is a game-based web platform. Citizens can earn recycling vouchers\nand exchange them for rewards at Santiago’s City Council and participating local retailers. The website connects\nthe following elements; The locations where citizens can dispose of waste and get their rewards: green points,\ncivic and local social centres, recovery points, Santiago’s City Council; Local businesses that provide gifts or\ndiscounts: retailers, restaurants, outdoor activities, shops and other businesses.\n\nCitizens who have recycled using this waste disposal network or at green points, get points which they cash in\nonline on the platform. This platform shows what deals or discounts can be collected with those points and at\nwhich retailers. Citizens can then visit to the local businesses or local services for their reward. The involvement\nof citizens in recycling has increased, with a higher volume of visitors at the waste collection points.\n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Indecon Analysis\n\n \n\n \n\n6.

LECP’s strategy is also intended to influence directly and indirectly\nthe action of an intersection of different bodies, such as IDA, Enterprise Ireland, SOLAS, Local\nAuthority etc. The primary objective of the Economic plan is to “promote a more integrated, inclusive\nand sustainable approach to economic development in the local authority area”. It focuses on job\ncreation in the local authority area by promoting investment that generates economic growth. It also\nplaces an emphasis on diversification to build on economic resilience. On the other hand, the primary\nobjective of the Community plan places a strong emphasis on social inclusion and deprivation\nreduction, with the vision “to promote quality of life for local communities across Limerick ity and\ncounty, promote social equality, embrace diversity and improve social integration and community\ncohesion.”\n\nLimerick City and County Council’s Corporate Plan, 2019-2024\n\nThe Limerick City and County Council’s Corporate Plan is a five-year framework for action that puts\nforward a vision for both city and council built on organisational activity, governance and business\narchitecture, with the ambition to “make Limerick the driver for the Mid West through positive\ndisruption and innovative citizen engagement.” The plan promotes investment, connectivity through\nmajor infrastructural projects and businesses as well as places a strong focus on community and\nhousing development. It is based on four pillars: economic, community, housing development, water\nand fire emergency service, physical (connectivity).

Lisbon was recently granted by the European Commission\na €350,000 Green Capital award as “an inspiration and role-model for cities across the EU,\ndemonstrating clearly that sustainability and economic growth go hand in hand.” In this regard, the\ncity has been particularly focused in the areas of sustainable urban mobility, sustainable land use,\ngreen growth and eco-innovation.\n\nIn the area of sustainable urban mobility, Lisbon has been prioritizing public transport, walking\n(Pedestrian Accessibility Plan) and cycling. For instance, in 2017, the bike-sharing system GIRA was\nintroduced, providing e-bikes to be used in the hilly areas of the city. Moreover, the city embraces\nthe use of micro-mobility (i.e., e-scooter and e-bike companies) with private providers; whereas\nCarris,’® Lisbon’s transport company has planned to increase electric vehicles in its public transport\nsystem, as well as target “to shift 150,000 motorists to more sustainable modes of travel by 2030.”\n\nFurthermore, Lisbon counts the world’s largest number of charging points for electric vehicles and\nwas the first European city to adopt the Mobility Data Specification (MDS), a data sharing system\nwhich allows data comparison and analysis from mobility service providers (i.e., bike-shares, e-\nscooters). This is a clear practical implementation of the concept of smart city. Moreover, the Smart\nOpen Lisboa Programme” is an open innovation programme that finds innovative solutions (i.e.,\nsmart cars, e-payment, Al and biometrics) in the areas of road and infrastructure management, urban\nmobility services, public transportation, parking management etc. Other smart solutions that have\nbeen implemented in the city include the Corporate Mobility Pact, that offers mobility credits for\ncompanies/employees that use bicycles/transport passes and e-vehicles for their commute.\n\nWith regards to sustainable land use policies,”® Lisbon has been committed to enhance the access to\nits natural areas by linking the city’s cycle and walking paths to its natural amenities (i.e., Montsanto\nPark, Tagus River) to improve the accessibility to local outdoor recreational space. Besides providing\ngreater access to its existing green areas, Lisbon has also planned to create new green space with\nfocus on biodiversity and wildlife protection.\n\nLisbon’s sustainable development policies are incorporated in the “Programa Operacional Regional\nde Lisboa 2020”,”° Lisbon’s urban development strategy, whose main objectives and priorities are to\nincrease research and development and innovation; enhance SMEs competitiveness; facilitate the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy; focus on environmental protection and efficient use of resources\nand improve the life quality in the city by providing smart solutions for energy efficiency, mobility and\nsocial cohesion.

    "Page_102": "Annex 3 | Outline of Potential KPIs\n\n \n\nIndecon believes that setting key performance indicators is critical to any plans for Limerick city.\nWithin the context of sustainable development and urban systems, the use of indicators is contingent\non the definition of sustainable development and serve different purposes, such as decision-making\nand urban planning; encouraging changes and sustainability awareness; monitoring progress towards\ngoals and sustainable development targets.°° Overall, indicators vary by the approach used to\nmeasure sustainability, selection criteria, context and urban size to which they are applied (i.e., at\nnational or city or county level).\n\nThere are two approaches for measuring sustainability: a “goal-oriented approach”,®” which uses\nindicators in the function of a set target (i.e., a value or a range) to measure the current situation of\nsustainable development; and a “relative approach”, which uses indicators to conduct a performance\nassessment in relation to i.e., other cities. Most of indicators are grouped into sustainability aspects\n(i.e., the popularised four sustainability pillars, i.e., economic, environmental, social and\ngovernance)”, and revolve around a set of goals/targets set by government organizations or by a\nlocal sustainability plan. The approach becomes “integrated” if relevant stakeholders were to value\nthe complexity that resides in the interrelation of the sustainability areas being examined, out of\nwhich a sustainability framework is constructed.\n\nIndicators should be representative of the context examined.*? For instance, by tailoring indicators to\nlocal sustainability issues, one avoids under or over-representation in selected aspects of sustainable\ndevelopment and better evaluates the reality of the urban system. Furthermore, to measure the\neffectiveness of an indicator, the latter should be:\n\n“meaningful, easily measurable and understandable, sensitive to a varying space or time,\ncoherent with other selected indicators, concise in summarising complexity, reproducible,\nreliable, calculable for smaller spatial contexts (i.e., neighbourhoods), economically\nconvenient (collection of data should be easy and cheap).” (Ramieri et al., 1998).\n\nSince one indicator cannot satisfy all selection criteria, it is commonly agreed that an indicator needs\nto be locally relevant and measurable (contingent upon availability of data). It is also worth noting\nthat indicators should be frequently verified and updated; update ability is, in fact, important in the\nsense that sustainability aspects are variable and existing issues might be solved over time. A report\nfrom the European Commission?” further highlights the necessity of standardised indicators for\nperformance assessment. In this way, indicator sets can be validated and improved”. However, the\nuse of standardised or universal indicators in some cases might not be representative of small urban\nsystems’”\". In addition, universal sustainability frameworks developed by government agencies might\nhave little consideration for data availability, becoming also unsuitable to smaller contexts.\n\nFurther technicalities to be considered when using sustainability indicators concern the type of\nmeasures to be used. A baseline is usually established at the beginning of measurement, and one\ncould use absolute measures (i.e., annual carbon emissions) or relative measures (i.e., %\nimprovement on carbon emissions from reference year) to make comparisons against the baseline.\n\n96 Klopp, Jacqueline & Petretta, Danielle (2017).
