Consumers want\nto be involved with the products they use or will purchase and have a say in\ntheir features and quality. But in order to create their own products according to\ntheir needs and wishes, they need access to project documentations or tutorials\nthat guide them through the process of making or give them pointers in the right\ndirection.\n\nUnfortunately, the so called makers rarely document their work or provide such\ndocumentations. They lack confidence in their projects or the skills to edit and\npublish the documentation.\n\nTo solve the problem of editing, this thesis proposes formatting guidelines and lay-\nout suggestions for do-it-yourself tutorials and project documentations. In order\nto derive these guidelines and suggestions, semi-structured interviews were con-\nducted with thirteen makers. In these interviews, makers were given the task to\nfind a tutorial on a topic that interest them and were observed during the task exe-\ncution and later on questioned about how they executed it. Those interviews were\nanalyzed qualitatively via coding.\n\nIn addition to the formatting guidelines and layout suggestions, this thesis pro-\nposes a categorization of different documentation consumer types and their ex-\npectations towards project documentations, as well as an overview of the creative\nprocess involved in creating a project.",

Die Verbraucher wollen an den Produkten, die sie\nbenutzen oder erwerben werden, beteiligt sein und ein Mitspracherecht bei deren\nEigenschaften und Qualitat haben. Aber um ihre eigenen Produkte nach ihren\nBediirfnissen und Wiinschen zu gestalten, brauchen sie Zugang zu Projektdoku-\nmentationen oder Tutorials, die sie durch den Herstellungsprozess fiihren oder\nihnen Anregungen in die richtige Richtung geben.\n\nLeider dokumentieren die so genannten Maker ihre Arbeit nur selten oder stellen\nsolche Dokumentationen selten zur Verfiigung. Es fehlt ihnen das Vertrauen\nin ihre Projekte oder die Fahigkeiten, die Dokumentation zu bearbeiten und zu\nver6ffentlichen.\n\nUm das Problem des Editierens zu lésen, werden in dieser Arbeit For-\nmatierungsrichtlinien und Layoutvorschlage fiir do-it-yourself-Tutorials und Pro-\njektdokumentationen vorgeschlagen. Um diese Richtlinien und Vorschlage\nabzuleiten, wurden halbstrukturierte Interviews mit dreizehn Makern gefiihrt. In\nden Interviews wurde den Makern die Aufgabe gestellt, ein Tutorial zu einem fiir\nsie interessanten Thema zu finden und sie wurden bei der Ausfiihrung der Auf-\ngabe beobachtet und spater dazu befragt, wie sie diese ausgefiihrt haben. Diese\nInterviews wurden mittels Coding qualitativ ausgewertet.\n\nZusatzlich zu den Formatierungsrichtlinien und Layoutvorschlagen wird in dieser\nArbeit eine Kategorisierung verschiedener Dokumentationskonsumententypen\nund deren Erwartungen an Projektdokumentationen vorgeschlagen sowie ein\nUberblick iiber den kreativen Prozess bei der Erstellung eines Projekts gegeben.",

This is caused by them\n\nforgetting to document [Tseng and Resnick] [2014|] or be-\n\ncause they do not think their project is good enough or they\nlack the skill to do so [Kuznetsov and Paulos|[2010]].\n\nBut what is a maker and what are their projects? Gen-\nerally speaking, any activity where you create something\nnew counts as making, this includes activities such as cook-\ning, welding, sewing or sculpting [2017],\n[2012]] . In this thesis the term will be used as Dale\nDougherty, the founder of the uses it,\nsince it is the most inclusive definition of maker. He says,\nthe term ’maker” can be applied to each and everyone,\nsince we all make while preparing food, tending to our gar-\ndens or mending clothes [2012}].\nUnderstanding what a maker is and who identifies as one,\nhelps identifying their needs and struggles. During his\nspeech at the Maker Fair in 2014, Adam Savage, an Ameri-\ncan fabricator, educator and very vocal part of the maker\nmovement, said “Humans do two things that make us\nunique from all other animals; we use tools and we tell sto-\nries.” (2014]]. But since makers rarely document\ntheir work and therefore cannot really tell the story of their\nproject and making process, part of this self-expression as\na human comes short. Besides the aspect of self-expression\nthere are other reasons why people make.\n\nThe reasons for making are diverse. Savage describes it as\n\nan urge [Savage| [2012], others see it as an experimental\n\nMakers rarely\ndocument.\n\nEveryone is a maker\nas soon as they\ncreate something\nfrom scratch.\n\nMaking and\ndocumenting the\nproject as\nself-expression.\n\nDiverse reasons why\npeople make.",

Figuring out why people make is relevant since\nit influences the expectations regarding the documentation\nthey use to make their project. Writers of the documen-\ntation have expectations towards how they want to cap-\nture their project and how they wish to present it in the\nend. The consumers of documentation have expectations\ntowards the presentation and content of the documenta-\ntion. Consumers that want to learn might need a bit more\ninformation while consumers that want to rebuild might\njust need the steps leading towards a working end result.\nFiguring out those expectations and what they mean for\nthe writers and their documentation designs is a goal of this\nthesis.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, currently there is a shift towards a do-it-\nyourself (DIY) mindset and maker culture. A look at the\nGoogle and YouTube trends for “DIY” in Figure and\nFigure visualizes this trend of a rise in the search for\nDIY, beginning around 2012. This could be due to the\ngreater accessibility of the Internet for all ages and the\navailability of more and more platforms for knowledge\nexchange, thus resulting in the formation of online com-\nmunities of various sizes heavily involved in DIY one way\n\nor another [Kuznetsov and Paulos]|2010]].

Ideas like recycling and upcycling\nare very present in media right now. This means, people\nwould rather try to repair something broken instead of\nbuying something new, whenever that is a viable solution.\nIn addition to being a more sustainable approach, it is most\noften cheaper or the end result of higher quality, which\nis another reason people might fall back on DIY\n[2017}]. In his talk at the Maker Fair 2012,\nSavage also mentioned something about this trend. He\nsaid, ’We are seeing a generational shift back to Making...\nI’ve built and participated in the building of things from\nscratch: Robots, theater sets, furniture, and props, but\nthe love of the objects themselves, this child’s desire for\nthe impossible toy seen in a movie, or seen in my head.\nWanting to make it, make it something that I have and\nsomething I have held... That want of those things, and\nteaching myself how to make things in order to have them\nis the engine of everything I have achieved in my whole\nlife up till now... It doesn’t matter what you make, and\nit doesn’t matter why. The importance is that you are\nmaking something.” [2012]], this means another\nreason for this trend could be that people want to make\nthings they saw somewhere and own them or use them\nas an opportunity to learn or express themselves in this\nworld. Nowadays, creating bigger, more elaborate projects\nis made possible by the accessibility of tools via maker\nspaces such as Fablabs or in your own home in the form of\n3D printers, microcontrollers, etc.",
    "Page_26": "Sharing via platforms\nlike Instructables or\npersonal blogs. But\n\nthere are different\nmedia types to\nchoose from.\n\nThis thesis strives to\nprovide quality\ncriteria for tutorials\nthrough maker\ninterviews.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe storytelling aspect Savage mentioned in his talk in\n2014 is the focus of this thesis. As already mentioned there\nare several platforms makers can use to share their projects\nor project documentations. These documentations are\nmore often referred to as tutorials and come in the shape\nof videos, texts, pictures or a wild mix. Faced with such an\narray to choose from, the question of what to pick arises.\nAfterwards, there is the problem of how to format the\ntutorial and which information to include and which not.\nAt the end, the decision of which platform to upload the\ntutorial to is quite relevant, since there are different target\naudiences present and layouts required. Available plat-\nforms are for example\nor personal blogs. To our knowledge, there seems to be\nno all-encompassing guideline that helps a maker decide\non all these different things for their tutorial. Some papers\ntried to provide guidelines and formatting suggestions\nfor some tutorial types and those will be discussed in the\n\n[Related Work|part of this thesis.\n\nThe goal of this thesis is to provide answers to the\nquestions, what quality criteria and characteristics of sub-\njectively ”good” tutorials are and what ”good” tutorials are\nto different consumer groups. In order to find these char-\nacteristics, interviews with makers of different experience\nlevels, ages, occupations and nationalities were conducted.\nThis study helps to understand how a maker searched for a\ntutorial with a given project idea. A complete overview of\n\nthe study and its results will be given in the section\nSetup and Results",

There are no met-\nrics to evaluate a documentation’s quality. Some papers\nthough, tried to understand how makers document their\nwork or suggested formats that would yield documenta-\ntions that are more accessible or easier to work with by\nleading to less errors.\n\nThis chapter is split into several sections, covering the top-\n\nics|}why makers make} |how they use documentations]and\nlhow makers document projects\n\n2.1 Why Make?\n\nA visual representation that sums up the most common\n\nreasons for DIY was created by [2011].\nTheir graphic can be seen in Figure It depicts “Market-\nplace Evaluation” and “Identity Enhancement” as the two\nmain motivators.\n\nExisting research on\nmaker motivation to\nmake, how they\nsearch for\ndocumentation and\nhow they use it.\n\nConceptual Model of\nMotivations for DIY.",

    "Page_29": "2.1 Why Make?\n\nin the object you possess. Some of these motivators are\nechoed by other papers, especially the community seeking\naspect will be discussed a bit more in depth later on in this\nsection.\n\nThe notion of fulfillment through craft can be found in\nother research as well. remark in\ntheir paper that study participants mentioned they needed\nDIY as a contrast to their daily work life that involves\nless physical work and draw satisfaction from both the\nrequired design work as well as the more haptic physical\nwork with the materials and tools. They described the\nactivities as having something cathartic or purgative since\nthere is a strong contrast between the violent destruction\nand creating something new.\n\nThe creation aspect of this process was partially described\nas an urge. They saw it as being obsessed with the need\nto create something from scratch and turning material into\nsomething completely different [2009].\nAdditionally, the need for uniqueness was also something\nthey encountered in their study. It was mentioned in the\ncontext of style in Ikea furniture, “Ikea has no style, there\nis style but style is lost when too many people buy the\nsame brand” [Rosner and Bean| [2009]. Participants would\nalter the furniture to make it something more unique and\npersonal, the piece would be an expression of themselves\nand turn into something they made and less something\nmade by Ikea. It almost seems like for some, being creative\nwas not just a trait but a part of their personality they\nneeded to carry outwards and show off to others in the\nform of their projects. Whether or not that rings true for\nevery maker, expressing creativity is a recurring motivator\n\n[Kuznetsov and Paulos|[2010]]\n\nAfter explaining the motivations depicted in Figure the\nnext step is to understand the DIY actions involved. In\norder to do this, we need to understand Wolf and Mc-\nQuitty’s definition of DIY. Their definition is based on the\ntools and materials used. For them, there is a clear dis-\ntinction between Arts and Crafts and DIY since the parts\nare acquirable at different retailers and in completely dif-\nferent price ranges. Thus, DIY becomes a money-walled\nactivity only accessible to those, who have enough finan-\n\nSelf-fulfillment from\nDIY as a motivator.\n\nObsession to make\nas a motivator.\n\nUniqueness of end\nproduct and\nownership of it as a\nmotivator.\n\nWolf and McQuitty’s\n*DIY Behaviors” and\ndefinition of DIY.",

Additionally, they also exclude\nsome crafts by defining DIY projects to “require greater\nlevels of innovation, design, knowledge, skills, and time”\n\n[Wolf and McQuitty| |2011]] than others. This is an alter-\n\nnate approach to the definition as for example the one men-\ntioned by [2010]. For whom DIY\nhas a low barrier of entry since the projects are not very\ncost-intensive and the required knowledge is easily acces-\nsible on the Internet, making it a beginner friendly activity.\nAs already mentioned, this thesis employs DIY and its core\nidea the same way Kuznetsov and Paulos] [2010] use it and\nwould count such activities as cooking and knitting as DIY,\nas compared to{Wolf and McQuitty| [2011 who would ex-\nclude both of those.\n\nHowever, for DIY activities the definition from\nwill from hereon out be used. They define\nit as “activities in which individuals engage raw and semi-\nraw materials and component parts to produce, transform\nor reconstruct material possessions including those drawn\n\nfrom natural environment” [Wolf and McQuitty|[2011]].\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFinding a community to involve yourself in, either in the\nform of actively sharing or simply lurking around and ab-\nsorbing everything from motivation to knowledge and in-\nspiration like a sponge, appears to be an overarching mo-\n(2009), ori)\n[2010 defined a community in this sense as \"a group of\npeople who share common goals and interests - communi-\ncating through mediums online and in person”.\n\nGetting involved with a community comes both with ad-\nvantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, there is a\ndeep well of knowledge readily available as well as a lot\nof support, motivation and inspiration; on the other hand,\nthe prospect of sharing your idea with others is connected\nto a lot of anxiety, either because of considering your own\n\nwork “not good enough” in some way [Kuznetsov and|\n[2010]] or for fear of it being appropriated and thus\n\nit not being unique anymore, lessening your own unique-\n\nness in self-expression ]. Most of\nthe time, the desire to put yourself out there [Rosner and]\n[2009]] or give back to the community [Kuznetsov and)\n2010], Torrey et al.|[2009]] outweighs those fears.",

Similar to a\nswarm of wasps, each of them is an individual with their\nown work but they are only complete in their respective\nhive where they all work together and towards a common\n\ngoal [Rosner and Bean|[2009]].\n\nInteracting with a community is possible in several ways.\nFigure shows the most common contribution types\nsorted by frequency.

These types help to understand what makers\nsearch for in tutorials and, in part, how they use them.\n\nThe first type is the “Guru Seeker”. They seek out experts\nin a DIY domain to learn the right way to make things.\nThey want to have in-depth knowledge on a topic and\nlearn every minute detail there is.\n\n\"The Supporter” behaves exactly as the name implies.\nThey just want to make and support others in their making\nsince making brings them such joy that they want others to",

The other kind of search\nusually starts when running into a problem while making\nthat cannot be solved with the currently available resources\nand needs to be fixed immediately. The two types will\nfrom hereon out be called inspirational search and search\nfor technical information.\n\nSearching for those knowledge types can be done in several\nways, as well. One approach is the keyword search. People\nemploying the keyword search seem to generally be aware\nof its drawbacks and do not expect to get the perfect results\n\n11\n\nUniquists want to\ncontribute novel\nthings.\n\nCore motivations for\nDIY or making and\nDIY as a culture.\n\nDifferent knowledge\ntypes during project:\nInspiration vs\ntechnical information.\n\nDifferent search\ntypes during project:\nKeyword Search vs.\nKnowledge Gifts.",

Another downfall\ncan be the high amount of results a search yields. Filtering\nthose results can be a tedious task. If it is an event that has\nto be done again and again, it can lead to frustration if not a\ncomplete discard of the project or approach it is connected\nto. Another approach is the retrieval of knowledge gifts.\nThis can be done both online and offline and relies on\nthe previously mentioned formation of contacts.

[Torrey et al.| 2009]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n‘Tseng and Resnick| [2014] describes the process of docu-\n\nmenting a project as disruptive. Makers would often find\nthemselves forgetting to document a step and needed to\ndecide whether or not they wanted to start from scratch to\ndocument it or simply ignored the lack of a picture or video\nto illustrate the process. Especially for bigger projects, the\nprospect of having to recreate the step would be daunting\nand bothersome. Overall, the process of documenting\nimpedes the process of making and is thus often neglected\nor ignored. Others are not confident enough in their project\nor creativity and will not document from the get-go\n[2007] making it impossible to change their mind\n\nlater on.\n\n \n\nIf makers still decide to document, they face the decision\nof which media to use for their tutorial.\nmention that makers start the documentation pro-\ncess after finishing their project by creating a timeline and\nthen figuring out how to describe it.

They mention static and\ndynamic tutorials and the viability of a mix of both.\n\nStatic tutorials use texts and pictures making them more\nappealing for visual based learners [2007]. Most of\nthe time, these tutorials are easy to scan since consumers\ncan read the text at their own pace and, depending on the\nformatting, a step-by-step format is employed.\n\nDynamic tutorials are video based and thus more difficult\nto scan as static ones, since handling a video involves\nmore manual actions and depending on how the consumer\nworks with it, steps can be missed easily. A critical benefit\nthat a video offers and a picture alone cannot, is displaying\ncomplex processes or minor context details, e.g. how much\npressure should be applied when using a tool or how to\nhold it in relation to the material.

These rhythms were daily, every\nother day, twice a week, weekly or every other month.\n\nThere were several reasons a participant consumed docu-\nmentation and when in their creative process. Documenta-\ntion was consumed before starting a project to get ideas or\nmotivation or to find a “shopping list” from a project sim-\nilar to the one they had in mind. A “shopping list” in this\ncontext refers to a parts list often found in tutorials that list\nall the required tools and materials for the project.

Two participants would prefer searching for docu-\nmentation at the end of their project since they enjoy get-\nting in the flow of working and do not like interrupting to\nsearch for information or since they want to rely on their\nown skill until the end.\n\nParticipants interacted with documentation in three differ-\nent ways, based on where in their creative process they are\nand why they require a documentation. Those three ways\nof interacting are reading all, nitpicking and skimming.\nNitpicking in this context refers to the action of searching\nfor one specific piece of information. Skimming refers to\nthe act of reading not the whole text but only keywords or\nphrases and shorter segments of text around those. The in-\nteraction types are coined on text based documentation but\nthe concept behind them can also be applied to video based\nones. Since videos were also consumed by the participants,\nthey are also included in these interaction types.\nParticipants would read all of the documentation or watch\nthe complete video for one of three reasons. One reason is\nthat a participant requires guidance for a process or the act\nof building their project. Then a participant would search\nfor a step-by-step documentation and use it to get through\nthe process. Another reason is that a participant watches a\nvideo completely to get an overview of the project or pro-\ncess. The last reason is that a participant would be inter-\nested in the topic and wants to learn more about it or get\ninvolved with it in some way. One participant explained\nthey watch DIY tutorials for entertainment since they enjoy\nwatching people fail at their projects.\n\nParticipants interacted with documentation by nitpicking\nthem when they required solutions for specific problems.\nOne participant mentioned watching video tutorials com-\npletely once and then returning to them for nitpicking cer-\ntain parts they were struggling with or combine with other\n\n21\n\nDocumentation\nduring project to help\nwith problems.\nDocumentation after\nproject to fix errors\nand compare results.\n\nThree different\ninteraction types:\nreading all,\nnitpicking, skimming.\nInteraction depends\non where in creative\nprocess and reason\nbehind interaction.\n\nRead all for\nguidance, to get an\noverview of project or\nprocess, or out of\ninterest.\n\nNitpicking to\novercome specific\nproblem.",

Another reason for skimming is\nthat participants wanted to recreate the project without re-\nlying on the documentation completely. They wanted to\nget a brief glance of the steps involved and then recreate it\nfrom memory without all the help and details.\n\nFor the interviews, documentations were separated into\ntwo different categories, process documentations and step-\nby-step documentations. Process documentations were\nsummarized as highly detailed documentations that in-\nclude failures along the way of completing the project, dis-\ncussions of the different approaches, if there were alterna-\ntive approaches to be considered, and maybe “extra” in-\nformation or knowledge that is related to the topic but not\nrelevant for the execution of the project. Step-by-step doc-\numentation were described as documentations that did not\noffer all the “extra” information along the way but only in-\ncluded the relevant steps to complete the project and how\nto execute them.\n\nParticipants who already have knowledge or experience in\nthe domain of the project preferred step-by-step documen-\ntations. They explained that this documentation type is eas-\nier to navigate and thus easier to nitpick from. Addition-\nally, they also mentioned that they appreciated the short\nand precise explanations more than long and detailed ones.\nParticipants with little knowledge or experience in the do-\nmain preferred process documentation. This was also the\ncase with participants that were simply interested in the\ntopic a documentation is about. The process documenta-\ntion would enable the consumer to understand what was\ndone in the project and why things were done that way.\nParticipants mentioned that this helped them follow the tu-\ntorial. Moreover, participants mentioned that they appreci-\nated the additional knowledge that is usually not included\nin step-by-step documentations since they can use it in fu-\nture projects and it might enable them to realize bigger and\nbetter projects.",

Additionally, participants mentioned their\n\ninterests and what they would enjoy doing. This phase\nwould end with them deciding on one or several topics\nthey would look into. Then a participant would either\nstart by searching some type of reference or by directly\nsearching for a tutorial to follow. In this context reference\nrefers to a picture of the product; a tutorial on the project\ntopic; the product in an online store to set a price limit for\nthe project; or material on process knowledge.

Depending on the results\nthe participant might have to adapt and refine their search\nterms if the search did not yield what they were looking\nfor or if it yielded way too many results and they had to\nnarrow it down, this behavior was tracked in refining\nsearch terms. After sighting the results, the considering\nand planning phase would start. The participant might\nhave to consider different approaches to their project or\ntypes of projects, tracked in considering, and then plan\nby using various tutorials. Some participants took their\nown notes and stated that they would work off of these\nrather than the tutorials they decided on. The last step\nwas to gather all the materials and tools the project would\nrequire.\n\nTo search for information or tutorials or an\nequivalent like was used more often than\n[YouTube| (38 coded segments vs. 4; 90,42% vs. 9,52%). The\ncodes scanning textbased links (40), looking at\nvideo results (16) and scanning \"to buy\"-links\n(7) were used to track what types of results the partici-\npants were interested in. These codes were applied if it\nwas clear which of the search results the participant was\nlooking at, whereas scanning results was applied if\nit was unclear. This means, out of the 63 coded segments\nabout 63,49% (40) were textbased, a quarter video were\nbased with 25,29% (16) and 11,11% (11) were links to\nshopping websites where you could buy the searched\nobject. Searches for pictures occurred about three times\nand were not tracked separately, but were included in the\ncode searching reference (33). Only one participant\nconducted their search for a tutorial mostly via picture\nresults.\n\nAdditionally, it was tracked if a participant was interested\nin tutorials recommended by the website they are currently\nbrowsing via the code checking out recommended\n(22) and if they follow a recommended video clicking\nrecommended video (3).\n\n27\n\nGoogle search (38)\nvs YouTube searches\n(4).

If avail-\nable and the participant was interested in the content, they\nwould watch the video preview of a tutorial rather than just\nlook at the thumbnail.\n\nInteractions with text tutorials and video tutorials were\ntracked separately. Additionally, it was tracked whether\na participant was skimming text (117) or reading\n(72) and whether they were skipping through video\ntutorial (68) or watching video tutorial (80).\nComparing these codes, it becomes apparent that the codes\nrefer to an interaction with a text based tutorial 189 out of\n337 coded segments (about 56%) and a video based one 148\ntimes (about 44%). Another medium that can be consid-\nered is the picture medium, tracked by the code looking\nat picture. This code occurred 161 times and was the\nthird most occurring code. When considering all codes in-\ndicating interaction with a medium, there are 498 coded\nsegments. Text based interaction hold the biggest share\nwith 189 segments (about 37,95%), then picture with 161\nsegments (about 32,32%) and lastly videos with 161 (about\n29,71%).\n\nA tutorial text was skimmed or a video skipped through if\na participant did not read or watch the whole tutorial but\nskipped over passages, read only words around keywords\nor skipped through sections in a video by moving around\nthe cursor on the progress bar. The codes indicate that tu-\ntorials were skimmed 185 times (about 55%) and actively\nread or watched 152 times (about 45%) out of 337 coded\nsegments. Texts were skimmed more often (117 segments,\n62%) than read (72 segments, 38%); whereas videos were\nwatched (80 segments, 54%) more than skipped through (68\nsegments, 46%).\n\nAdditionally, the code skimming tutorial was used if\na participant scrolled through a text based tutorial and\nvery briefly glanced at pictures or skimmed over text with-\nout reading passages aloud or discussing pictures. This\ncode was the fourth most common code with a count of\n152 coded segments. This means, whole tutorials were\nskimmed as often as they were actively read or watched",
    "Page_51": "3.2 Semi-Structured Maker Interviews\n\naccording to the coded segments, disregarding the distinct\ncodes for skimming passages of text and skipping through\nvideo segments.\n\nInteraction with the infobox of a video was tracked through\nthe code skimming infobox. This code occurred 22\ntimes (0,99% of total coded segments) and was often used\nin the context of a participant searching for knowledge on\nthe materials used in the tutorial or while the maker intro-\nduced themselves at the start of a video.\n\nIn addition to the more physical process, the emotional\nstate of the participant was tracked through process\ncodes. A code was applied if a participant had a visible or\naudible reaction, this means, only strong reactions were\ntracked. Codes relating to the emotional state are feeling\nunhappy/unsatisfied (50), being/feeling lost\n(28) and feeling happy/satisfied (19).\n\nThe code relating to a participant’s unhappiness or dis-\nsatisfaction often occurred when a participant could not\nfind the information they were looking for. For example,\na tutorial they were interacting with was not contain-\ning information they needed or were on a wrong topic.\nParticipants were prone to reacting unhappy when they\nhave been searching for a fitting tutorial or information on\nsomething for a longer time. Lacking information, visuals\nor details; broken links; and subjectively bad formatting\nthen resulted in a stronger negative reaction than similar\n“issues” would have created earlier on in their search.\nbeing/feeling lost often occurred when a participant\nmisunderstood the information presented in a tutorial or\nthey experienced a complete lack of information and had\nno clue where and how to search for it.

This also happened if the material\nused in a step was not described in enough detail and the\nparticipant was left to figure out themselves what was\nused and how.

This led to them to not understanding what\nwas being referenced in a tutorial and not knowing how to\napproach a search regarding that term. A feeling of being\nlost was not only caused by the tutorial content, but also\nby the web page the participants interacted with. In some\nsituations the participants were not sure how to interact\nwith the web page or could not figure out how to access a\ntutorial at all.\n\nThe lack of information, misunderstanding informa-\ntion and understanding information was _ tracked\nin the codes wondering (180), understanding\n(85), wanting/searching Knowledge (10) and\nmisunderstanding (5). wondering was the most\ncommon code and occurred in various situations as well\nas throughout the whole search process. It was not only\nrelated to the content of a tutorial but also to the general\nprocess of planning the project and interacting with the\nInternet or a website.

The expression domain\nrefers to a field of handicrafts, such as knitting, Arduino\nwiring and programming, sewing, woodcraft, etc. While\nobserving the participants, it became apparent that they\ncould be categorized into three different types of users.\nThe first type can be classified as an absolute beginner.\nThose types of users do not have any type of DIY expe-\nrience at all. They do not tinker at home, they do not\nhave personal projects they work on and are not involved\nin handicraft of any type. They might not have any con-\nfidence in their own skill, as was the case with one par-\nticipant. This participant required detailed descriptions of\nthe process, an indication of the tutorial’s difficulty level\nor else they would rely on their own assumptions, which\nwere faulty every time unprocessed wood was involved\nand precise step outline to follow. A different participant\nwas also a beginner, but highly impatient and critical of the\ntutorial they consumed. This participant was more confi-\ndent in their skill than the other one and tended to skim the\ntutorial instead of spending time to understand the process\nand materials involved. They did not appreciate detailed\ndescriptions and missed pieces of information because of\ntheir impatient skimming. Skimming in this context refers\nto the action of reading keywords or short phrases of text\nand a couple words around those but not reading the com-\nplete text.\nThe second type of user is a novice with basic knowledge\nabout DIY projects. Those users do not require as highly de-\ntailed descriptions as the absolute beginner might require\nthem since they already have some experience in the DIY\ndomain. They appreciate a slimmed down and straightfor-\nward description of the process with links to resources they\ncan use to inform themselves about background informa-\ntion or alternative ways to perform a step. The overall tone\nof the tutorial can be a bit more technical since the user can\nbe assumed to have experience with processes common in\nthis domain (e.g. soldering in an electrical domain).\nThe last user type is the domain expert. Those users\nconsider themselves very knowledgeable about the do-\nmain they DIY in and tinker regularly or have done many\nprojects. These users are critical of the tutorial they con-\nsume since they have experience to compare a tutorial’s in-",

When asked about why they turned\nto text based tutorials the participants said that video tu-\ntorials are difficult to scan for information and navigate.\nMoreover, they disliked not being able to work at their\nown pace since video based tutorials would set the pace\nat which information is given to them and they are not able\nto scan forward as they would be with a text based tutorial.\nIn spite of this, some participants still favored video based\ntutorials. These participants described themselves as vi-\nsual learners that require to see other people doing the pro-\ncess or as people that had a difficult time reading texts and\ndrawing information out of them.\n\nBecause of this, both video based tutorials and text based\ntutorials can be recommended as a medium, writers should\nbe aware that by choosing one medium they might lose a\npotential viewer group. To address the most consumers, a\nmixed tutorial offers itself as a medium. Those tutorials are\ntext based, but additionally use short videos to support the\nexplanation process.\n\nDuring their search, participants would visit websites\nadvertising numerous ways to realize a project (e.g.\n[DIY Desk Lamp You Can Make By Yourself). Those visits\nwere tracked in the code scanning x featured site\n(11). Those websites usually feature a project thumbnail or\npicture, the project title and sometimes a short explanation\nwhat it is about. In addition to the participants’ behavior\nwhile scanning search results, how they scanned those\nwebsites helped getting an understanding of how partici-\npants decided which pages to access.\n\nDepending on the type of person and the layout of the\npage, both picture and text were reviewed. Three out of\neleven times only the picture or thumbnail was used to\ndiscern what the tutorial is about and whether or not it\nwould be useful to the participant. In three other instances,\nthe participant started reading the project titles as well\nas viewing the thumbnail, but stopped reading the titles\nafter three to nine featured projects. The title was read four\nout of 11 times. In those instances the title was positioned\nabove the picture and in a bigger font than the rest of\nthe website, so that it was “easy” to read or catch while",

Two participants scrolled\nback up actively to read the title when the project was\ninteresting or “unconventional” or when they were unsure\nof the material used in the thumbnail. Figure [4.1] depicts a\nproject from a x featured website that has a clearly visible\ntitle and an “unconventional” project idea. Additional de-\nscriptions were skipped and in one instance the description\nonly appeared while hovering over the thumbnail which\nannoyed the participant and they did not use it actively to\nview a description. Participants were more likely to view\nonly the thumbnails or pictures if they were impatient or\nhad spent a lot of time searching for something already.\nHow long ”a lot of time” was depended heavily on the\nparticipant and could vary from five minutes to 20 minutes.\n\nThe codes watching preview (21) and looking at\nthumbnail (13) were used to track participant interaction\nwith thumbnails and previews. Previews in this context\nwere animated thumbnails or video previews. In addition\nto those codes, the code scanning x featured site\nalso counts towards thumbnail interaction and helps un-\nderstand how participants used them to gather information\nabout a tutorial’s content.\n\nEleven out of thirteen times, the thumbnail was used to find\nprojects with a fitting design or correct type. One time,\nthe thumbnail of a video tutorial showed the wiring of a\nproject and this display was used to discern the difficulty\nof the setup and whether or not the participant would be\nable to realize this project with little help of the tutorial or if\nthey needed additional information and should watch the\nvideo. One participant used the thumbnail of a video tu-\ntorial, which displayed a spice rack on the right side and a\nmessy cupboard on the left, to discern if the tutorial would\nbe interesting and fitting for their use. The participant\nfound the design of the rack very appealing and compared\ntheir own messy cupboard to the displayed one, mention-\ning how their own was even worse. These interactions with\nthe thumbnail imply that a display of the project’s design is\nvery important.

Considering this, a\npreview gives a viewer more information about the tutorial\nand is more likely to be used in order to access information\nabout the tutorial than a short description, but should not\ncontain tools that are not absolutely vital to the project as\nthey could deter viewers if they are too expensive or diffi-\ncult to access.\n\nInteracting with the Tutorial\n\nIn text tutorials participants interacted with tutorial statis-\ntics twice, as can be seen in the code checking tutorial\nstats (2). Tutorial statistics in this context are statistics for\nthe tutorial’s costs, duration and difficulty rating.

This means,\npictures should be self-explanatory in case the viewer\ndoes not interact with the description. Pictures can be\nmade self-explanatory by adding text to the picture itself\nor by the way it is taken. Figure shows an example\nof a self-explanatory picture. The tutorial the picture is\ntaken from, is an example for a tutorial where a participant\nwould skim the pictures and dismiss the text, as the font\nis small compared to the pictures and in a color, that is\nnot clearly visible against the background. And thus,\nit is important to have mostly self-explanatory pictures.\nAnother way to achieve a so called higher information\ncontent would be to use picture series, gifs or short (10-30\nseconds) videos instead. Those media types are especially\npractical to display processes or interaction sequences.\nParticipants that did not read a picture’s description or\nthe step related to the picture tended to launch into states\nof wondering and lost time, trying to figure out the\ninformation themselves instead of reading the tutorial.\n\nVideo tutorials can also be segmented into an introductory\npart and a main body.

The process involved in creating the project\nshould be segmented into steps and those steps then\ndiscussed in the tutorial. The tutorial should support a\ntimestamp feature so a viewer can jump to a certain step\nand have an overview of the whole process. This makes\nthe tutorial easier to skim and work with since the user can\nkeep track of where they currently are in the process more\neasily. A participant skipped through the tutorial if they\nwere familiar with the execution of a step, the explanations\nfor the step were too long, they had to backtrack since\nthey missed something or were unsure about something\nthat had happened in a different part of the video. These\nskips would be made more precise thus causing a viewer\nto miss less of the content if a timestamp feature would\nbe included in the video or the steps would be shown in\nthe video itself in the form of a textual overlay. Another\nimportant thing one participant mentioned is that the steps\nshould be in chronological order, detailed enough to not\ncause misunderstandings and not contradict themselves.\nIn one video they watched, the maker glued pieces of\nwood on the top of a construction and did not make it clear\nthat certain pieces should not be fixed because of screws\nthat need to be inserted in a later step, this caused the\nparticipant to be confused and a bit wary of the maker’s\nexplanations for the rest of the tutorial.\n\nGathering Materials and Tools\n\nThe last step in the process is to gather all the materials.\nIn order for the participant to do this they require some\nkind of parts list.

Mate-\nrials in this case are parts that are consumed in the process\nand tools ones that are reusable.

The makers were given\nthe task to find a tutorial to one of four suggested topics,\nthose topics being Arduino weather station, side table,\ndesk lamp and a project of their own choosing, and were\nasked follow-up questions regarding their task execution\nafter finishing the task. The makers’ creative process,\nfrom the conception of their project idea to figuring out\nwhich materials to use and planning the building process,\nand how the process of finding a subjectively appropriate\ntutorial was analyzed by coding the interview recordings.\nProcess codes were used to track actions and evaluation\ncodes to track the participants’ opinions, impressions and\nsuggestions. Based on those codes, suggestions for tutorial\ndesign were made and tutorial users classified.\n\nThe codes indicate that tutorial consumers’ needs and ex-\npectations for the tutorials are diverse as the makers com-\n\n63\n\nThesis analyzed\nmakers’ creative\nprocess for finding a\nproject they want to\nmake by coding 13\nsemi-structured\nmaker interviews.\n\nMakers’ expectations\ntowards tutorials\ndiverse.",

Tutorials can try to cater to both\nmedia types by embedding video tutorials in text tutorials,\nbut appealing to both beginners and domain experts would\nbe difficult, as switching the way the tutorial is written can-\nnot be achieved easily.\n\nOne way to appeal to both beginners and domain experts\nis to offer a step-by-step tutorial that links to other tutori-\nals that explain required knowledge or background knowl-\nedge without adding all the detail to one step or add those\ndetails into the tutorial margin.\n\nMoreover, consumers wish for tutorials to be easily naviga-\nble and easy to skim. This can be achieved by using out-\nlines, timecodes and considering how to format the tuto-\nrial. For the general tutorial structure, the results indicated\nthat a tutorial should have an introduction that gives an\noverview of the project and its looks and requirements both\nin knowledge and parts; a main body that has a step-by-\nstep format with visuals in the form of pictures, videos or\ngif; and an ending that summarizes the project and shows\noff the end result.\n\nThe contributions of this thesis are the qualitative analysis\nof makers’ behavior regarding tutorial selection and its re-\nsults in the form of design suggestions.\n\n5.2 Future Work\n\nIn the future it could be analyzed whether or not the sug-\ngested format supports the user in their searching process\nand working process. As the results indicate the existence\nof different user types, future research could discern if this\nsuggested format works for all user types or if a more spe-\ncific format for each type needs to be designed.\n\nsuggested a recipe like approach to tu-\ntorials that incorporates some of the participants wishes for\nless detailed and parts orientated tutorials.

By creating a database of tutorials\nand keywords, the platform could suggest Wikipediatlike\ntooltips to include and links to other tutorials that contain\ninformation for beginners in the domain. This means the\nwriter could focus on creating the relevant steps for the tu-\ntorial and not search for related knowledge to link to or in-\nclude, to make the tutorial understandable for beginners.\nNonetheless, makers should be able to browse tutorials by\nkeywords or statistics such as costs, duration and difficulty.\nAnd thus, a writer should be suggested such keywords to\ntag their tutorial and be able to add statistics to it.\n\nAs participants wished for videos to be offered together\nwith text tutorials, such a platform should allow to em-\nbed YouTube] videos or upload and easily segment shorter\nvideos unrelated to YouTube, Additionally, the platform\nshould include the uploading of pictures and gifs.\n\nDue to the maker community being diverse and active, a\nplatform should allow for collaborative working. Makers\nshould be able to review and comment on the work of other\npeople. A way to add notes to a tutorial or contribute to it\nshould be present to keep tutorials up to date and feel like\na part of the community.

This means you need to have both a working webcam and a working microphone. If either is an\nissue for you, please try to acquire both beforehand or notify me so we can cancel your participation and I\ncan look for a replacement participant.\n\nIf you have a problem with being seen on camera or with me recording, please tell me and we can can-\ncel your participation in the study, but please notify me of this so I can organise a replacement participant.\n\nIn order to have a smooth session, a stable internet connection is crucial. If the connection breaks down, we\nstill have your recording but the flow of the session is interrupted and you might have a difficult time getting\nback into it. The disk space is relevant to capture the recording to have a backup in case the connection\nbreaks down.\n\nAfter the session, I will ask you to upload the recordings, as well as notes you took (if you took notes on\npaper, please provide pictures). This might take a while and does not have to be done during the session,\nbut please do upload the data so I can evaluate it. I will provide you with the link during the session.\n\n2 Software Setup\n\nTo have an online meeting and record the screen, your webcam and the audio please install the following\nsoftware before the meeting:\n\ne Zoom (https: //zoom.us/support/download)\n\nZoom is free, and you do not need an account in order to use it. I will create a meeting for you to join and\nwill send you an invitation beforehand.\n\n3 Personal Setup\n\nPlease keep in mind that you are being recorded, so please remove any personal items from the viewable\nregion if you do not want them to be seen and if you share your home with someone else, notify them\nas well that you are recorded and they maybe should not wander into the room during that time. It will\nalso be beneficial to the study as you will not be disturbed by them during the session and kicked out of flow.\n\nPlease turn off your desktop notifications and hide your desktop icons for your own privacy. If there is\nanything sensitive in your browser history, consider clearing it, as I might ask you to open it to go over the\nwebsites you visited during the session. This would also prevent suggestions when you enter characters into\nyour browser.\n\nAdditionally, prepare some water and snacks for you to consume during the study whenever you need\nto.",

In order to do so, they upload a tutorial on how to recreate their piece. In the long run, we\nwant to help makers along with the documentation process.\n\nBut in order to create such help, we need to understand how users pick the tutorials they wish to follow.\nAre certain tutorial types preferable? Do people prefer entertainment focused tutorials or technical ones?\nWhat are people looking for?\n\n1.2 Aim\nThe aim of this study is to find out:\ne What are characteristics for the quality of maker project documentation?\ne How does experience influence the documentation selection?\n\ne What are the different project phases?\n\n— Do they require different types of knowledge (e.g. procedural vs. factual)?\n\n \n\ne What are the different sources users inquire during the ideation phase?\n\n1.3 Task\n\nThe participant is asked to choose a project from four suggested topics, those topics were a (desk) lamps,\nan Arduino weather station, a side table and a project of their own choosing . Then they have to find a\nfitting project documentation/tutorial they would follow were they to actually build this object. There are\nno limitations set where they can find this tutorial, they can use the whole Internet and are free to browse.\nNo time limitation since it could influence people - pressure participants into picking a tutorial they’re not\nsatisfied with.\n\n1.4 Participants\n\nThe participant group should be heterogeneous since the target maker community is a diverse and hetero-\ngeneous group.\n\n1.5 Experimental Design\n\nThe experiment is a user observation with a semi-structured interview.\n\n1.6 Apparatus\n\nThe participant is positioned in front of their computer screen and has opened the zoom client, a browser\nof their choosing and, if wished, a text document for note taking.\n\nIf the participant wished to do so for privacy reasons, the browser was freshly installed or the browser history\ndeleted and the desktop icons and notifications turned off.\n\nThe participant has their audio and video feed turned on and is sharing their screen so that the observer can\nfollow the participant’s interaction with the device. This data will also be recorded for further evaluation.\nIn order to not distract the participant, the observer has their audio feed turned off and only turns it on if\nthe participant has a question that needs to be answered immediately and is linked to the task execution.\nBefore the task execution the participant was asked whether or not they would like the observer to keep\ntheir video feed turned on, if they do not wish it to be on, the feed will be cut and turned on again after\nthe task execution for the follow-up questions.",

The session started\nby:\n\nGreeting the participant\n\ne Ask them if they’re well\n\nThank them for participating\n\nExplaining this session is for finding a tutorial the second for virtually conducting it\n\nExplaining that the session will now start with a short introduction to the study that will answer most\nquestions\n\nEvery participant was read the following introductory text in either German or English:\n\nThank you very much for finding the time to participate.\nI sent you a PDF for the technical setup in advance, did everything work out well or are there still problems\nat the moment?\n\nYour task today will be to build one of four DIY projects, I will introduce the topics at the end of the\nexplanation. You can choose to build the project for yourself or as a gift for someone else. You can\npersonalize the project according to your favorite theme like a movie or a character. You can choose one\nof the four projects immediately and search for tutorials for that project only or you can start by reading\nabout all four projects and then choose one afterwards.\n\nThe idea of the study is that you are looking for a project tutorial to work with. To do this, you can search\nthe entire Internet and use any medium (video, text, image, etc). (It doesn’t matter if the tutorial is in\nEnglish or German, both are allowed.) It doesn’t have to be just one tutorial at the end, if you know right\naway that you need additional tutorials for one step, you can search for them (example: You could tell me\n*In this step I have to solder, but I don’t know how to do that, I need a tutorial for that too, so I will\nsearch for one now). I also ask you to figure out ways to acquire the materials and tools you would need to\nget to carry out the project. If the costs would be a criterion for you to choose the project, please consider\nthem here in your selection as well. Things you already have on site, you wouldn’t have to re-buy, so you\ndon’t have to look for them. The materials and tools are necessary for the second part of the study, which\nsimulates the construction of the project. In the second session we will do a cognitive walkthrough of the\ninstructions, we will go through step by step how you would recreate this project, which tools would be used\nto work on which material, and what you would have to pay attention to. More details will be given during\nthe second session.\n\nBy the end of this session you should have web pages for the following things:\n\ne The tutorials you will work with\ne shopping possibilities for all materials\ne shopping possibilities for all tools\n\nIf you don’t find any instructions at the end because you don’t like anything at all, then that’s fine and a\nvalid result for the study.\n\nThe study is in the so-called Think-Aloud style, which means I will act as a silent observer and you will have\nto share your thoughts all the time. If important questions need to be answered during the task execution,\nyou can ask them, otherwise just try to ignore me and concentrate on finding your project. It is really\nimportant that you share all your thoughts with me, no matter how unimportant they may seem to you,",

Also, I ask you to always position the mouse where you are looking at the page,\nso I can estimate where your focus is and if there are any connection errors. For example, if you are just\nreading while not moving or talking, it looks to me as if the connection is broken and I would talk to you\nafter a while to check if there is really a problem.\n\nIf you are satisfied with your choice for a tutorial and gathered the materials, I will ask a few questions\nafterwards.\n\nThere is no time limit for this study, it takes as long as it takes.\n\nAny questions?\n\n‘You can take breaks during the study if you need them.
