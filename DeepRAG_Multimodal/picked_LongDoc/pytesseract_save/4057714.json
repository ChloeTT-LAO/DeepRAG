The overall goal in its development\nwas to explore the relationship between how society portrays and promotes drug use, and the\nproblems that arise for individuals and society at large. This includes all drug types - tobacco, alcohol,\npharmaceuticals, and illegal drugs. The module is based upon the premise that the effective promotion\nof healthy living including prevention, treatment, and harm reduction approaches to drug problems\nshould include both demand-side prevention and supply-side prevention. The former consists of\npopulation-targeted interventions that attempt to reduce the demand for drug products by individuals.\nThis includes initiatives that foster an evidence-based understanding of drugs and their actions,\npersonal awareness, responsibility, resiliency, and self-esteem as strategies to encourage any\ncombination of abstinence, moderation, or otherwise safer drug use. The commonality is that the onus\nis placed upon the individual to regulate personal drug use. Demand-side interventions comprise a\nworthwhile, but insufficient, approach to a comprehensive drug strategy.",
    "Page_4": "Introduction: Context for\n“Drug Promotion, Drug Problems”\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA comprehensive approach must also address how society supplies drugs concurrently with the\ndemand. Supply-side interventions address a wide variety of considerations such as product integrity\nand safety during manufacturing, methods of product promotion through advertising or depictions in\npop culture, and ultimate availability through retail configuration - both legal and clandestine. Finally, a\nsupply-side approach must also address how well government regulates all of these supply-side\naspects, through policy and enforcement. In contrast to demand-side prevention, the supply-side\napproach extends expectations of preventing drug problems to drug, media, and entertainment\nindustries. It also includes expectations of government in communicating a public health priority to\nthese industries, reinforcing those communications with policy and law, and consistently and\nmeaningfully enforcing those laws.",

Drugs alleviate or prevent\nunwanted physical and psychological sensations or conditions. That is, they can make us feel better, or at least\nless miserable for a short period of time. Drugs also facilitate social interaction. This could be sharing a bottle of\nwine over dinner, going for a drink with teammates after a game, going outside with colleagues for a cigarette\nduring a work break, sharing a prescription with someone who has symptoms similar to ones for which you were\nprescribed the medication, or sharing a joint at a concert, or sharing a needle to inject crystal meth. Some of\nthese drug-using behaviours are widely-regarded as glamourous or cool, while others are more stigmatized, but\nthey all possess an important social component. Drugs also create many jobs in the alcohol, tobacco, and\npharmaceutical industries - in research, manufacturing, marketing, as well as in their associated retail outlets.\nSales of these various drugs generate substantial revenue for these industries, a portion of which finds its way\ninto government coffers through taxation. These taxes are used to help fund many things such as universities,\nhospitals, and drug treatment and prevention programs.

As we will see in the ‘Prevalence’ section of this module, itis the drugs\nthat are most readily available legally that are associated with the greatest burden of drug-related\nproblems.

Many people are surprised to learn that, like alcohol, tobacco is one of our\nmost significant drug problems. It was not that long ago that pharmacies in Ontario Canada sold cigarettes, and at\na time when they were attempting to brand themselves as a community health service. Public health authorities\nwere quick to point out the disconnect between that aspiration and the sale of a product that had become iconic of\nan unhealthy lifestyle. The vintage image seen here includes an interesting indication of the controversy at the\ntime. Note the ‘community service award' strategically nestled on the top shelf, just left of centre (below the green\narrow). Eventually, tobacco products were removed from pharmacies. You have no doubt also noticed that these\n“power-walls’, as they are called in the tobacco marketing business, have since been covered up in convenience\nstores within drawers.

However, forensic analysis\nshowed that the only substance detected in the blood stream of the perpetrator was THC, suggesting\nthat he had used cannabis, not bathsalts. More recently, there was a great deal of media attention to a\ndrug known as ‘krokodil’. The actual drug name is desomorphine, a strong and fast-acting analgesic -\nfrequently cut with a variety of toxic substances.

Perhaps most bizarre is the Cane Toad which secretes a substance through the pores of its\nskin that, when ingested, provides some people with hallucinogen-like effects.

The\nmovement is not always unidirectional. For a given individual, there may be back and forward\nmovement over the course of their lives. A school reunion may provide an opportunity to reconnect\nwith former acquaintances and behaviours, and some people will move back towards the riskier end of\nthe continuum, but probably only for a few days.

Also note how the name of the wine in ‘Introducing Crush Midnight Cab’ is revealed by\npeeling back the surface layer of the ad. Could this be symbolic for introducing oneself after deploying the\nsuperficial pick-up line ? There may be more play on the name of this wine. ‘Cab’ is often used in wine\nappreciation circles as an abbreviation for cabernet sauvignon, the grape varietal from which this particular wine\nproduct is made. But might ‘Cab’ also be a reference to the mode of transport used at midnight to get to ‘your\nplace or mine’ ? I’m reminded of an anecdote in which a man approaches a woman in a club: “So, how do you\nlike your eggs in the morning.” The woman, deadpan, replies, “Unfertilized”. I'm deliberately reading a lot into this\nad, perhaps too much, to make the point that there is always a challenge in knowing how much to read into the\nads. It is true that many ads are meticulously designed, with multiple levels of intended meaning. But, like an\nirresistible Rorschach test, it is also tempting for us to project our own personal affectations onto the ads. That, in\nitself, is a powerful strategy for engaging consumers.",

The calligraphy on the bottle\nhas an almost Elizabethan look to it, perhaps suggesting a Shakespearean theatrical production.\nRoses are also a symbol for romance. (J ust check out the prices around Valentine’s day.) So maybe\nthere is a celebration of another kind of ‘performance’ intended as well. Note that the roses are out of\nfocus which suggests movement.
