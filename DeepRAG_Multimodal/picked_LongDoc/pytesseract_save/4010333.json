Utility openings such as ducts and vents shall be smaller than man-\npassable (96 square inches). An opening larger than 96 square inches (and over 6 inches in its\nsmallest dimension) that enters or passes through an open storage area shall be hardened in\naccordance with Military Handbook 1013/1A (Reference (at)).\n\n2. IDS STANDARDS\n\na IDS Purpose. An IDS shall detect an unauthorized penetration into the secured area. An\nIDS shall be installed when results of a documented risk assessment determine its use as a\nsupplemental control is warranted, in accordance with Enclosure 3, sections 3 and 4 of this\nVolume, and use is approved by the activity head. When used, all areas that reasonably afford\naccess to the security container or areas where classified data is stored shall be protected by IDS\n\nunless continually occupied. An IDS complements other physical security measures and consists\nof:\n\n(1) Intrusion detection equipment (IDE).\n\n(2) Security forces.\n\n(3) Operating procedures.\n\nb. System Functions\n\n(1) IDS components operate as a system with four distinct phases:\n(a) Detection.\n(b) Communications.\n(c) Assessment.\n(d) Response.\n\n(2) These elements are equally important, and none can be eliminated if an IDS is to\nprovide an acceptable degree of protection.\n\n(a) Detection. During the detection phase, a detector or sensor senses and reacts to\nthe stimuli it is designed to detect. The sensor alarm condition is then transmitted over cabling\nlocated within the protected area to the premise control unit (PCU). The PCU may service many\nsensors. The PCU and the sensors it serves comprise a zone at the monitor station (i.e., an\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 46 APPENDIX TO ENCLOSURE 3",
    "Page_47": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\nalarmed zone).\n\n(b) Communications. The PCU receives signals from all sensors in a protected area\nand incorporates these signals into a communication scheme. An additional signal is added to\nthe communication for supervision to prevent compromise of the communication scheme (i.e.,\ntampering or injection of false information by an intruder). The supervised signal is sent by the\nPCU through the transmission link to the monitor station. Inside the monitor station either a\ndedicated panel or central processor monitors information from the PCU signals. When an alarm\nOccurs, an annunciator generates an audible and visible alert to security personnel. Alarms result\nnonmally from intrusion, tampering, component failure, or system power failure.\n\n(c) Assessment. The assessment period is the first phase that requires human\ninteraction. When alarm conditions occur, the operator assesses the situation and dispatches the\nresponse force.\n\n(d) Response. The response phase begins as soon as the operator assesses an alarm.\ncondition. A response force shall immediately respond to all alarms. The response phase shall\nalso determine the precise nature of the alarm and take all measures necessary to safeguard the\nsecure area.\n\nc. Acceptability of Equipment: All IDE must be Underwniters Laboratories (UL)-listed (or\nequivalent) and approved by the DoD Component. Govemmoent installed, maintained, or\nfumished systems are acceptable.\n\nd. Transmission and Annunciation\n\n(1) Transmission Line Security. When the transmission line leaves the facility and\ntraverses an uncontrolled area, Class I or Class II line supervision shall be used.\n\n(a) ClassI. Class I security is achieved through the use of Data Encryption Standard\nor an algorithm based on the cipher feedback or cipher block chaining mode of encryption.\nCertification by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology or another independent\ntesting laboratory is required.\n\n(b) Class II. Class II line supervision refers to systems in which the transmission is\nbased on pseudo-random generated tones or digital encoding using an interrogation and response\nscheme throughout the entire communication, or UL Class AA line supervision. The signal shall\nnot repeat itself within a minimum 6-month period. Class II security shall be impervious to\ncompromise using resistance, voltage, current, or signal substitution techniques.\n\n(2) Intemal Cabling. The cabling between the sensors and the PCU shall be dedicated to\nIDE and shall comply with national and local code standards.\n\n(3) Entry and/or Access Control Systems. If an entry and/or access control system is\n\nintegrated into an IDS, reports from the automated entry and/or access control system shall be\nsubordinate in priority to reports from intrusion alarms.\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 47 APPENDIX TO ENCLOSURE 3",
    "Page_48": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\n(4) Maintenance Mode. When the alarm zone is placed in the maintenance mode, this\ncondition shall be signaled automatically to the monitor station. The signal shall appear as an\nalam or maintenance message at the monitor station and the IDS shall not be securable while in\nthe maintenance mode. The alarm or message shall be continually visible at the monitor station\nthroughout the period of maintenance. A standard operating procedure shall be established to\naddress appropriate actions when maintenance access is indicated at the panel. All maintenance\npeniods shall be archived in the system. A self-test feature shall be limited to one second per\noccurrence.\n\n(5) Amnunciation of Shunting or Masking Condition. Shunting or masking of any\nintemal zone or sensor shall be appropriately logged or recorded in archive. A shunted or\nmasked intemal zone or sensor shall be displayed as such at the monitor station throughout the\npexiod the condition exists whenever there is a survey of zones or sensors.\n\n \n\n(6) Indications of Alarm Status. Indications of alarm status shall be revealed at the\nmonitoring station and optionally within the confines of the secure area.\n\n(7) Power Supplies. Primary power forall IDE shall be commercial altemating or direct\ncurrent (AC or DC) power. In the event of commercial power failure at the protected area or\nmonitor station, the equipment shall change power sources without causing an alarm indication.\n\n(a) Emergency Power. Emergency power shall consist of a protected independent\nbackup power source that provides a minimum of 8 hours operating power battery and/or\ngenerator power. When batteries are used for emergency power, they shall be maintained at full\ncharge by automatic charging circuits. The manufacturer's periodic maintenance schedule shall\nbe followed and results documented.\n\n(b) Power Source and Failure Indication. An illuminated indication shall exist at the\nPCU of the power source in use (AC or DC). Equipment at the monitor station shall indicate a\nfailure in power source, a change in power source, and the location of the failure or change.\n\n(8) Component Tamper Protection. IDE components located inside or outside the secure\narea shall be evaluated for a tamper protection requirement. If access to ajunction box or\ncontroller will enable an unauthorized modification, tamper protection shall be provided.\n\ne. System Requirements\n\n(1) Independent Equipment. When many alarmed areas are protected by one monitor\nstation, secure room zones shall be clearly distinguishable from the other zones to facilitate a\npriority response. All sensors shall be installed within the protected area.\n\n(2) Access and/or Secure Switch and PCU. No capability shall exist to allow changing\nthe access status of the IDS froma location outside the protected area. All PCUs shall be located\ninside the secure area and should be located near the entrance. Assigned personnel shall initiate\nall changes in access and secure status. Operations of the PCU may be restricted by use of a\n\n \n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 48 APPENDIX TO ENCLOSURE 3",

In the secure mode, any unauthorized entry into\nthe space shall cause an alarm to be transmitted to the monitor station.\n\n(3) Motion Detection Protection. Secure areas that reasonably afford access to the\nsecunity container or area where classified data is stored shall be protected with motion detection\nsensors; e.g., ultrasonic and passive infrared. Use of dual technology is authorized when one\ntechnology transmits an alarm condition independently from the other technology. A failed\ndetector shall cause an immediate and continuous alarm condition.\n\n(4) Protection of Perimeter Doors. When an IDS is installed, each perimeter door shall\nbe protected by a balanced magnetic switch that meets UL Standard 634 (Reference (au)).\n\n(5) Windows. All readily accessible windows (within 18 feet of ground level) shall be\nprotected by an IDS, either independently or by the motion detection sensors within the space,\nwhenever a secure room is located within a controlled compound or equivalent and forced entry\nprotection of the windows is not provided (also see subparagraph 1.b.(4) of this Appendix).\n\n \n\n(6) IDS Requirements for Continuous Operations Facilities. A continuous operation\nfacility may not require an IDS. This type of secure area should be equipped with an alerting\nsystem if the occupants cannot observe all potential entrances into the room. Duress devices\nmay also be required.\n\n(7) False and/or Nuisance Alarm. Any alarm signal transmitted in the absence of\ndetected intrusion that is not identified as a nuisance alarm is a false alam. A nuisance alarm is\nthe activation of an alarm sensor by some influence for which the sensor was designed but which\nis not related to an intrusion attempt. All alarms shall be investigated and the results\ndocumented. The maintenance program for the IDS shall ensure that incidents of false and/or\nnuisance alarms shall not exceed 1 in a period of 30 days per zone.\n\nf. Installation, Maintenance and Monitoring\n\n \n\n(1) IDS Installation and Maintenance Personnel. Alarm installation and maintenance\nshall be accomplished by U.S. citizens who have been subjected to a trustworthiness\ndetermination according to Reference (1).\n\n \n\n(2) Monitor Station Staffing. The monitor station shall be supervised continuously by\nU.S. citizens who have been subjected to a trustworthiness determination according to\nReference (1).\n\n3. ACCESS CONTROLS\na. The perimeter entrance to a secure facility (i.e., vault or secure room) shall be under\ncontrol at all times during working hours to prevent entry by unauthorized personnel. This may\n\nbe achieved by visual control or through use of an automated entry control system (AECS) that\ncomplies with the requirements of subparagraph 3.a.(2) of this section. Uncleared persons are to\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 49 APPENDIX TO ENCLOSURE 3",

Personnel entering or leaving an area shall be required to secure the entrance or exit\npoint. Authorized personnel who pennit another individual to enter the area are responsible for\nconfirming their need to know and access.\n\n(1) Visual control may be accomplished by methods such as designated employees,\nguards, or continuously monitored closed circuit television.\n\n(2) AnAECS may be used if it meets the criteria stated in subparagraphs 3.a.(2)(a) and\n3.a.(2)(b). The AECS shall identify an individual and authenticate the person’ s authority to enter\nthe area through the use of an identification (ID) badge or card.\n\n(a) The ID badge or key card shall use embedded sensors, integrated circuits,\nmagnetic stripes, or other means of encoding data that identifies the facility and the individual to\nwhom the card is issued.\n\n(b) Biometrics verification identifies the individual requesting access by some unique\npersonal characteristic and may be required for access to sensitive information. The Biometrics\nIdentity Management Agency can provide further information regarding biometric technologies\nand capabilities. Personal characteristics that can be used for identity verification include:\n\nIe\n\n. Hand geometry.\n. Handwriting.\n\n1)\n\nIvo\n\n. Iris scans.\n\n. Voice.\n\nlon\n\nIn\n\n. Facial recognition.\n\n(3) In conjunction with subparagraph 3.a.(2)(a) of this section, a personal identification\nnumber (PIN) may be required. The PIN shall be separately entered into the system by each\nindividual using a keypad device and shall consist of four or more digits, randomly selected, with\nno known or logical association with the individual. The PIN shall be changed when it is\nbelieved to have been compromised or subjected to compromise.\n\n(4) Authentication of the individual’ s authorization to enter the area shall be\naccomplished within the system by inputs from the ID badge and/or card, the personal identity\nverification device, or the keypad with an electronic database of individuals authorized to enter\nthe area. A procedure shall be established for removing the individual’ s authorization to enter\nthe area upon reassignment, transfer, or termination, or when the individual’s access is\nsuspended, revoked, or downgraded to a level lower than the required access level.\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 50 APPENDIX TO ENCLOSURE 3",

Protection of classified information is essential to maintaining security\nand achieving mission success in DoD operational and warfighting environments. Prompt\nreporting of security incidents ensure that such incidents are properly investigated and the\nnecessary actions are taken to negate or minimize the adverse effects of an actual loss or\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information and to preclude recurrence through an\ninformed, properly tailored, and up-to-date security education and awareness program. In cases\nwhere compromise has been ruled out and there is no adverse effect on national security, a\ncommon sense approach to the early resolution of an incident at the lowest appropriate level is\nencouraged. All security incidents involving classified information shall involve a security\ninquiry, a secunty investigation, or both.\n\na. The terms associated with security incidents are formally defined in the Glossary, but to\nensure common understanding, the following general characterizations are provided:\n\n(1) Infraction. An infraction is a secunity incident involving failure to comply with\nrequirements (i.e., the provisions of References (d) and (f), this Manual or other applicable\nsecurity policy) which cannot reasonably be expected to, and does not, result in the loss,\nsuspected compromise, or compromise of classified information. An infraction may be\nunintentional or inadvertent. While it does not constitute a secunty violation, if left uncorrected,\ncan lead to security violations or compromises. It requires an inquiry to facilitate immediate\ncorrective action but does not require an in-depth investigation.\n\n(2) Violation. Violations are security incidents that indicate knowing, willful, and\nnegligent for security regulations, and result in, or could be expected to result in, the loss or\ncompromise of classified information. Security violations require an inquiry and/or\ninvestigation.\n\n \n\n(a) Compromise. A compromise is a security incident (more specifically, a\nviolation) in which there is an unauthorized disclosure of classified information (i.e., disclosure\nto a person(s) who does not have a valid clearance, authorized access, or a need to know).\n\n(b) Loss. A loss occurs when classified information cannot be physically located or\naccounted for (e.g., classified information/equipment is discovered missing during an audit and\ncannot be immediately located).\n\n \n\n(3) Inquiry. An inquiry is fact-finding and analysis conducted to detenmine whether or\nnot there was a loss of classified information or whether or not unauthorized personnel had, or\ncould have had, access to the information. The inquiry identifies the facts, characterizes the\nincident as an infraction or a violation, identifies if possible the cause(s) and person(s)\nresponsible, reports corrective actions taken or to be taken, and makes recommendations as to the\nneed for further corrective action or a more in-depth investigation. Inquires, generally, are\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 86 ENCLOSURE 6",
    "Page_87": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\ninitiated and conducted at the lowest echelon possible within the DoD Component.\n\n(4) Investigation. An investigation is conducted for a security violation when the\nincident cannot be resolved via inquiry or for incidents where an in-depth and comprehensive\nexamination of the matter is appropriate.\n\nb. Certain practices dangerous to security, while not reportable as security incidents, have\nthe potential to jeopardize the security of classified information and material if allowed to\nperpetuate. Examples of such practices are: placing a paper recycling box next to a classified\ncopier or placing bum bags next to unclassified trash containers; stopping at a public\nestablishment to conduct personal business while hand-carrying classified information; or failing\nto change security container combinations promptly when required. These practices, when\nidentified, must be promptly addressed by security management and appropriate changes made,\nactions taken, or training provided, to ensure the security of classified information.\n\n2. CONSEQUENCES OF COMPROMISE. The compromise of classified information presents\na threat to the national security and may damage intelligence or operational capabilities; lessen\nthe DoD ability to protect critical information, technologies, and programs; or reduce the\neffectiveness of DoD management. Once a compromise is known to have occurred, the\nseriousness of damage to U.S. national security or the extent of the adverse affect on the national\nsecunity must be detenmined and appropriate measures taken to negate or minimize the adverse\neffects. When possible, action shall also be taken to regain custody of documents or material\nthat was compromised. In all cases, security management must take appropriate action to\nidentify the source and reason for the suspected or actual compromise and take remedial action\nto prevent recurrence.\n\n \n\n3. REPORTING AND NOTIFICATIONS\n\n \n\na Anyone finding classified information out of proper control shall, if possible, take custody\nof and safeguard the material and immediately notify the appropriate security authorities. Secure\ncommunications should be used for notification whenever possible.\n\nb. Every civilian employee and Active, Reserve, and National Guard Military member of the\nDepartment of Defense, and every DoD contractor or employee of a contractor working with\nClassified material, as provided by the terms of the contract, who becomes aware of the loss or\npotential compromise of classified information shall immediately report it to the head of his or\nher local activity and to the activity security manager.\n\nc. If the person believes that the head of the activity or the security manager may have been\ninvolved in or responsible for the incident, he or she may report it to the security authorities at\nthe next higher level of command or supervision. If circumstances of discovery make such\nnotification impractical, the individual shall notify the commanding officer or security manager\nat the most readily available DoD facility or contact any DoD law enforcement,\ncounterintelligence (CI), or Defense criminal investigative organization (DCIO).\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 87 ENCLOSURE 6",

Activity security officials shall advise their chain of command of compromises occuning\nwithin their area of security responsibility or involving assigned personnel.\n\ne. If the head of an activity or the activity security manager to whom an incident is initially\nreported does not have security cognizance over the incident, such official shall ensure that the\nincident is reported to the appropriate authority. The organization with security cognizance shall\nensure that an inquiry and, when appropriate, investigation are conducted, as needed, consistent\nwith the requirements of this enclosure and corrective action is taken as required.\n\nf. Reporting confirmed security incidents to the Director of Security, OUSD(I&S), is\nnecessary when the incidents have or may have significant consequences or the fact of the\nincident may become public.

Security incident reports shall be classified according to the content of the report and at\nthe level prescribed by the applicable program security classification guides. At a minimum,\nreports shall be designated FOUO and marked as required by Volume 4 of this Manual, in order\nto provide appropriate protection for information regarding personnel involved and information\nthat could facilitate unauthorized access to classified information. If the lost or compromised\ninformation is beyond the jurisdiction of the U.S. Govemment and cannot be recovered (e.g.,\nmedia leak, public website posting, or loss in a foreign country), the report and location of the\ncompromise (e.g., geographic location of unrecoverable equipment) shall be classified\ncommensurate with the classification level of the compromised material to prevent further\nunauthorized disclosure.\n\nb. Ifan FOUO report is to be disseminated outside the Department of Defense (e.g., to\nanother Federal agency), the face of the document shall bear an expanded marking, as specified\nin Enclosure 3 of Volume 4 of this Manual, stating that the information may be exempt from\nmandatory disclosure pursuant to section 552 of title 5, U.S.C.

Security officials shall not initiate or continue an inquiry\nor investigation of the incident unless it is fully coordinated with the cognizant Defense CI\ncomponent.\n\nb. Secunity Incidents Involving Apparent Violations of Criminal Law. Any incident in\nwhich an apparent violation of criminal law is suspected, but which is reasonably not believed to\nbe espionage or involving matters described in paragraph 5.a of this section, shall be reported\nimmediately to the local DCIO. If that organization accepts jurisdiction and initiates action,\ncoordinate with them prior to taking any further action on the security inquiry or investigation so\nas not to jeopardize the integrity of either investigation.\n\nc. Security Incidents Involving COMSEC or Cryptologic Information. Actual or potential\ncompromises involving cryptographic information shall be handled according to NSTISSI 4003\n(Reference (bn)).\n\nd. Security Incidents Involving SCI. Actual or potential compromises involving SCI shall be\nreported to the activity SSO and handled in accordance with References (i) and (hj).\n\n(1) Incidents involving SCI that meet the criteria in paragraph 3.f of this enclosure shall\nalso be reported to the Director of Security, OUSD(I&S).\n\n(2) If aDoD Component believes a disclosure may contain classified SCI information\nunder the control of an(other) Intelligence Community agency, the DoD Component shall notify\nNCIX. NCIX shall coordinate notification to the affected agency.\n\ne. Security Incidents Involving RD and/or FRD. In accordance with the provisions of\nsection 3161 of Public Law 105-261 (Reference (bo)), and its implementing plan, the Secretary\nof Energy must report to Congress inadvertent disclosure of RD or FRD occuming pursuant to\nautomatic declassification processes. Components shall notify the Department of Energy as\nnecessary and provide a copy of the notification to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nNuclear Matters and the Director of Security, OUSD(I&S).\n\n \n\nf. Security Incidents Involving IT. Actual or potential compromises of classified\ninformation involving IT, automated information systems, or computer systems, terminals, or\nequipment shall be reported, in accordance with Reference (v), through appropriate channels by\nthe IA manager (IAM) to the activity security manager. Inquiries into and resolution of incidents\ninvolving compromise of classified information resident on computers or in IT systems require\ncoordination with and assistance from the local IA officials, but prompt resolution remains the\nresponsibility of the activity security manager. See Enclosure 7 for additional guidance on\nhandling of classified data spills.\n\ng. Security Incidents Involving FGI or NATO Information.

Actual or potential compromises involving DoD\nSAPs, or results of inquiries and/or investigations that indicate that weaknesses or vulnerabilities\nin established SAP policy and/or procedures contributed to an actual or potential compromise,\nshall be reported by the DoD Component SAP program office to the DoD SAP Central Office,\nwhich shall report to the Director of Security, OUSD(I&S).\n\nj. Secunty Incidents Involving Improper Transfer of Classified Information Any activity\nthat receives classified information that has been improperly handled, addressed, packaged,\ntransmitted, or transported shall make a determination as to whether the information has been\nsubjected to compromise. If the activity determines that the classified information has been\nsubjected to compromise, the receiving activity shall immediately notify the sending activity,\nwhich shall be responsible for initiating an inquiry or investigation, as appropriate. The\nreceiving activity shall share information generated regarding the incident with the sending\nactivity. The sending activity is responsible for required notifications (e.g., to the OCA).\nClassified information shall be considered as having been subjected to compromise if it has been\nhandled through foreign postal systems, its shipping container has been damaged to an extent\nthat the contents are exposed, or it has been transmitted (e.g., telephone, facsimile, message, e-\nmail, computer or data links) over commumications circuits that are not approved for\ntransmission of classified information. If the receiving activity determines that classified\ninformation was not in fact compromised, but was nevertheless improperly prepared or\ntransferred, the receiving activity shall report the discrepancy to the sending activity.\n\n \n\nk. Secunity Incidents Involving On-Site Contractors. Security incidents, including any\ninquines or investigations required, involving on-site contractors shall be handled in accordance\nwith paragraph C1.1.9 of Reference (az). As specified by paragraph C1.1.9 of Reference (az)\nand paragraph 6-105c of Reference (w), host activity security rules and procedures apply.\nDisciplinary action and sanctions are the responsibility of the contractor's company unless\nspecific contract provisions address such actions. Security managers shall fumish the results of\ninquines to the company, with a copy to Defense Security Service, in order to facilitate such\naction. Specified U.S. Govemment officials retain the ability, when appropriate and in\naccordance with the authorities and requirements of Reference (az), to deny access to classified\ninformation, to revoke or suspend security clearances, and to take certain other administrative\nactions, such as to deny an individual continued access to the facility.\n\n \n\n1. Security Incidents Involving Critical Program Information (CPI). Upon leaming that\nClassified CPI or CPI related to classified contracts may have been or was actually compromised,\n\n \n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 91 ENCLOSURE 6",

The specific CPI involved in the\nincident should be identified in inquiry and investigation reports. Classify reports as required by\nthe applicable program security classification guide(s).\n\nm. Security Incidents Involving ACCM-Protected Information. Security officials shall refer\nto section 18 of Enclosure 2 of this Volume for additional guidance on security incidents\ninvolving ACCM-protected information as well as safeguarding and handling of ACCM-\nprotected information.\n\nn. Absence Without Authorization. When an individual who has had access to classified\ninformation is absent without authorization, the head of the activity or security manager shall\ndetermine if there are indications of activities, behavior, or associations that could indicate\nClassified information may be at risk. If so, the supporting Defense CI component shall be\nnotified in accordance with Reference (bp). The scope and depth of the inquiry shall depend on\nthe length of absence and the sensitivity of the classified information involved. Missing\npersonnel authorized SCI access shall be reported in accordance with Reference (i).\n\no. Coordination with Legal Counsel and the Department of Justice (DoJ). Whenever formal\naction, beyond adjudication of a finding of a security violation and assignment of reprimand or\ndisciplinary action at the activity level is contemplated against any person believed responsible\nfor the unauthorized disclosure of classified information, DoD Component officials shall\ncoordinate with servicing legal counsel. Whenever a criminal violation appears to have occurred\nand a criminal prosecution is contemplated, Component officials shall use established procedures\nand channels to ensure coordination with the legal counsel of the DoD Component or Federal\nagency where the individual is assigned or employed and the DoJ.\n\n6. SECURITY INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS\n\n \n\na Requirement. All known or suspected instances of unauthorized disclosure of classified\ninformation shall be promptly addressed by the cognizant DoD Component to decide the nature\nand circumstances of the disclosure and the extent of damage to national security, and\nappropriate corrective action shall be taken. See Appendix 1 to this enclosure for a sample,\noptional format for use in documenting actions. Reports of inquiries and investigations, at a\nminimum, shall be designated and marked as FOUO.\n\nb. Coordination with Criminal Investigative Organization or Defense CI Component. When\ninformation suggestive of a criminal or CI nature is discovered, all actions associated with the\ninquiry or investigation shall cease pending coordination with the cognizant DCIO or Defense CI\ncomponent. If the DCIO or Defense CI component accepts jurisdiction, the inquiry or\ninvestigation shall not be resumed without agreement of the cognizant criminal investigative\norganization or CI component. All relevant information shall be released with an annotation in\nthe report that the matter was referred to the specific DCIO or Defense CI component.

Annotate the report appropriately and include the identity of the\nofficial who made the declination decision and his or her organization.\n\nc. Coordination with OCA\n\n(1) If the inquiry or investigation determines that a compromise occurred, the official\ninitiating the inquiry or investigation shall immediately notify the originator (i.e., the OCA) of\nthe information or material involved. The OCA(s) shall take the actions required by section 9 of\nthis enclosure.\n\n(2) If the originating activity no longer exists, the activity that inherited the functions of\nthe originating activity shall be notified. If the functions of the originating activity were\ndispersed to more than one other activity, the inheriting activity(ies) cannot be detenmined, or the\nfunctions have ceased to exist, the senior agency official of the DoD Component of which the\noriginating activity was a part shall be notified. This notification shall not be delayed pending\ncompletion of any additional inquiry or investigation or resolution of other related issues.\n\nd. Security Inquiries. The head of the activity or activity security manager having security\ncognizance shall initiate an inquiry into the actual or potential compromise promptly to\ndetermine the facts and circumstances of the incident, and to characterize the incident as an\ninfraction ora violation. At conclusion of the inquiry, a narrative of findings is provided in\nsupport of recommended additional investigative or other actions by the activity.\n\n(1) The official appointed to lead the inquiry shall not be anyone involved with the\nincident.

The decision on whether to initiate an additional investigation by a DCIO or by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation through a referral to the DoJ shall be based on the following\nfactors:\n\n(1) The accuracy of the information disclosed.\n\n(2) The damage to national security caused by the disclosure and whether there were\ncompromises regarding sensitive aspects of current classified projects, intelligence sources, or\nintelligence methods.\n\n(3) The extent to which the disclosed information was circulated, both within and outside\nthe Department of Defense, and the number of persons known to have access to it.\n\n(4) The degree to which an investigation shall increase the damage caused by the\ndisclosure.\n\n(5) The existence of any investigative leads.\n\n(6) The reasonable expectation of repeated disclosures.\n\ng. If the DoD Components initial inquiry or investigation or a DCIO investigation identifies\nthe person(s) responsible for an unauthorized disclosure of classified information via the public\nmedia or Intemet, the DoD Component shall notify the Director of Security, OUSD(I&S). This\nnotification shall include responses to the DoJ Media Leak Questionnaire (see Appendix 2 of this\nenclosure). The USD(I&S), in coordination with the General Counsel of the Department of\nDefense (GC, DoD) and the Head of the DoD Component having OCA, shall decide whether\nadditional investigation is appropriate and whether to refer the unauthorized disclosure to the\nDoJ forinvestigation and/or criminal prosecution. When the initial inquiry or investigation does\nnot identify the person responsible, the Head of the DoD Component, in consultation with the\nUSD(I&S) and the GC, DoD, shall decide if further investigation is appropriate.\n\n8.

Ifthe conclusion of the inquiry or investigation is that a compromise occurred and that\nweakness or vulnerability in established secunity practices and/or procedures contributed to the\ncompromise or that the potential exists for a compromise of classified information due to a\nweakness or vulnerability in established security practices and/or procedures, the appropriate\nresponsible security official shall take prompt action to issue new or revised guidance, as\nnecessary, to resolve identified deficiencies. Results of inquines and/or investigations into actual\nor potential compromises that indicate that defects in the procedures and requirements of this\nManual contributed to the incident shall be reported to the Director of Security, OUSD(I&S).\n\nb. If the conclusion of the inquiry or investigation is that a compromise did not occur, but\nthat there was potential for compromise of classified information due to a failure of a person or\npersons to comply with established security practices and/or procedures, the official having\nsecurity responsibility over such persons shall be responsible for taking action as may be\nappropriate to resolve the incident.\n\nc. Additional investigation, beyond what is required by this enclosure, may be needed to\npennit application of appropriate sanctions for violation of regulations, criminal prosecution, or\ndetermination of effective remedies for discovered vulnerabilities. The inquiry this enclosure\nrequires may serve as part of these investigations, but notifying OCAs shall not be delayed\npending completion of these additional investigations.\n\n9, ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY THE OCA. When notified of the compromise of classified\ninformation, the OCA shall:\n\n \n\na. Verify the classification and duration of classification initially assigned to the information.\n\nb. Reevaluate the classification assigned to determine whether the classification shall be\ncontinued or changed. This classification review shall consider the following possibilities:\n\n(1) The information has lost all or some of its sensitivity since it was initially classified\nand should be downgraded or declassified. (In rare cases, it might also be discovered that the\ninformation has gained sensitivity and should be upgraded.)\n\n(2) The information has been so compromised by the incident that attempting to protect\nit further as classified is unrealistic or inadvisable, and it should be declassified.\n\n(3) The information should continue to be classified at its current level.\n\nc. Advise the activity reporting the compromise of the outcome of the classification\nassessment required by paragraphs 9.a and 9.b of this section within 72 hours of notification.\n\nd. Assess the impact of the compromise on the affected system, plan, program, or project;\n\nconsider countermeasures (e.g., damage control actions) that may be taken to minimize, mitigate\nor limit damage to national security and prevent further loss or compromise; and then initiate or\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 97 ENCLOSURE 6",
    "Page_98": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\nrecommend adoption of such countermeasures.\n\n(1) Where appropriate, countermeasures should be applied as quickly as possible and\nmay be initiated prior to completion of the classification review or damage assessment.\n\n(2) Countermeasures could include changing plans or system design features, revising\noperating procedures, providing increased protection to related information (e.g., classification\nupgrading), or other appropriate actions.\n\n(3) Evaluate the cost implications of information, operational, or technology losses;\ndevelopmental and integration costs of countenmeasures; likelihood of countermeasure success;\nand programmatic impacts of the unmitigated loss and/or compromise of specific classified\ninformation.\n\ne. Conduct a damage assessment as required by section 10 of this enclosure to determine the\neffect of the compromise of classified information on the national security.\n\n10. DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS\n\na. A damage assessment is undertaken to detenmine the effect of a compromise on the\nnational secunity.\n\n(1) A damage assessment shall normally consist of a detailed, multidisciplinary\nexamination of the facts surrounding the commpromise to determine the practical effects of a\ncompromise on DoD programs, operations, systems, materials, and intelligence and on the\nDepartment of Defense’ s ability to conduct its missions; to address mitigations and\ncountermeasures that could be put in place to decrease or offset the impact; to detenmine the\nestimated dollar costs to implement countermeasures essential to maintain or reinstate security,\nor to replace weapons systems or capabilities that are thoroughly compromised; and to provide,\nwhen appropriate, specific recommendations for action.\n\n(2) A damage assessment is conducted after the classification review and often follows\nany prosecutorial actions. However, when necessary to identify damage done by the disclosure\nor otherwise appropriate, a damage assessment may be conducted pre-prosecution.\n\n(3) The damage assessment is not to be confused either with the classification review\nperformed by the OCA or with damage control actions, which are those actions performed\nimmediately upon the discovery of disclosure or compromise to minimize risk, limit damage,\nand/or prevent further loss or compromise.\n\nb. Each DoD Component shall establish a system of controls and intemal procedures to\nensure that damage assessments are conducted, at a minimum, for cases of compromise\ninvolving espionage, intelligence information or compromise via the public media. Damage\nassessments are encouraged for other compromises.\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 98 ENCLOSURE 6",
    "Page_99": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\n(1) Conduct of the damage assessment is the responsibility of the OCA and subject\nmatter experts. Security officials should provide assistance as needed and appropriate.\n\n(2) The results of relevant security inquiries and investigations shall be made available to\ninform the damage assessment process, as needed. Reports of criminal or Cl investigations\nassociated with the compromise should be requested by the OCA from the cognizant DCIO or\nDefense CI component.\n\n11. VERIFICATION, REEVALUATION, AND DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TIMELINES. The\nverification and reevaluation steps in section 9 of this enclosure, and when appropriate the\ndamage assessment process in section 10 of this enclosure, shall be completed as soon as\npossible following notification of a compromise. However, damage assessments requiring multi-\ndisciplinary or multiple agency review of the adverse effects of the compromise on systems,\noperations, and/or intelligence, may sometimes be a long-term process. The DoD goal for\ncompletion of a damage assessment involving compromised classified information is no longer\nthan 6 months from the first date the compromise was declared. Accomplishment of the\nassessment prior to the initiation of legal or administrative proceedings may be beneficial; check\nwith legal counsel.\n\n12. ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL COMPROMISES INVOLVING MORE THAN ONE\nAGENCY. When classified information under the control of more than one DoD Component or\nanother Federal agency is involved, the affected activities are responsible for coordinating their\nefforts in evaluating the classification of information involved and assessing damage.\n\n13. DEBRIEFING IN CASES OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. In cases where unauthorized\naccess to classified information has occurred, it may be advisable to discuss the situation with the\nindividual(s) to enhance the probability that he or she shall properly protect it. The activity head\nshall determine if a debriefing is warranted. This decision shall be based on the circumstances of\nthe incident, what is known about the person(s) involved, and the nature of the information. The\nfollowing general guidelines apply:\n\na. If the unauthorized access was by a person with the appropriate security clearance but no\nneed to know, debriefing is usually appropriate only so far as necessary to ensure that the\nindividual is aware that the information to which they had unauthorized access is classified and\nrequires protection.\n\n \n\nb. If the unauthorized access was by U.S. Govemment civilian or military personnel or an\nemployee of a U.S. Govemment contractor, who does not have a security clearance, debriefing is\nusually appropriate. The person shall be advised of his or her responsibility to prevent further\ndissemination of the information and of the administrative sanctions and criminal penalties that\nmight follow if he or she fails to do so. The debriefing shall be designed to ensure that the\nindividual understands the nature of the information, why its protection is important, and knows\nwhat to do if someone ties to obtain the information. In the case of non-DoD U.S. Govemment\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 99 ENCLOSURE 6",
    "Page_100": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\npersonnel and employees of U.S. Govemment contractors, the appropriate security official in the\nindividual’ s parent organization, including the appropriate facility security officer where\napplicable, shall be advised of the debriefing.\n\nc. If the person involved is neither a member of a U.S. Govemment organization nor an\nemployee of a U.S. Goverment contractor, the decision is much more situational. The key\nquestion is whether the debriefing shall have a positive effect on the person’ s ability or\nwillingness to protect the information.\n\nd. Inany case where the person to be debriefed may be the subject of criminal prosecution or\ndisciplinary action, consult with legal counsel before attempting to debrief the individual.\n\ne. Itis sometimes useful to have the person being debriefed sign a statement acknowledging\nthe debriefing and his or her understanding of its contents, or to execute a SF 312. If an NDA is\nnot executed, the nature and format of the statement is left to the discretion of the local security\nofficial to allow flexibility in meeting the requirements of a particular incident. If the person\nrefuses to sign an NDA or debriefing statement when asked, this fact and his or her stated\nreasons for refusing shall be made a matter of record in the inquiry.\n\n14, REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS. The DoD Components shall establish\nnecessary reporting and oversight mechanisms to ensure that inquiries and/or investigations are\nconducted when required, that they are done in a timely and efficient manner, and that\nappropriate management action is taken to correct identified problems. Inquiries or\ninvestigations and management analyses of security incidents shall consider possible systemic\nshortcomings that may have caused or contributed to the incident. The effectiveness of activity\nsecurity procedures, security education, supervisory oversight of security practices, etc., shall be\nconsidered in determining causes and contributing factors. The focus of management response\nto security incidents shall be to eliminate or minimize the probability of further incidents\noccuning. Appropriate disciplinary action or legal prosecution, as discussed in section 17,\nEnclosure 3 of Volume 1 of this Manual, is sometimes one means of doing this, but the broader\nfocus on prevention shall not be lost. Simple disciplinary action, without consideration of what\nother factors may have contributed to the situation, shall not be considered an acceptable\nresponse to a security incident.\nAppendixes\n\n1.

This enclosure identifies and discusses the most common IT issues facing\nsecurity organizations and provides references and pointers to the relevant primary sources. As\nthe Intemet, classified and unclassified networks, and a wide range of computer systems are used\nin every facet of the operation of the Department of Defense, challenges and questions related to\nIT issues and the interaction between the security and IT staffs abound. The traditional security\nmanager's portfolio, planning horizon, and focus on classification management and personal,\nphysical, and operational security issues no longer suffice. The continuing protection and\nsecunity of complex IT and information systems depends upon a robust and effective interaction\nand coordination between security and IT organizations.\n\n2. RESPONSIBILITY. In accordance with Reference (b), overall security responsibility for\nprotection of classified information and CUI remains with the information security program and\nstaff, even though the data and/or information resides on IT and information systems and\nnetworks managed and controlled by the DoD Component Chief Information Officer.\nAccordingly, proactive and continuous engagement and collaboration between security, IT, and\nIA professionals, at all organizational levels, is essential in order to ensure the protection of DoD\ninformation as well as the Department’ s electronic enterprise.\n\n3. IA ROLES AND FUNCTIONS\n\na. In accordance with Reference (v) and DoDD 8000.01 (Reference (bq)), IA and IT policy\nand information systems operations are the purview of the Chief Information Officer of the\nDepartment of Defense at the OSD level and the counterpart organizations in the DoD\nComponents.\n\nb. U.S. Strategic Command, through U.S. Cyber Command (USCY BERCOM), has the\noverall responsibility for directing the operation of and assuring the secunity of the global DoD\nnetwork environment. USCYBERCOM will lead the day-to-day defense and protection of the\nDoD networks and will coordinate all DoD network operations, providing full spectrum support\nto military and countertenorism missions.\n\nc. At the DoD Component and activity level, there are several important IA roles and\nfunctions that security managers need to recognize and understand to develop a productive\nrelationship with the IA staff, including the designated approving authority (DAA), IAM, and IA\nofficer (IAO). The Glossary provides definitions of these functions and identifies other titles that\nare sometimes used for these same functions.\n\n4, IA CONCEPTS\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 104 ENCLOSURE 7",
    "Page_105": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\na IA Attributes. All DoD information systems are to maintain appropmiate levels of\navailability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation in order to protect and\ndefend DoD information and networks. While all five of these attributes are critical to the user's\nability to perform the assigned mission, from an information security perspective, confidentiality\nand authentication may be the most important.\n\n(1) The loss of availability means that the information system, computer network, and/or\ndata are unavailable to authorized users, and missions or operations cannot be performed. Loss\nof availability within a computing environment may be an extremely serious event, depending on\nthe criticality of the applications and missions supported.\n\n(2) The loss of integrity means that the data can no longer be trusted to be reliable or\naccurate.\n\n(3) Authentication is critical, as it is the mechanism that authorizes or allows access to\ncomputer systems and networks and the data that resides there. Loss of or incorrect\nauthentication services could allow unauthorized access to classified data.\n\n(4) The loss of confidentiality means that data may be available in an electronic form to\nusers who are not authorized to receive it. Depending on the classification level of the system or\nnetwork, loss of confidentiality could mean a compromise of classified information.\n\n(5) The loss of non-repudiation assurances means that authorized users no longer can be\ncertain with whom they are communicating because general communications (and therefore the\ndata processed by that information system) cannot be trusted or verified.\n\nb. System Categorization. Each information system must be categorized and have\nappropriate IA controls assigned in accordance with Reference (v). System categorization\nrequires determination of the potential impacts of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability associated with the specific system or information. JA controls are selected based on\nthe results of the system categorization process. Security personnel may find it helpful to\nunderstand the categorization of the DoD information system(s) within their area of\nresponsibility, as those designations impact the information, physical, personal, and operational\nsecunity environment and the resource requirements that must be dedicated to protection of the\nsystem(s) and the information processed.\n\nc. Certification and Accreditation (C&A). C&A of DoD systems is govemed by\nReference (s).\n\n \n\n(1) Certification is the comprehensive evaluation of the technical and nontechnical (e.g.,\nprocedural) security safeguards of an information system undertaken to support the accreditation\nprocess. It establishes the extent to which a particular design and implementation meets a set of\nspecified security requirements.\n\n(2) Accreditation is the formal declaration by a DAA that, based on the implementation\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 105 ENCLOSURE 7",
    "Page_106": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\nof a specified set of technical, managerial, and procedural safeguards, the level of risk is\nacceptable and the information system is approved to operate at a specific security level.\n\n(3) The security manager and the DAA should coordinate with each other during the\nC&A process. The DAA needs to work with the security organization to ensure an\nunderstanding of the security requirements that must be met based on the classification of the\ninformation to be processed, and for identification of any security issues associated with the\noperation of the system. The security staff, on the other hand, must be aware of the nature,\nscope, and schedule of ongoing C&A activities within a given organization, in order to provide\ntimely and relevant classification management direction and to ensure the physical environment\nis properly secured and accredited for the operations planned and that users are properly cleared\nand have all requisite access in time to support the mission.\n\n5. DATA SPILLS\n\na. Classified data spills occur when classified data is introduced either onto an unclassified\ninformation system or to an information system with a lower level of classification, or to a\nsystem not accredited to process data of that restrictive category. Although it is possible that no\nunauthorized disclosure occurred, classified data spills are considered and handled as a possible\ncompromise of classified information involving information systems, networks, and computer\nequipment until the inquiry determines whether an unauthorized disclosure did or did not occur.\n\nb. When a classified data spill occurs, the activity security manager is responsible ensuring\nthat the policy requirements for addressing an unauthorized disclosure, as specified in Enclosure\n6 or other provisions of this Manual, are met (e.g., inquiry, notification, investigation, damage\nassessment); however, these responsibilities must be carried out in close coordination with the IT\nand/or IA staff, which has overall responsibility for the operation of the networks and systems as\nwell as the technical knowledge needed to address the spill. Security personnel have the overall\nlead for addressing such events.\n\nc. CNSS Policy 18 (Reference (br)) applies to the spillage of classified national security\ninformation on any information system, be it govemment, contractor, or privately owned, and\nprovides a policy framework for the consistent handling of the spillage. Each Federal\nGovemment organization that owns or operates classified information systems is required to\nestablish policies and procedures for handling classified information spillage. When a classified\ndata spill occurs, Reference (br) requires that it is immediately:\n\n(1) Reported to the appropriate authorities, including, at a minimum, the OCA, the\ninformation owner/originator, the IAM, the activity security manager, and the responsible\ncomputer incident response center.\n\n(2) Isolated and contained to minimize damage and to preserve evidence that may be\nrequired for damage assessment, risk assessment, law enforcement, or CI purposes. All affected\nmedia is to be considered classified at the same level as the spilled information until the\nappropriate remediation processes have been executed and verified.\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 106 ENCLOSURE 7",
    "Page_107": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\n(3) Verified to be classified by the information owner, who shall also ensure an\nassessment is conducted, as appropriate, in accordance with References (d) and (f) and this\nManual.\n\nd. CNSS Instruction 1001 (Reference (bs)) inyplements Reference (br) and provides a list of\nquestions that should be asked when investigating a spill, potential options for remediating the\neffects of a spill, and factors to be considered in selecting a remediation procedure.\n\ne. Information conceming a classified spillage incident shall be protected from disclosure.\nCommumications regarding the fact that a spill situation exists should be communicated to those\ninvolved, including the remediation teams, via secure communications whenever possible. The\ntechnical remediation teams must be cleared to the level of the information that may have been\nspilled.\n\nf. Decisions regarding mitigation procedures, including disposition of affected media (i.e.,\nsanitization, physical removal, or destruction) shall realistically consider the potential harm that\nmay result from compromise of spilled information.\n\ng. During a spill event, a speedy and coordinated response among secunty, IA, and other\ntechnical personnel is vital. Significant unauthorized or inadvertent dissemination of classified\ninformation on unclassified information systems can occur rapidly.\n\n(1) Once a spill is reported, the information system support organization must, whenever\npossible, quickly implement technical isolation of contaminated workstations, servers, and back-\nup systems to avoid spreading the contamination, to avoid loss of systems availability, and to\nminimize exposure of classified information to those individuals or organizations not authorized\nto receive it. At the same time, the security and IT staffs must begin the process of determining\nwhether a security incident has actually occurred. If so, remediation procedures, which must be\ndeveloped, approved, and tested in advance, should be implemented.\n\n(2) E-mail (whether in the body of the e-mail or attachment) is the most common method\nby which spills occur. The JA staff should have proven procedures to remediate up to Secret-\nlevel spills to portable computing devices. Remediation of Top Secret, SAP, and SCI spills to\npersonal electronic devices (PED), however, may entail destruction of the hardware.\n\n(3) For Secret-level spills and below, the technical state of the art currently allows for\noverwaiting and sanitization of contaminated media, and reentry of the media into service. There\nis no approved overwniting or sanitization procedure for media that has been contaminated with\nTop Secret, SAP, or SCI data, short of physical destruction. However, such media may continue\nto be used if (re)classified at the higher level, where appropriate.\n\n(4) Early identification of classified spills, and a thorough understanding of where the\nspilled data was sent, is essential to avoid widespread contamination (or re-contamination) of\nback-up servers, tape systems, and off-site storage locations, most of which are configured to run\nnightly or during periods of low usage.\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 107 ENCLOSURE 7",
    "Page_108": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\nh. Classified spills to a personally owned device should also be reported to security officials\nimmediately so remediation can be undertaken as necessary to prevent further unauthorized\ndisclosure.\n\n6. DISPOSAL OF COMPUTER MEDIA\n\n \n\na NSA/CSS publishes lists of products that meet specific performance criteria for sanitizing,\ndestroying or disposing of various types of media containing sensitive or classified information.\nAmong the products identified are those that can be used for erasure of magnetic storage devices\n(e.g., hard drives) and destruction of optical media (e.g., CDs and DVDs). The lists are available\nat http://www.nsa.gov/ia/guidance/media_destruction_guidance/index.shtml or by calling (410)\n854-6358. The NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual, available at that web\naddress, addresses procedures required for sanitization, declassification and release of computer\nstorage devices that have held classified information. Overwriting as a method of clearing\npreviously classified data may be used when the media is reused within the same environment.\nSections 17 and 18 of Enclosure 3 of this Volume provide additional guidance on destruction of\nClassified information.\n\nb. When no longerneeded, UNCLASSIFIED computer systems and hard drives may be\ndisposed of outside the Department of Defense. In some circumstances, the equipment may be\nprovided to non-govemment entities for reutilization. To ensure that no data or information\nremains on operable unclassified hard drives that are transferred or permanently removed from\nDoD custody, the drives must be sanitized by overwriting. Where overwriting is inappropriate or\ncannot be accomplished (e.g., inoperable disk) or the drives are to be totally removed from\nservice (i.e., thrown away), the drives must be destroyed. The specific methods and procedures\ndiffer depending on sensitivity of data and ownership of the hard drive. To ensure DoD\ninformation is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals, the activity security\nmanager should coordinate with the local DAA and/or IT staff to ensure local procedures for\ndisposal of computer hard drives appropriately address removal of U.S. Govemment data prior to\ndisposal. (See Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and\nIntelligence Memorandum (Reference (bt)) for detailed guidance.)\n\n7. NON-TRADITIONAL WORK ENVIRONMENTS. Increasingly, a wide variety of sensitive\nand even classified activities are performed from non-traditional work environments, to include\nemployee homes. In the historic context, this work has principally involved unclassified\ninformation and projects. However, classified IT (e.g., SIPRNET) systems and installations are\nincreasingly being approved for utilization by senior personnel. When such is the case, in\naddition to the requirements of section 12 of Enclosure 2 of this Volume, the following minimum\nphysical and administrative security criteria must be addressed:\n\na. Physical site security survey/analysis. Where prudent, a crime survey may be requested\nfrom local authorities to facilitate understanding of risks associated with the site.\n\n \n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 108 ENCLOSURE 7",

Employee training on classified information systems operation, as well as protection and\nstorage of classified information and COMSEC materials.\n\nc. Provisions for secure storage and/or destruction of any classified information that may be\nrequired or generated (e.g. storage of COMSEC key materials, classified hard drives, and\ndocuments).\n\nd. Application of and compliance with requirements for secunity-in-depth.\n\ne. Written approval for such use of classified information and equipment.\n\n8. REQUIREMENT FOR ENCRY PTION OF CERTAIN UNCLASSIFIED DATA. In\naccordance with DoD policy, all unclassified DoD data that has not been approved for public\nrelease and is stored on mobile computing devices or removable storage media must be\nencrypted using commercially available encryption technology. This requirement includes all\nCUl as well as other unclassified information that has not been reviewed and approved for public\nrelease. See Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration\n(ASD(NII)) Memorandum (Reference (bu)) for detailed guidance.\n\n \n\n9, PI\n\na. PIL, whichis a type of CUI, must be protected from public disclosure in accordance with\nFederal policy, as described in ASD(NIT) Memorandum (Reference (bv)) and Director,\nAdministration and Management Memorandum (Reference (bw)). Some PII also qualifies for\nprotection under the provisions of section 552a of Reference (bk) (also known and hereinafter\nreferred to as “The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended”). Certain PII requires data-at-rest\nencryption and other protections.\n\nb. PII has protection and reporting requirements of which the activity security manager\nshould be aware in the event the loss or unauthorized disclosure of PIT (known as a “breach”) is\nreported to the security office, separately or as part of an unauthorized disclosure of classified\ninformation. Although Privacy Act and/or IT officials are responsible for addressing a breach,\nactivity security managers should be familiar with the protection and breach reporting\nrequirements, the required timeframes for such reports, and the process identified in the DoD\nComponent breach remediation plan for responding to breaches. A breach may trigger a chain of\nrequired actions, including notifications to the USCY BERCOM, United States Computer\nEmergency Readiness Team, the DoD Component Head, and DoD Privacy Act officials. Breach\nreports must be unclassified.\n\n10. NEW TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT. Technology, in general, and IT technology\nspecifically, changes much more quickly than information secunity policy. New products for\ndata storage, communications, access control, and intrusion detection, and new IT equipment and\nperipherals (e.g., hand-held classified devices such as the Secure Mobile Environment PED\n\n \n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 109 ENCLOSURE 7",
    "Page_110": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\n(commonly referred to as “SME PED”)) all have implications, and potential challenges, for\ninformation security. The security manager must remember that the fundamental principles upon\nwhich the information security program resides are still applicable and provide the foundation\nfor dealing with new capabilities. The activity security manager must work with the IAM and\nthe local DAA(s) to identify new risks and develop appropriate procedures to mitigate those\nrisks. Where new policy or procedures are required to address new capabilities, suggested\nupdates and/or issues should be forwarded through the security chain of command to the Director\nof Security, OUSD(I&S).\n\n11. INTERNET-BASED SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES. Use of Intemet-based social\nnetworking services, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and MySpace, is govemed by DoDI\n8170.01 (Reference (bx)). The policy addresses both official use of such capabilities and non-\nofficial use by DoD personnel. It also covers use of other publicly accessible information\ncapabilities and applications available on the Intemet (e.g., wikis, blogs) in locations not owned,\noperated, or controlled by the Department of Defense or the Federal Govemment. As each DoD\nComponent is responsible for ensuring all uses of these services are compliant with information\nsecunity, IA and OPSEC policies and procedures, officials from these disciplines need to\ncoordinate efforts to implement appropriate training, procedures, and oversight. The\nrequirements for protecting classified information and CUI from unauthorized disclosure are the\nsame when using social networking services as when using other media and methods of\ndissemination and the penalties for ignoring the requirements are likewise the same.\n\n12. MARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRONIC INFORMATION. Regardless of\nmedia, the requirement to identify as clearly as possible the information requiring protection\nremains. Where it is not feasible to include markings with all of the information required for\nClassified documents, an explanatory statement that provides the required information shall be\nincluded on the item or with the documentation that accompanies it.\n\na. For specific guidance on marking in an electronic environment, see section 17, Enclosure\n3 of Volume 2 of this Manual, as well as related information in section 16 (briefing slides) and\nparagraph 18.g (removable electronic storage media) of the same enclosure.\n\nb. The use of metadata and other electronic tags, as required by DoDI 8320.02 (Reference\n(by)), to identify the classification level, releasability, and other security attributes of electronic\ndata files can facilitate automated application and enforcement of security measures. However,\nit is imperative that metadata and electronic tags associated with declassified or downgraded\ninformation in electronic format be reviewed and updated or deleted, as necessary, to reflect the\nactual classification and other attributes of the information. Precautions must be taken to ensure\nclassified attributes are not released with unclassified data.\n\n13. PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC TY PES OF INFORMATION\n\na SCI. SCI, regardless of classification level, must be processed only on an information\n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 110 ENCLOSURE 7",
    "Page_111": "DoDM 5200.01-V3, February 24, 2012\n\nsystem accredited for SCI processing (e.g., Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications\nSystem (JWICS)). It may not be processed on, transferred to, or stored on SIPRNET, even if the\ninformation is SECRET//SI, SECRET//HCS, etc., as SIPRNET is not accredited for SCI. Any\ntransfer to and/or processing of SCI on SIPRNET constitutes a data spillage from a higher to a\nlower-secunty information domain, in accordance with Reference (br).\n\nb. RD and Critical Nuclear Weapons Design Information (CNWDI). RD and CNWDI\nrequire certain access and dissemination controls, as specified by DoDI 5210.02 (Reference\n(bz)), beyond those for other information of a comparable level of security classification.\nRequirements for processing RD or CNWDI are specified in section 12, Enclosure 3 of Volume\n1 of this Manual.\n\n \n\nc. SAP. SAP information, regardless of classification, shall be processed only on an\ninformation system specifically accredited for SAP processing and operating at a classification\nlevel that meets or exceeds the classification level of the SAP data.\n\nd. Controlled Imagery. Information marked “IMCON” (controlled imagery) may not be\nprocessed on SIPRNET or posted to SIPRNET websites without prior approval from the\nNational Geospatial- Intelligence Agency. See Appendix 2, Enclosure 4 of Volume 2 of this\nManual.\n\ne. NATO Information. NATO information, regardless of classification, must be processed\non U.S. goverment CLASSIFIED information systems operating at an appropriate level of\nclassification with encrypted data transport and storage and specifically accredited for NATO\nprocessing, in accordance with the requirements of Reference (ab) and Deputy Secretary of\nDefense Memorandum (Reference (ca)). For further guidance on accreditation, handling and\nprocessing of NATO information, including how to handle data spills involving NATO\ninformation, contact the Central U.S. Registry.\n\nf. CUI. FOUO and other CUI may NOT be posted to publicly-accessible Intemet sites and\nmay NOT be posted to sites whose access is controlled only by domain (e.g., limited to .mil\nand/or .gov) as such restricted access can easily be circumvented. At a minimum, posting CUI to\na website requires certificate-based (e.g., common access card) or password and ID access as\nwell as encrypted transmission using hypertext transfer protocol secure (https) or similar\ntechnology. CUI other than FOUO may have additional posting restrictions. See Deputy\nSecretary of Defense Memorandum (Reference (cb)) for detailed guidance.\n\n14, COMPILATION AND DATA AGGREGATION. The ability to create large databases as\nwell as nearly universal Intemet posting of information makes use of search, data mining, and\nother data correlation tools convenient and easy. All of these capabilities facilitate creation of\nclassified compilations of data. The security manager should consider the potential for creation\nof classified compilations when reviewing Intemet postings, new IT systems, and security\nclassification guides, and, as appropriate, when other classification assistance is requested. See\nEnclosure 4 of Volume 1 of this Manual, for guidance on classification by or as a result of\ncompilation and Enclosure 6 of Volume 1 for considerations relative to Intemet posting of data\n\n \n\nChange 3, 07/28/2020 111 ENCLOSURE 7",
