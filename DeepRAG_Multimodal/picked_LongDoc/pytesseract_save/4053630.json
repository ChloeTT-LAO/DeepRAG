Except for the historical information contained herein, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed below.\n\nItem 1. Business\nGeneral\n\nWe are a leading independent provider of wealth management solutions to financial advisors and institutions. Through our wealth management\nofferings, including Envestnet Advisor Suite and Envestnet | PMC, our asset management arm, we deliver a Web-based gateway to expert,\nobjective, integrated wealth management solutions. By integrating a wide range of investment solutions and services, our technology platform\nprovides financial advisors with the flexibility to address their clients needs. We work with financial advisors who are independent, as well as\nthose who are associated with small or mid-sized financial advisory firms and larger financial institutions, which we refer to as enterprise clients.\nWe focus our technology development efforts and our sales and marketing approach on addressing financial advisors front-, middle- and\nback-office needs. We believe that our investment solutions and services allow financial advisors to be more efficient and effective in the\nactivities critical to their businesses by facilitating client interactions, supporting and enhancing portfolio management and analysis, and\nenabling reliable account support and administration. In addition, we are not controlled by a financial institution, broker-dealer or other entity\noperating in the securities or wealth management industry, which we believe affords us a greater level of independence and impartiality.\n\nOur centrally-hosted technology platform provides financial advisors with the flexibility to choose freely among a wide range of investment\nsolutions, services, investment managers and custodians to identify those that are most appropriate for their clients. Given the flexibility of\n\nchoice it provides, we refer to our technology platform as having open architecture . In addition, our technology platform allows us to add new or\nupgrade existing features and functionality as the industry and financial advisors needs evolve. For instance, in 2010 we added a__ unified\nmanaged household solution that empowers advisors to report and consult on clients accounts that are managed by other institutions or advisors.",
    "Page_5": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nOur technology platform provides financial advisors with the following:\n\nA series of integrated services to help them better serve their clients, including risk assessment and selection of investment\nstrategies, asset allocation models, research and due diligence, portfolio construction, proposal generation and paperwork\npreparation, model management and account rebalancing, account monitoring, customized fee billing, overlay services covering\nasset allocation, tax management and socially responsible investing, aggregated multi-custodian performance reporting and\ncommunication tools, as well as access to a wide range of leading third-party asset custodians;\n\nWeb-based access to a wide range of technology-enabled investment solutions, including:\n\nseparately managed accounts, or SMAs, which allow advisors to offer their investor clients a customized, professionally\nmanaged portfolio of securities with a personalized tax basis;\n\n  \n\nunified managed accounts, or UMAs, which are similar to SMAs but allow the advisor to use different types of\ninvestment vehicles in one account;\n\nadvisor-directed portfolios, where advisors create, implement and maintain their own investment portfolio models to\naddress specific client needs; and\n\nmutual funds and portfolios of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs; and\n\nAccess to a broad range of investment managers and investment strategists, which allow advisors to use the research and\nrecommendations of other investment experts, as well as to our internal investment management and portfolio consulting group,\nPortfolio Management Consultants, or PMC.\nPMC primarily engages in consulting services aimed at providing financial advisors with additional support in addressing their clients needs, as\nwell as the creation of proprietary investment solutions and products. PMC s investment solutions and products include managed account and\nmulti-manager portfolios, mutual fund portfolios and ETF portfolios.\n\nWhile our technology platform is designed for financial advisors working at any size and type of financial services firm, we target our sales and\nmarketing efforts towards:\n\nIndependent financial advisors that are part of small to mid-sized financial advisory firms; and\n\nEnterprise clients. In some cases, enterprise clients establish relationships with more than one platform provider, allowing their\nfinancial advisors to choose the technology platform that best supports their needs. In these cases, we focus our sales efforts on the\nfirm s affiliated financial advisors to demonstrate the distinguishing features of our technology solutions and to work with them on\ntransitioning their onto our technology platform. Other enterprise clients hire us to be their exclusive technology platform\nprovider, and all financial advisors with that firm will transition their client accounts to our technology platform.\nOur small to mid-sized customers include registered investment advisors, or RIAs, which are financial advisors registered with a state securities\ncommissioner and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and who typically receive fees based on a percentage of the client assets\nthey manage, independent broker-dealers, or IBDs, which provide processing and oversight for their affiliated financial advisors who are\nregistered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and dually registered advisors, which are financial advisors registered\nwith both the SEC and FINRA.",
    "Page_6": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\nWe earn revenues primarily under two pricing models. First, a majority of our revenues are derived from fees charged as a percentage of the\nassets that are managed or administered on our technology platform by financial advisors. Our asset-based fees vary based on the types of\ninvestment solutions and services that financial advisors utilize. Asset-based fees accounted for approximately 78%, 73% and 77% of our total\nrevenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $64 billion of\ninvestment assets for which we receive asset-based fees were managed or administered utilizing our technology platform by approximately\n13,800 financial advisors in approximately 307,000 investor accounts.",
    "Page_7": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nSecond, we generate revenues from recurring, contractual licensing fees for providing access to our technology platform, generally from a small\nnumber of enterprise clients. Licensing fees are generally fixed for the contract term and are based on the level and types of investment solutions\nand services provided, rather than on the amount of client assets on our technology platform. Generally, our licensing contracts range from two\nto five years and have annual renewal provisions. Licensing fees accounted for 19%, 24% and 20% of our total revenues for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Fees received in connection with professional services accounted for the remainder of our total\nrevenues. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $76 billion of investment assets for which we receive licensing fees for utilizing our\ntechnology platform were serviced by approximately 7,700 financial advisors through approximately 604,000 investor accounts.\n\nFor over 85% of our asset-based fee arrangements, we bill customers at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer\nassets on our technology platform as of the end of the prior quarter, providing for a high degree of visibility for the current quarter. Furthermore,\nour licensing fees are highly predictable because they are generally set in multi-year contracts providing longer term visibility regarding a\nportion of our total revenues.\n\nThe following table sets forth the assets that were managed or administered on our technology platform by financial advisors as of the end of the\nquarters indicated:",

    "Page_9": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nOur Market Opportunity\n\nThe wealth management industry has experienced significant growth in terms of assets invested by retail investors in the past several years.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household and non-profit organization financial assets totaled $45.7 trillion as of September 30, 2010, up\nfrom $44.3 trillion in 2009 and $33.3 trillion in 2003. According to Cerulli Associates, an industry research firm, as of December 31, 2009, $9.5\ntrillion of assets were professionally managed for retail investors compared to $6.8 trillion as of December 31, 2003. In addition, according to\nCerulli Associates, in 2009, there were approximately 334,000 financial advisors registered with FINRA or the SEC that were focused on retail\ninvestors.\n\nIn addition to experiencing significant growth in financial assets, the wealth management industry is characterized by a number of important\ntrends, including those described below, which we believe create a significant market opportunity for technology-enabled investment solutions\nand services like ours.\n\nIncreased prevalence of independent financial advisors. Based on industry news reports, we believe that over the past several years an\nincreasing percentage of financial advisors have elected to leave large financial institutions and start their own financial advisory practices or\nmove to smaller, more independent firms. In 2010, according to the Investment News database called Advisors on the Move, $79 billion in\nassets shifted advisory channels. The independent channel was the only channel to realize asset gains (approximately $16 billion). Wirehouses,\nregional broker-dealers, insurance and bank broker-dealers all experience net asset outflows.\n\nThese independent firms include IBDs for FINRA-registered financial advisors, RIAs working as sole practitioners or as part of small firms with\nSEC registrations, and dually registered financial advisors. We believe, based on our industry experience, that this trend was accelerated in the\npast two to three years as a result of the reputational harm suffered by several of the largest financial institutions during the recent financial\n\ncrisis. In particular, according to Cerulli Associates, an estimated 40% of financial advisors were considered independent in 2009, and 47% of\nfinancial advisors will be independent by the end of 2014, implying that the percentage of financial advisors employed by large financial\ninstitutions (wirehouse, regional, insurance and bank) will shrink from 60% in 2009 to 53% in 2014.\n\n \n\nMoreover, according to projections by Cerulli Associates, the percentage of assets invested by retail clients with independent financial advisors\nis expected to rise from 30% in 2007 to 37% in 2012, while the wirehouse market share will shrink from 48% in 2007 to 33% in 2012.\n\nIncreased reliance on technology among independent financial advisors. In order to compete effectively in the marketplace, independent\nfinancial advisors are increasingly relying on technology service providers to help them provide comparable services cost effectively and\nefficiently, according to Cerulli Associates. In addition, IBDs and RIA firms have been incented to enhance the sop! cation of their\ntechnology platforms in order to attract financial advisors from larger financial institutions, according to Cerulli Associates. In addition, we\nbelieve, based on a report from Cerulli Associates, that financial advisors generally favor technology solutions that enable them to spend more\ntime on asset allocation, fund and manager selection and client interaction, rather than on administrative or technology-related activities. Based\non a report from Cerulli Associates, we believe that advanced technological support is a key driver for growth in an independent financial\nadvisor s business. For example, an advanced technology platform with fully integrated tools helps reduce the need for the manual processing of\ndata and the use of multiple incompatible technology applications, allowing financial advisors to spend more time interacting with their clients,\nwhile also potentially allowing the financial advisor to reduce technology-related costs.\n\n \n\nIncreased use of financial advisors. We believe, based on an analysis done by Cerulli Associates, that the recent significant volatility and\nincreasing complexity in securities markets have resulted in increased investor interest in receiving professional financial advisory services.\nAccording to Cerulli Associates, 56% of households use one or more financial advisors. Following the market recession and amidst low\nconfidence ratings for advisors, investors are increasingly implementing additional advisory relationships as a method to test drive",
    "Page_10": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nadvisors in order to compare performance and service. Independent financial advisors are well positioned to attract clients interested in managed\naccount solutions over the next three years. According to Cerulli Associates, from December 31, 2002 to June 30, 2010, retail managed account\nassets with independent financial advisor accounts grew from 17% to 27% of total separate account assets. In addition, according to Cerulli\nAssociates, financial advisors that serve as portfolio managers have had their assets under management grow at a compound annual growth rate\nof 25% from $62 billion in 2002 to $351 billion as of June 30, 2010.\n\n \n\nIncreased use of fee-based investment solutions. Retail investor assets in managed accounts exceeded $2 trillion in September 2010. Based on\nour industry experience, we believe that in order for financial advisors to effectively manage their clients assets, we believe they are utilizing\naccount types that offer the flexibility to choose among the widest range of investment solutions. Financial advisors typically charge their clients\nfees for these types of flexible accounts based on a percentage of assets rather than on a commission or other basis. According to Cerulli\nAssociates, the percentage of commission-only financial advisors declined from 18% in 2003 to 11% in 2010. In addition, according to\ninformation provided by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, revenues from asset management fees (fee based revenue)\nincreased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 11% from 1990 to 2010, while revenues based on commissions increased at a\ncompound annual growth rate of approximately 5% during the same period. Based on these trends, we believe that financial advisors will\nincreasingly require a sophisticated technology platform to support their changing practice patterns and their ability to address their clients\nneeds.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMore stringent standards applicable to financial advisors. In light of the economic crisis and related securities market volatility in 2008 and\n2009, we believe that there will be increased attention on investor consumer protection, whether as a result of regulatory changes, voluntary\nindustry initiatives or competitive dynamics. Increased scrutiny of financial advisors to ensure compliance with current laws, coupled with the\npossibility of new laws focused on a fiduciary standard, may require changes to the way financial advisors offer advice. In order to adapt to these\nchanges, we believe that financial advisors will benefit from utilizing a technology platform, such as ours, that allows them to address their\nclients wealth management needs, manage and memorialize decisions made throughout the process, and that assists them with recordkeeping\nand account monitoring.\n\nOur Growth Strategy\n\nWe intend to increase our revenue and profitability by continuing to pursue the following strategies:\n\nIncrease the advisor base within our existing enterprise clients. Through the outreach and marketing activities of our regional\nsales and client service teams, we intend to continue the process of leveraging our existing enterprise client relationships to add\nnew financial advisors to our technology platform. Generally, when we establish an enterprise client relationship, we are provided\naccess to the client s financial advisors and given the opportunity to move them to our technology platform. During the past five\nyears, the number of financial advisors using our technology platform from existing enterprise clients has grown at a compound\nannual growth rate of 10%. Despite that growth, we have the opportunity to continue increasing the number of financial advisors\nwe serve within our existing enterprise client relationships.\n\nExtend the account base within a given advisor relationship. As our working relationships with our financial advisor customers\ndevelop over time, and through our sales and marketing efforts, we will seek to move more of their clients assets onto our\ntechnology platform. During the five year period ending December 31, 2010, the average number of AUM or AUA accounts per\nadvisor on our technology platform has grown from approximately 11 to 22, an increase of 100%. As a result, total AUM or AUA\naccounts have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 45% from December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2010.\n\n \n\nExpand the services we provide each advisor. In many cases, when we first enter into a client relationship with a financial\nadvisor, the financial advisor utilizes some, but not all, of the investment solutions and services provided through our technology\nplatform. Accordingly, through our sales and\n\n \n\n10",
    "Page_11": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nmarketing efforts, we will continue to educate our financial advisor customers regarding our company in order to expand the\nscope of our investment solutions and services they employ.\n\nObtain new enterprise clients. New enterprise clients provide us with access to a large number of financial advisors that may be\ninterested in utilizing our technology platform, as well as to the assets under management or administration that are managed by\nthese financial advisors. In most cases, a new enterprise client will provide us with the opportunity to attract a large number of\nfinancial advisors to our technology platform over time. In other cases, new enterprise clients elect to convert all or a significant\nportion of the assets on their platform to our technology platform, with the financial advisors managing such assets migrating onto\nour platform at the time of the asset conversion. We believe that the current market opportunity for enterprise conversions is\nsignificant, particularly compared to recent historical levels. New enterprise clients also provide further opportunities to execute\non the other strategies discussed above.\n\nContinue to invest in our technology platform. To continue to attract and retain enterprise clients and financial advisors, and to\ndeepen our relationships with them, we intend to continue to invest in our technology platform to provide financial advisors with\naccess to investment solutions and services that address the widest range of the financial advisors front-, middle- and back-office\nneeds. In the years ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, we had technology development\nexpenditures totaling $4.9 million, $4.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively. We expect that we will have similar levels of\ntechnology development expenses in 2011. We will continue to invest to develop our technology platform to provide access to\ninvestment solutions and services from a wide range of leading third-party providers, while also continuing to enhance the\ninvestment solutions and services we offer through PMC.\n\n \n\nContinue to pursue transactions and other relationships. Though we have no transactions planned currently, we intend to\ncontinue to selectively pursue acquisitions, investments and other relationships that we believe can significantly enhance the\nattractiveness of our technology platform or expand our client base. We characterize these acquisitions, investments and other\nrelationships as either strategic or consolidating transactions. We pursue strategic transactions in order to add new functionality to\nour technology platform or to enhance our existing functionality. Consolidating transactions, such as our 2010 platform services\nagreement with FundQuest, present opportunities for us to utilize the operating efficiency that results from our significant scale of\noperations. We believe we have been successful historically in identifying and executing transactions that have complemented our\nbusiness and allowed us to compete more effectively in our industry. Given our scale of operations and record of past transactions,\nwe believe we are well positioned to engage in such transactions in the future.\n\nOur Business Model\n\nWe believe that a number of attractive characteristics significantly contribute to the success of our business model, including:\n\nAttractive business model with operating leverage. Because we have designed our systems architecture to accommodate growth\nin the number of advisors and accounts and to provide the flexibility to add new investment solutions and services, our technology\nplatform and infrastructure allow us to grow our business efficiently, without the need for significant additional expenditures as\nassets grow and with low marginal costs required to add additional accounts and new investment solutions and services.\nFurthermore, once we have contracted with a financial advisor and transitioned the associated assets to our technology platform,\nwe are able to add additional assets to our technology platform with minimal incremental costs. This enables us to generate\nsubstantial operating leverage during the course of our relationship with a financial advisor as the assets of the advisor s clients\ngrow, through the addition of advisors utilizing our technology platform and through the financial advisors use of additional\ninvestment solutions and services.\n\n \n\n11",
    "Page_12": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nRecurring and resilient revenue base. The substantial majority of our revenues is recurring and is derived either from asset-based\nfees, which are billed at the beginning of each quarter and from fixed fees under multi-year license agreements. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2010, we derived 77% and 23% of our total revenues from asset-based fees and from licensing and professional\nservices revenues, respectively.\n\nStrong customer retention. We believe that the breadth of access to investment solutions and the multitude of services that we\nprovide allow financial advisors to address a wide range of their clients needs and, as a result, financial advisors are less likely to\nmove away from our technology platform. Because a technology platform is involved in nearly all of a financial advisor s\nactivities needed to serve their clients, once a financial advisor has moved clients and their assets onto our technology platform,\nsignificant time, costs and/or resources would be required for the financial advisor to shift to another technology platform.\n\nFavorable industry trends. As an independent provider of technology services to financial advisors, we believe we are well\n\npositioned to take advantage of favorable secular trends in the wealth management industry, particularly the growth in investable\n\nassets, the movement toward independent financial advisors and fee-based pricing structures and increased use of technology.\nOur Technology Platform\n\nOur proprietary Web-based technology platform provides financial advisors with access to investment solutions and services that address, in one\nintegrated, centrally-hosted platform, what we believe, based on our knowledge of the industry, is the widest range of front-, middle- and\nback-office needs in our industry. The open architecture design of our technology platform provides financial advisors with flexibility in terms\nof the investment solutions and services they access, and configurability in the manner in which the financial advisors utilize particular\ninvestment solutions and services. The multitenant architecture of the platform ensures that this level of flexibility and customization is achieved\nwithout requiring us to create unique application instances for each client, thereby reducing the need for additional technology personnel and\nassociated expenses. In addition, though our technology platform is designed to deliver a breadth of functions, financial advisors are able to\nselect from the various investment solutions and services we offer, without being required to subscribe to or purchase more than what they\nbelieve is necessary.\n\n10\n\n12",

Our technology platform integrates with a number of financial planning tools such as Monte Carlo\nsimulations, portfolio diagnostics and estate and retirement planning that enables financial advisors to create and implement a financial plan that\nis tailored to each client s investment goals, risk tolerance and assets. For example, financial advisors can create a time-segmented distribution\nportfolio based on a client s retirement goals. Each segment is constructed as an individual portfolio, with its own criteria for risk tolerance and\ninvestment objectives. Once created, the financial advisor can run goals-based reports to track the progress of the retirement investments.\n\n \n\nPortfolio Analysis. Our technology platform provides financial advisors with a customizable risk tolerance questionnaire to complete with\nclients. The questionnaire assists financial advisors in understanding the investment objectives and preferences of their clients.

Our technology platform provides financial advisors with significant flexibility in determining the appropriate asset\nallocation strategy for their clients at either the account or household level. The financial advisor may utilize asset allocation recommendations\ndesigned by the financial advisor, the financial advisor s employer or affiliated financial institution, an outside third-party asset manager or\nrecommendations that are provided through our technology platform. As further described below, through our technology platform s overlay\nservices, our PMC group can provide ongoing review and monitoring of asset allocation decisions in order to make adjustments that may be\nnecessary to respond to changing market conditions or client circumstances.\n\nResearch and Due Diligence. Our technology platform provides financial advisors with extensive resources to research and review information\nrelating to third-party asset managers, investment solutions and other related services that the financial advisor may elect to recommend to\nclients. Through our technology platform, the financial advisor may utilize research and due diligence capabilities that are provided by the\nadvisor s firm, third-party service providers or PMC. The information obtained through research and due diligence activities may be organized\nand presented in highly customizable formats depending on the needs of the financial advisor s clients. Examples of such information include\nin-depth manager profiles, side-by-side manager comparison of performance and other portfolio statistics and product profiles highlighting\nperformance versus the appropriate benchmark.\n\n \n\nPortfolio Construction. Once investment objectives, risk tolerance and asset allocation have been determined, and the financial advisor has\ncompleted any necessary research and due diligence, our technology platform allows the financial advisor to select investment solutions using a\nwide range of portfolio construction tools. The portfolio construction process is highly flexible, allowing the financial advisor to select the\ninvestment solutions, including through the creation of model portfolios, or to engage outside investment managers to assist in, or completely\nundertake, portfolio construction.\n\n \n\nInvestment Program Selection. Once the investment solutions have been selected, our technology platform, through relationships we have\nestablished with a variety of investment managers, allows the financial advisor to access and choose from a wide range of investment programs,\nincluding separately managed accounts, unified managed accounts, third-party strategist programs, mutual fund and exchange-traded fund\nprograms, and others, depending on the financial advisor sment of the client s needs. Because our technology platform supports nearly\nevery investment program type that is currently available, financial advisors are able to keep more of a client s assets on one technology platform,\nthereby simplifying the operation of their business, saving time and lowering costs.\n\n \n\nPMC, Envestnet s Portfolio Consulting Group. Our PMC group provides consulting services aimed at providing financial advisors with\nadditional support in addressing their clients needs, including asset allocation modeling, asset manager and mutual fund due diligence, selection\nand ongoing monitoring, investment portfolio construction and overlay services, principally relating to ongoing portfolio management and asset\nallocation rebalancing. Our PMC group also creates proprietary investment solutions and products, including separate account strategies,\nmulti-manager portfolios, mutual funds, mutual fund wrap and ETF asset allocation strategies.\n\nProposal Generation and Fee Calculation. Our technology platform provides financial advisors with a flexible proposal and presentation tool\nthat is capable of creating highly customized documents. Presentations and proposals may be prepared utilizing the financial advisor s\n\npersonalized branding and content, while also integrating the client s particular investment account information. In addition, extensive fee-related\ninformation may be prepared and included in such presentations or proposals.\n\n12\n\n14",
    "Page_15": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nAccount Opening and Servicing. Once the financial advisor has entered the information necessary for generating account documents, the forms\nneeded to open the account can be generated with information pre-populated, such as the client s name and address, making the account-opening\nprocess less onerous for the end client. The forms are automatically generated with the investment proposal and are ready for the client s\nsignature. Once the documents are signed, the documents will be processed according to agreed-upon workflow procedures.\n\nCustodial and Trading Interface. Our technology platform provides financial advisors with access to 14 third-party custodians, real-time data\nand Web-based service tools. In addition, the open architecture design of our technology platform allows us to respond to financial advisors\nneeds that may not be currently addressed by our technology platform, including, for example, establishing relationships with additional\ncustodians or third-party asset managers. Our technology platform also supports financial advisors through the management of account\npaperwork and by facilitating communications with any third-party asset managers that the financial advisor may have engaged.\n\nPortfolio Overlay and Rebalancing. Once a financial advisor has created a client account and selected investment solutions and programs, our\ntechnology platform provides access to ongoing account management services, PMC portfolio managers review all PMC models and proprietary\nportfolios to determine when to rebalance across asset classes. Emphasis is placed on strict adherence to the paramaters set for each portfolio. In\naddition, we offer overlay services that can help enhance an advisor s ability to carry out his or her fiduciary responsibility. These services\ninclude ongoing review of investment portfolios for compliance with asset allocation criteria, with rebalancing recommendations made as\nnecessary, assistance with investment portfolio tax management and review of investment accounts to ensure that investment decisions are\n\ntent with the client s investment objectives. We also offer a socially responsible overlay (the Sustainability Platform) which the financial\nadvisor may use to assist with maintain compliance with clients investment restrictions. These may include securities issued by specific\ncompanies or from issuers in certain industries that clients want to exclude from their investment accounts.\n\n   \n\n \n\nReporting Solutions. Our technology platform is capable of producing highly configurable aggregated reports showing holdings, investment\nperformance, capital gains and losses and other information for financial advisors to provide to their clients that can be downloaded, viewed\non-line or printed. In addition, through our India operations, our technology platform provides financial advisors with access to client account\ndata reconciled daily with records maintained by multiple custodians. Accordingly, when securities markets open each day, financial advisors\nhave the most up-to-date account data available.\n\nBilling and Account Administration. Our technology platform supports a wide range of fee and billing structures. These include breakpoint\npricing, where lower fee rates are applied as asset levels meet or exceed pre-established thresholds, fees based on aggregated client funds across\nseveral accounts held by family members, fees tailored to different investment programs and investment solution types and other customized fee\nand billing arrangements. Account administration includes account set-up, asset manager set-up, account funding and back-office administration.\n\n    \n\nCompliance and Fiduciary Notes. Envestnet has created industry leading technology to help advisors and home offices track and maintain their\nown proprietary fiduciary process. Our technology platform includes configurable Fiduciary Oversight Notes (FONs) that help advisors\nunderstand implications of the decisions they make via educational text boxes, and then memorialize those decisions for client service and\nreporting. The FONs may be searched and reviewed by home offices or the advisors themselves.\n\nCommunication and Education. Based on our discussions with financial advisors, we believe that for financial advisors who operate within\nlarge financial institutions, the ability to communicate quickly and effectively with supervisors or firm management is important. Our\ntechnology platform provides supervisors or firm management with the ability to distribute to financial advisors notifications and\nannouncements regarding changes to manager portfolios, platform maintenance, account activity and other related information. Resources are\nalso available to assist financial advisors with practice management and education.\n\n13\n\n15",

The consulting\nservices are focused on asset allocation modeling, asset manager and mutual fund due diligence, selection and ongoing\n\nmonitoring, investment portfolio construction and overlay services, principally relating to ongoing portfolio management and\n\nasset allocation rebalancing.\n\nCreation of proprietary investment solutions and products, including separate account strategies, multi-manager portfolios, mutual\nfunds, mutual fund wrap and ETF portfolios. PMC s investment solutions and products are discussed below.\nPMC s Investment Solutions and Products\n\nPMC provides a wide range of investment solutions and products aimed at addressing different investor objectives and risk profiles. PMC s\ninvestment solutions and products include:\n\nManaged Account and Multi-Manager Portfolios. PMC provides financial advisors with access to SMAs, which allow advisors\nto offer their investor clients a customized, professionally-managed portfolio of securities with a personalized tax basis, manager\nblend portfolios, which utilize several asset managers to provide clients with diversification across multiple investment styles and\nasset classes within a single investment account, and multi-manager accounts, which provide clients, within a single investment\naccount, with access to multiple separate account managers and mutual fund products in order to obtain diversification across\nasset classes, investment styles and investment products. PMC also conducts research and due diligence on a number of the\nseparate asset managers to which it provides access.\n\n    \n\n   \n\n \n\nMutual Fund Portfolios. PMC offers a range of packaged mutual fund portfolios aimed at helping financial advisors address\ndifferent client needs. These mutual fund portfolios include a series of products marketed under the SIGMA Mutual Fund\n\nSolutions brand, which provide for different allocations of a variety of equity- and fixed income-focused mutual funds tailored to\naddress investors differing investment time horizons, portfolios of mutual funds marketed under the PMC Select Portfolios brand,\nwhich are tailored to be more attractive to smaller account sizes because they feature a full range of asset allocation targets built to\nmeet various investment and risk levels in a single investment vehicle, portfolios of mutual funds marketed under the PMC\nEnhanced Portfolio Strategies brand, which offer asset class diversification strategies in a traditional mutual fund structure, and\nportfolios of mutual funds marketed under the PMC Ultra Short Term Fixed Income brand, which offer a fixed income portfolio\naimed at providing investors with an attractive alternative to money market fund yields.\n\nETF Portfolios. PMC also offers pre-packaged portfolios of ETFs, ranging from products that simply track movements in a\nspecified securities index to tailored products that are designed to outperform broad market indexes by focusing on expected\nincreases in the value of securities issued by certain companies or issuers in specified industries.\n\nOur Customers\n\nIndependent financial advisors that are working alone or as part of small to mid-sized financial advisory firms. Our principal value\nproposition aimed at independent financial advisors working alone or as part of small to mid-sized firms is that our technology platform allows\nthem to compete effectively with financial advisors employed by large financial institutions. We provide independent financial advisors with\naccess to as many or more of the investment solutions and services that are typically available to financial advisors working at the larger firms.\nAn example of one our smaller independent financial advisor clients is Commonwealth.\n\n \n\n14\n\n16",

We provide enterprise clients with a customized, private-labeled technology platform that enables them to support their\naffiliated financial advisors with a broad range of investment solutions and services. Our contracts with enterprise clients establish the applicable\nterms and conditions, including pricing terms, service level agreements and basic platform configurations. For the years ended December 31,\n2008, 2009 and 2010, revenues associated with our relationship with our single largest enterprise client, FMR LLC, an affiliate of FMR Corp., or\nFidelity, accounted for 27%, 31% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenues. Though a loss of this client could have a material adverse effect\non our results of operations, financial condition and business, in such event, we would evaluate the need to reduce costs and take other steps to\nattempt to mitigate the effects of the loss of such client. Such other steps may include, if necessary and appropriate, reduction of our operating\nexpenses, including a reduction of our workforce. In the event that we were to lose Fidelity as a customer, though we would continue our\nongoing efforts to attract new customers, we can provide no assurances that we would be successful in obtaining new customers that would\nreplace all or any part of the revenues represented by our relationship with Fidelity. No other client accounted for more than 10% of our total\nrevenues. Examples of our other enterprise clients include Northwestern Mutual, National Financial Partners, National Planning Holdings and\nRussell Investments.\n\n \n\nSales and Marketing\n\nOur sales and marketing staff is divided into three teams. The Enterprise Sales team, made up of 11 employees, focuses on entering into\nagreements with enterprise clients. The Advisory Sales team has 8 regions, 27 employees and is focused on selling to the individual financial\nadvisors of IBDs and entering into agreements with RIA firms pursuant to which the financial advisors agree to convert some or all of their\nclients onto our technology platform. Our third sales and marketing team has 8 employees from our PMC group. This team is focused on\nassisting financial advisors with constructing client portfolios and provides information regarding PMC s proprietary investment solutions and\nproducts.\n\nThe principal aim of our marketing efforts is to create greater visibility of our company and provide thought leadership to the wealth\nmanagement industry. Our marketing efforts are focused on our core markets: financial advisors and enterprise clients. We use advertising and\npublic relations to communicate our message to these target markets. Examples of these marketing efforts include:\n\nquotes in wealth management industry publications regarding our views on financial advisor trends and challenges;\n\nadvertising and other marketing materials promoting our investment solutions and services;\n\nfrequent participation in industry conferences and tradeshows, including events sponsored by our custodian partners, by making\npresentations and speaking on panels;\n\nhosting conferences on wealth management solutions;\n\nproviding insights on industry trends through internal research and sponsoring and writing industry white papers; and\n\ncreating marketing tools for financial advisors to better communicate with their current and prospective clients.\nTo implement our marketing efforts, we generally employ paid print and online advertisements in a variety of industry publications, as well as\npromotions that include e-blast campaigns and sponsored webinars. We also partner with IBDs on direct mail campaigns targeting such firms\nfinancial advisors to describe the investment solutions and services that we offer, produce brochures and presentations for financial advisors to\nuse with their clients and we create Internet pages or sites to promote our investment solutions and services.\n\nCompetition\n\nWe generally compete on the basis of several factors, including the breadth and quality of investment solutions and services to which we provide\naccess through our technology platform, the number of custodians\n\n17",

Our\ncompetitors offer a variety of products and services that compete with one or more of the investment solutions and services provided through our\ntechnology platform, although, based on our industry experience, we believe that none offer the same comprehensive set of products and\nservices that we do. Our principal competitors include:\n\nCustodians. A number of leading asset custodians, such as Pershing (a subsidiary of BNY Mellon Corporation) and The Charles\nSchwab Corporation, have expanded beyond their custodial businesses to also offer advisor trading tools that compete with our\nfinancial advisor-directed solutions.\n\nTurnkey Asset Management Platform Providers. Providers of turnkey asset management platforms, including SEI Investments\nCompany, Genworth Financial Inc. and Lockwood Advisors (a subsidiary of BNY Mellon Corporation), typically provide\nfinancial advisors with one or more types of products and services but generally offer fewer choices in terms of custodians, asset\nmanagers, technology features and functionality.\n\nProviders of Specific Service Applications. A number of our competitors provide financial advisors with a product or service\ndesigned to address one specific issue or need, such as financial planning or performance reporting. While our technology\nplatform also provides access to these investment solutions or services, financial advisors may elect to utilize a single application\nrather than a fully integrated platform.\n\nTechnology\n\nOur technology platform features a three-tier architecture integrating a Web-based user interface, an application tier that houses the Java-based\nbusiness logic for all of the platform s functionality and a SQL Server database. The application tier resides behind load balancers which\ndistribute the workload demands across our servers. We believe our technology design allows for significant scalability.\n\nWe devote significant resources to ensuring sufficient platform capacity and system uptime. In 2010, our actual uptime was 99.8%. We have\n\nachieved Type I and Type II SAS70 compliance with our platform and we maintain multiple redundancies, back up our databases and safeguard\ntechnologies and proprietary information consistent with industry best practices. We also maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan and\ncompany-wide risk assessment program that is consistent with industry best practices and that complies with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n \n\nWe have historically made significant investments in platform development in order to enhance and expand our technology platform and expect\nto continue to make significant investments in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010,\nwe incurred technology development expenditures totaling approximately $4.9 million, $4.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Of these\nexpenditures, we capitalized approximately $1.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively, as internally developed software. We\nexpect to continue focusing our technology development efforts principally on adding strategic features to increase our market competitiveness,\nenhancements to improve operating efficiency and reduce risk and client-driven requests for new capabilities.\n\nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual\nproperty. We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, customers and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our\nbehalf be kept confidential. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted\nuse agreements.

We also use encryption techniques for data\ntransmissions. We control and limit access to confidential and proprietary information on a need to know _ basis.\n\n \n\nRegulation\nOverview\n\nThe financial services industry is among the most extensively regulated industries in the United States. We operate investment advisory,\nbroker-dealer and mutual fund businesses, each of which is subject to a specific regulatory scheme, including regulation at the Federal and state\nlevel, as well as regulation by self-regulatory organizations and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to numerous laws\nand regulations of general application.\n\nOur wholly-owned subsidiaries, Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., Portfolio Management Consultants, Inc. and Oberon Financial Technology,\nInc. operate investment advisory businesses. These subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as_ investment advisers under the Advisers Act, and\nare regulated thereunder. As described further below, many of our investment advisory programs are conducted pursuant to the non-exclusive\nsafe harbor from the definition of an investment company provided for under Rule 3a-4 under the Investment Company Act. If Rule 3a-4 were to\ncease to be available, or if the SEC were to modify the rule or its interpretation of how the rule is applied, it could have a substantial effect on\nour business. Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. serves as the investment adviser to four mutual funds. Mutual funds are registered as\n\ninvestment companies under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, together with related\nregulations and interpretations of the SEC, impose numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including\nrecordkeeping requirements, limitations on advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities, and detailed\noperating requirements, including restrictions on transactions between an adviser and its clients, and between a mutual fund and its advisers and\naffiliates. The fiduciary obligations of investment advisers to their clients require advisers to, among other things, consider the suitability of the\ninvestment products and advice they provide, seek best execution for their clients securities transactions, conduct due diligence on third-party\nproducts offered to clients, consider the appropriateness of the adviser s fees, and provide extensive and ongoing disclosure to clients. The\napplication of these requirements to wrap fee programs is particularly complex and the SEC has in the past scrutinized firms compliance with\nthese requirements. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose fines and sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the\nInvestment Company Act and has the power to restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to\ncomply with applicable laws and regulations. Though we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the\nAdvisers Act and the Investment Company Act and the rules and interpretations promulgated thereunder, our failure to comply with such laws,\nrules and interpretations could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n \n\nPortfolio Brokerage Services, Inc., or PBS, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, PBS is a member of FINRA, the securities\nindustry self-regulatory organization that supervises and regulates the conduct and activities of broker-dealers. Broker-dealers are subject to\nregulations that cover all aspects of their business, including sales practices, market making and trading among broker-dealers, use and\nsafekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct\n\n17\n\n20",

FINRA and the SEC conduct periodic examinations of the operations of\nits members, including PBS. Violation of applicable regulations can result in the suspension or revocation of a broker-dealer s registration, the\nimposition of censures or fines and the suspension or expulsion of the broker-dealer from FINRA. PBS is subject to minimum net capital\nrequirements under the Exchange Act, SEC and FINRA rules and conducts its business pursuant to the exemption from the SEC s customer\nprotection rule provided by Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2010, PBS was required to maintain a minimum\nof $100,000 in net capital and its actual net capital was $714,000.\n\n    \n\nOur regulated subsidiaries are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that grant supervisory agencies, including the SEC, broad\nadministrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with these laws and regulations, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include\nthe suspension of individual employees, limitations on the permissibility of our regulated subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries to engage in\nbusiness for specified periods of time, censures, fines, and the revocation of registration as a broker-dealer or investment adviser, as applicable.\nAdditionally, the securities laws applicable to us and our subsidiaries provide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil\nlitigation. Any litigation could have significant financial and non-financial consequences including monetary judgments and the requirement to\ntake action or limit activities that could ultimately affect our business.\n\n \n\nAdditional legislation and regulations, including those relating to the activities of investment advisers and broker-dealers, changes in rules\nimposed by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing\nla nd rules may adversely affect our business and profitability. Our businesses may be materially affected not only by regulations applicable\nto it as an investment adviser or broker-dealer, but also by regulations that apply to companies generally.\n\n \n\nInvestment Advisory Program, Conducted Under Rule 3a-4\n\nUnder the Investment Company Act, an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities may be deemed an\n\ninvestment company, in which case the issuer may be subject to registration requirements and regulation as an investment company under the\nInvestment Company Act. In order to provide assurance that certain discretionary investment advisory programs would not be considered\ninvestment companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 3a-4 under the Investment Company Act, which provides a\nnon-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an investment company for programs that meet the requirements of the rule. We conduct the\nfollowing programs pursuant to the Rule 3a-4 safe harbor:\n\nSeparately managed accounts;\n\nUnified managed accounts portfolios;\n\nMutual fund portfolios and exchange-traded funds _ portfolios; and\n\nAdvisor directed portfolios.\nWe believe that, to the extent we exercise discretion over accounts in any of these programs, these programs qualify for the safe-harbor because\nall of the programs have the following characteristics, which are generally required in order for a program to be eligible for the Rule 3a-4 safe\nharbor:\n\nEach client account is managed on the basis of the client s financial situation, investment objectives and reasonable client-imposed\ninvestment restrictions;\n\nAt the opening of the account, the clients financial advisor obtains information from the client and provides us with the client s\nfinancial situation, investment objectives and reasonable restrictions;\n\n21",

In addition, some of our clients have developed or may develop the in-house capability to\nprovide the technology and/or investment advisory services they have retained us to perform. These clients may also offer internally developed\nservices to their financial advisors, obviating the need to hire us, and they may offer these services to third-party financial advisors or financial\ninstitutions, thereby competing directly with us for that business.\n\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. These resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to\nchanges in demand for investment solutions and services, to devote greater resources to developing and promoting their services and to make\nmore attractive offers to potential clients and strategic partners, which could hurt our financial performance.\n\nWe may lose clients as a result of the sale or merger of a client, a change in a client s senior management, competition from other financial\nadvisors and financial institutions and for other reasons. We also face increased competition due to the current trend of industry consolidation. If\nlarge financial institutions that are not our clients are able to attract assets from our clients, our ability to generate future growth in revenues and\nearnings may be adversely affected.\n\nOur failure to successfully compete in any of the above-mentioned areas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\nfinancial condition or business. Competition could also affect the revenue mix of services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of\nbusiness with higher profit margins.\n\nWe derive nearly all of our revenues from the delivery of investment solutions and services to clients in the financial advisory industry\nand our revenue could suffer if that industry experiences a downturn.\n\nWe derive nearly all of our revenues from the delivery of investment solutions and services to clients in the financial advisory industry and we\nare therefore subject to the risks affecting that industry. A decline or lack of growth in demand for financial advisory services would adversely\naffect our clients and, in turn, our results of operations, financial condition and business. For example, the availability of free or low-cost\ninvestment information and resources, including research and information relating to publicly traded companies and mutual funds available on\nthe Internet or on company websites, could lead to lower demand by investors for the services provided by financial advisors. In addition,\ndemand for our investment solutions and services among financial advisors could decline for many reasons. Consolidation or limited growth in\nthe financial advisory industry could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. Events that adversely affect our clients businesses,\nrates of growth or the numbers of customers they serve, including decreased demand for our clients products and services, adverse conditions in\nour clients markets or adverse economic conditions generally, could decrease demand for our investment solutions and services and thereby\ndecrease our revenues. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\nA limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue. Termination of our contracts with any of these clients could\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, revenues associated with our relationship with our single largest client, FMR LLC, an\naffiliate of FMR Corp., or Fidelity, accounted for 27%, 31% and 31% respectively, of our total revenues and our ten largest clients accounted for\n63%, 66% and 62% respectively, of our total revenues. Our license agreements with large financial institutions are generally multi-year contracts\nthat may be terminated upon the expiration of the contract term or prior to such time for cause, which may include breach of contract,\nbankruptcy, insolvency and other reasons. Our license agreement with Fidelity does not have a specified term, but the license fee payments made\nto us by Fidelity under the license agreement cease on December 31, 2011. At such time, we will still receive ongoing platform services fees\nthrough the Fidelity relationship based upon usage, which include fees for ongoing technology services and software updates. A majority of our\nagreements with financial advisors generally provide for termination at any time. If our\n\n \n\n22\n\n27",
    "Page_28": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\ncontractual relationship with Fidelity were to terminate, or if a significant number of our most important clients were to terminate their contracts\nwith us and we were unable to obtain a significant number of new clients, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\n\nOur clients that pay us an asset-based fee may seek to negotiate a lower fee percentage or may cease using our services, which could\nlimit the growth of, or decrease, our revenues.\n\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from asset-based fees. Our clients may, for a number of reasons, seek to negotiate a lower\nasset-based fee percentage. For example, an increase in the use of index-linked investment products by the clients of our financial advisor clients\nmay result in lower fees being paid to our clients, and our clients may in turn seek to negotiate lower asset-based fee percentages for our\nservices. In addition, as competition among our clients increases, they may be required to lower the fees they charge to their clients, which could\ncause them to seek to decrease our fees accordingly. Any of these factors could result in fluctuation or a decline in our asset-based fees, which\nwould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\n \n\nChanges in market and economic conditions could lower the value of assets on which we earn revenues and could decrease the demand\nfor our investment solutions and services.\n\nAsset-based fees make up a significant portion of our revenues and several of our largest clients pay us on this basis. Asset-based fees\nrepresented 78%, 73% and 77% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. In addition, as a\nresult of the current trend of increased use of financial advisors by individual investors, we expect that asset-based fees will account for an\nincreasing percentage of our total revenues in the future. Significant fluctuations in securities prices may materially affect the value of the assets\nmanaged by our clients and may also influence financial advisor and investor decisions regarding whether to invest in, or maintain an investment\nin, a mutual fund or other investment solution. If such market fluctuation led to less investment in the securities markets, our revenues and\nearnings derived from asset-based fees could be materially adversely affected.\n\n \n\n  \n\nWe provide our investment solutions and services to the financial services industry. The financial markets, and in turn the financial services\nindustry, are affected by many factors, such as U.S. and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance that are beyond\nour control. In the event that the U.S. or international financial markets suffer a severe or prolonged downturn, investors may choose to\nwithdraw assets from financial advisors and transfer them to investments that are perceived to be more secure, such as bank deposits and\nTreasury securities. For example, in late 2007 and through the first quarter of 2009, the financial markets experienced a broad and prolonged\ndownturn, our redemption rates were higher than our historical average, and our results of operations, financial condition and business were\nmaterially adversely affected. Any prolonged downturn in financial markets, or increased levels of asset withdrawals could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\nInvestors decisions regarding their investment assets are affected by many factors and investors may redeem or withdraw their\ninvestment assets generally at any time. Significant changes in investing patterns or large-scale withdrawal of investment funds could\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\nThe clients of our financial advisors are generally free to change financial advisors, forgo the advice and other services provided by financial\nadvisors or withdraw the funds they have invested with financial advisors. These clients of financial advisors may elect to change their\ninvestment strategies, including by moving their assets away from equity securities to fixed income or other investment options, or by\nwithdrawing all or a portion of their assets from their accounts to avoid all securities markets-related risks. These actions by investors are outside\nof our control and could materially adversely affect the market value of the investment assets that our clients manage, which could materially\nadversely affect the asset-based fees we receive from our clients.\n\n23\n\n28",

Because we provide investment advisory services, both directly and\nindirectly, with respect to substantial assets we could face substantial liability to our clients if it is determined that we have breached our\nfiduciary duties. In certain circumstances, which generally depend on the types of investment solutions and services we are providing, we may\nenter into client agreements jointly with advisors and retain third-party investment money managers on behalf of clients. As a result, we may be\nincluded as a defendant in lawsuits against financial advisors and third-party investment money managers that involve claims of breaches of the\nduties of such persons, and we may face liabilities for the improper actions and/or omissions of such advisors and third-party investment money\nmanagers. In addition, we may face claims based on the results of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of a breach of\nour fiduciary duty. Such claims and liabilities could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or\nbusiness.\n\n \n\nWe are subject to liability for losses that result from potential, perceived or actual conflicts of interest.\n\nPotential, perceived and actual conflicts of interest are inherent in our existing and future business activities and could give rise to client\ndissatisfaction, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In particular, we pay varying fees to third-party asset managers and custodians and\nour financial advisor customers, or their clients, could accuse us of directing them toward those asset managers or custodians that charge us the\nlowest fees. In addition, we offer proprietary mutual funds and portfolios of mutual funds through our internal investment management and\nportfolio consulting group, and financial advisors or their clients could conclude that we favor our proprietary investment products because of\ntheir belief that we earn higher fees when our proprietary investment products are used. Adequately addressing conflicts of interest is complex\nand difficult and if we fail, or appear to fail, to adequately address potential, perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the resulting negative\npublic perception and reputational harm could materially adversely affect our client relations or ability to enter into contracts with new clients\nand, consequently, our results of operations, financial condition and business.\n\nIf our reputation is harmed, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur reputation, which depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our clients, is critical to our business. Our reputation is\nvulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries or\ninvestigations, lawsuits initiated by our clients, employee misconduct, perceptions of conflicts of interest and rumors, among other\ndevelopments, could substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. In addition, any perception that\nthe quality of our investment solutions and services may not be the same or better than that of other providers, can also damage our reputation.\nAny damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain clients, which would materially adversely affect our results of\noperations, financial condition and business.\n\nIf our investment solutions and services fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems, our results of operations,\nfinancial condition and business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nInvestment solutions and services we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing.

Errors may occur that could have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations, financial condition or business and could result in harm to our reputation, lost sales, delays in commercial\nrelease, third-party claims, contractual disputes, contract terminations or renegotiations, or unexpected expenses and diversion of management\nand other resources to remedy errors. In addition, negative public perception and reputational damage caused by such claims would adversely\naffect our client relationships and our ability to enter into new contracts. Any of these problems could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, financial condition and business.\n\nWe could face liability or incur costs to remediate operational errors or to address possible customer dissatisfaction.\n\nOperational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized\nexecution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our operating systems, business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal\ncontrol processes. We operate in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process large volumes of\ntransactions often within short time frames.

In such circumstances, we may elect to make payments or otherwise incur increased costs or lower revenues in order to\nmaintain a strong customer relationship. In any of the forgoing circumstances, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\n\nWe may become subject to liability based on the use of our investment solutions and services by our clients.\n\nOur investment solutions and services support the investment processes of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage billions of dollars of\nassets. Our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties\nbased on the use of our investment solutions and services. However, these provisions have certain exceptions and could be invalidated by\nunfavorable judicial decisions or by federal, state, foreign or local laws. Use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk\nthat clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts. Any such\nclaim, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel,\nfinancial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. Such claims and lawsuits could therefore have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, our clients may use our investment solutions and services together with software, data or products from other companies.

Consequently, we may be obligated to comply with the privacy and data security laws of such foreign countries. Our exposure to foreign\ncountries privacy and data security laws impacts our ability to collect and use personal information, increases our legal compliance costs and\nmay expose us to liability.\n\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation,\nindustry standards or contractual obligations. Increased domestic or international regulation of data utilization and distribution practices could\nrequire us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, financial condition or business.\n\nWe could face liability for certain information we provide, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.\n\nWe may be subject to claims for securities law violations, negligence, breach of fiduciary duties or other claims relating to the information we\nprovide. For example, individuals may take legal action against us if they rely on information we have provided and it contains an error. In\naddition, we could be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.

If Rule 3a-4 were to cease to be available, or if\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission were to modify the rule or its interpretation of how the rule is applied, our business could be adversely\naffected. Certain of our registered investment adviser subsidiaries provide advice to mutual fund clients. Mutual funds are registered as\ninvestment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of\n1940, together with related regulations and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, impose numerous obligations and\nrestrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including requirements relating to the safekeeping of client funds and securities,\nlimitations on advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities, restrictions on transactions between an\nadviser and its clients, and between a mutual fund and its advisers and affiliates, and other detailed operating requirements, as well as general\nfiduciary obligations.\n\nIn addition, PBS, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with all 50\nstates and the District of Columbia, and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a securities industry self-regulatory\norganization that supervises and regulates the conduct and activities of its members. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all\naspects of their business, including sales practices, market making and trading among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customer funds and\nsecurities, capital structure, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers, employees, representatives and associated persons. The\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority conducts periodic examinations of the operations of its members, including Portfolio Brokerage\nServices, Inc.

Some of our customer\nagreements restrict our ability to license or develop certain customized technology or services within certain markets or to certain competitors of\nour customers. For example, our agreement with Fidelity restricts our ability to develop an enterprise-level integration or combination of\nproducts and services substantially similar to the technology platform we have developed for Fidelity. Some of our customer agreements grant\nour customers ownership rights with respect to the portion of the intellectual property we have developed or customized for our customers. In\naddition, some of our customer agreements require us to deposit the source code to the customized technology and investment solutions with a\nsource code escrow agent, which source code may be released in the event we enter into bankruptcy or are unable to provide support and\nmaintenance of the technology or investment solutions we have licensed to our customers. These provisions in our agreements may limit our\nability to grow our business in the future.\n\n29\n\n34",

In addition, we license content, software and other intellectual property rights from third parties and may be\nsubject to claims of infringement if such parties do not possess the necessary intellectual property rights to the products they license to us. The\nrisk of infringement claims against us will increase if more of our competitors are able to obtain patents for investment solutions or services or\nbusiness processes. In addition, we face additional risk of infringement or misappropriation claims if we hire an employee who possesses third\nparty proprietary information who decides to use such information in connection with our investment solutions, services or business processes\nwithout such third party s authorization. We have in the past been and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims that we have\ninfringed or misappropriated the intellectual property rights of a third party. These claims sometimes involve patent holding companies who\nhave no relevant product revenues and against whom our own proprietary technology may therefore provide little or no deterrence. In addition,\nthird parties may in the future assert intellectual property infringement claims against our customers, which, in certain circumstances, we have\nagreed to indemnify. Any intellectual property related infringement or misappropriation claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly\nlitigation and could divert management resources and attention. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement or misappropriation, we\nmay be required to enter into licensing agreements, if available on acceptable terms or at all, pay substantial damages or make changes to the\ninvestment solutions and services that we offer. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from competing effectively, result in substantial costs to\nus, divert management s attention and our resources away from our operations and otherwise harm our reputation.\n\n   \n\n     \n   \n\nIf our intellectual property and proprietary technology are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our\ncompetitors, our business and competitive position would suffer.\n\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we have taken to\nprotect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary technology. There can be no\nassurance that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, investment solutions or services. Unauthorized copying or other\nmisappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our intellectual property rights without paying us for\ndoing so, which could harm our business. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive and our monitoring and\npolicing activities may not be sufficient to identify any misappropriation and protect our proprietary technology. In addition, third parties may\nknowingly or unknowingly infringe our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and litigation may be necessary to protect and enforce\nour intellectual property rights. If litigation is necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, any such litigation could be very\ncostly and could divert management attention and resources. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties\nindependently develop or gain access to our or similar technologies, investment solutions or services, our results of operations, financial\ncondition and business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe use of opensource code in investment solutions may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights.\n\nTo a limited extent, we rely on open source code to develop our investment solutions and support our internal systems and infrastructure. While\nwe monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our investment solutions to conditions we do not intend, such use could\ninadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source code into software we license\nfrom such third party for our investment solutions, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code for our\ninvestment solutions. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\ncondition and business.\n\n35",

These agreements\nmay not effectively prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or unauthorized parties from copying aspects of our\ntechnologies, investment solutions or products or obtaining and using information that we regard as proprietary. Moreover, these agreements\nmay not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized disclosures of confidential information and we cannot assure you that our\nrights under such agreements will be enforceable. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and\nin such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.

In addition, there are significant risks associated with\ngrowth through acquisitions, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\nWe expect to grow our business by, among other things, making acquisitions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks. They can be\ntime-consuming and may divert management s attention from day-to-day operations. Financing an acquisition could result in dilution from\nissuing equity securities or a weaker balance sheet from using cash or incurring debt. Acquisitions might also result in losing key employees. In\naddition, we may fail to successfully complete any acquisitions. We may also fail to generate enough revenues or profits from an acquisition to\n\nearn a return on the associated purchase price.\n\nTo the extent we grow our business through acquisitions, any such future acquisitions could present a number of other risks, including:\n\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies\nexpected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\nfailure to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and on a timely and cost\neffective basis;\n\ninsufficient knowledge of the operations and markets of acquired businesses;\n\nloss of key personnel;\n\ndiversion of management s attention from existing operations or other priorities;\n\nincreased costs or liabilities as a result of undetected or undisclosed legal, regulatory or financial issues related to acquired\noperations or assets; and\n\ninability to secure, on terms we find acceptable, sufficient financing that may be required for any such acquisition or investment.\nIn addition, if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses, operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do\nnot arise, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n   \n\nOur failure to successfully execute the conversion of our clients assets from their technology platform to our platform in a timely and\naccurate manner could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\nWhen we begin working with a new client, or acquire new client assets through an acquisition or other transaction, such as our agreement with\nFundQuest Incorporated, we are required to convert the new assets from\n\n36",

If we fail to successfully complete our conversions\nin a timely and accurate manner, we may be required to expend more time and resources than anticipated, which could erode the profitability of\nthe client relationship. In addition, any such failure may harm our reputation and may make it less likely that prospective clients will commit to\nworking with us. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business.\n\n \n\nOur business will suffer if we do not keep up with rapid technological change, evolving industry standards or changing requirements of\nclients.\n\nWe expect technological developments to continue at a rapid pace in our industry.

Changing client demands, new market practices or new technologies can render\nexisting investment solutions and services obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to\ndevelop new investment solutions and services and investment solution and service enhancements that address the future needs of our target\nmarkets and respond to technological and market changes. We incurred technology development expenditures of $4.9 million, $4.9 million and\n$5.6 million in the years ended December, 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We expect that our technology development expenditures will\ncontinue at this level or they may increase in the future.

Further, we may not be successful in developing, introducing,\nmarketing and licensing our new investment solutions or services or investment solution or service enhancements on a timely and cost effective\nbasis, or at all, and our new investment solutions and services and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace\nor achieve market acceptance.

As a result, when acting together, this group has the ability to\nexercise significant influence over most matters requiring our stockholders approval, including the election and removal of directors and\nsignificant corporate transactions.

The individuals who constitute our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, and limited\nexperience complying with the increasingly complex and changing laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team and other\npersonnel have devoted and will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to new compliance initiatives and we may not\nsuccessfully or efficiently manage our transition into a public company. Rules and regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have\nincreased our legal and finance compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly.

In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur\nadditional expenses associated with our Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements. A number of those requirements have and\nwill continue to require us to carry out activities we have not done previously. For example, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002, for our annual report on Form 10-K for year ending December 31, 2011, we will need to document and test our internal control\nprocedures, and our management will need to assess and report on our internal control over financial reporting.

Legal Proceedings\n\nOn November 23, 2009, we sued Fetter Logic, Inc., or Fetter Logic, and David Fetter, its chief executive officer, in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois. Our complaint sought, among other things, unspecified damages for breaches of the investment\nagreement and operating agreement that we entered into with Fetter Logic, described below, and a declaratory judgment that we own certain\nrights in certain intellectual property. Fetter Logic asserted claims against us in a separate suit and in a counterclaim filed November 30, 2009,\nand subsequently moved to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, for breaches of the investment agreement and\noperating agreement, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, copyright infringement,\nmisappropriation of trade secrets, an accounting, unjust enrichment and a declaratory judgment that Fetter Logic owns all rights in the contested\nintellectual property. Fetter Logic sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Both\ncases arose out of (1) an investment agreement, pursuant to which we purchased shares in Fetter Logic for approximately $5.7 million, and\n\n(2) an operating agreement, under which the parties agreed to integrate their respective software applications and develop and sell joint product\nofferings. Fetter Logic alleged that we did not comply with the terms of the operating agreement to develop joint product offerings, but instead\nmisappropriated Fetter Logic s intellectual property to develop products for our own benefit.\n\n \n\nOn July 8, 2010, the parties to the aforementioned litigation agreed to dismiss their respective lawsuits. In connection with this settlement, none\nof the parties are required to make any payments to any other party, we have relinquished our ownership interest in Fetter Logic, as well as\noperating receivables for services we provided during the term of the operating agreement and our rights under a promissory note issued to us in\nDecember 2009 in connection with our redemption of a portion of our ownership interest in Fetter Logic. In addition, we have the right to use\nany intellectual property developed or obtained by us in connection with the aforementioned operating agreement.\n\nWe are also involved in other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\n\nWe are a leading independent provider of wealth management solutions to financial advisors and institutions. Through our wealth management\nofferings, including Envestnet Advisor Suite and Envestnet PMC, our asset management arm, we deliver a Web-based gateway to expert,\nobjective, integrated wealth management solutions. By integrating a wide range of investment solutions and services, our technology platform\nprovides financial advisors with the flexibility to address their clients needs. We work with financial advisors who are independent, as well as\nthose who are associated with small or mid-sized financial advisory firms and larger financial institutions, which we refer to as enterprise clients.\nWe focus our technology development efforts and our sales and marketing approach on addressing financial advisors front-, middle- and\nback-office needs. We believe our investment solutions and services allow financial advisors to be more efficient and effective in the activities\ncritical to their businesses by facilitating client interactions, supporting and enhancing portfolio management and analysis, and enabling reliable\naccount support and administration. In addition, we are not controlled by a financial institution, broker-dealer or other entity operating in the\nsecurities or wealth management industry, which we believe affords us a greater level of independence and impartiality.\n\nOur centrally-hosted technology platform provides financial advisors with the flexibility to choose freely among a wide range of investment\nsolutions, services, investment managers and custodians to identify those that are most appropriate for their clients. Given the flexibility of\n\nchoice it provides, we refer to our technology platform as having open architecture . In addition, our technology platform allows us to add new or\nupgrade existing features and functionality as the industry and financial advisors needs evolve. Our technology platform provides financial\nadvisors with the following:\n\nA series of integrated services to help them better serve their clients, including risk assessment and selection of investment\nstrategies, asset allocation models, research and due diligence, portfolio construction, proposal generation and paperwork\npreparation, model management and account rebalancing, account monitoring, customized fee billing, overlay services covering\nasset allocation, tax management and socially responsible investing, aggregated multi-custodian performance reporting and\ncommunication tools, as well as access to a wide range of leading third-party asset custodians;\n\nWeb-based access to a wide range of technology-enabled investment solutions, including:\n\nseparately managed accounts, or SMAs, which allow advisors to offer their investor clients a customized, professionally\nmanaged portfolio of securities with a personalized tax basis;\n\n \n\nunified managed accounts, or UMAs, which are similar to SMAs but allow the advisor to use different types of\ninvestment vehicles in one account;\n\n47",

PMC s investment solutions and products include managed account and\nmulti-manager portfolios, mutual fund portfolios and ETF portfolios.\n\nRevenues\nOverview\n\nWe earn revenues primarily under two pricing models. First, a majority of our revenues are derived from fees charged as a percentage of the\nassets that are managed or administered on our technology platform by financial advisors. These revenues are recorded under revenues from\nassets under management or administration. Our asset-based fees vary based on the types of investment solutions and services that financial\nadvisors utilize. Asset-based fees accounted for approximately 78%, 73% and 77% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008,\n2009 and 2010, respectively. The percentage of our total revenues represented by asset-based fees declined in the year ended December 31, 2009\nprincipally due to the significant decline in the market value of the assets on our technology platform resulting from fluctuations in the securities\nmarkets, particularly from September 2007 to March 2009, and also due to our entering into a significant license agreement in 2008. U.S.-based\nequities appreciated significantly during the remainder of 2009 and throughout 2010 and contributed to an increase in our assets under\nmanagement or administration, and our resulting revenues from asset-based fees. In future periods, the percentage of our total revenues\nattributable to asset-based fees is expected to vary based on fluctuations in securities markets, whether we enter into significant license\nagreements, the mix of assets under management, or AUM, and assets under administration, or AUA, and other factors. As of December 31,\n2010, approximately $64 billion of investment assets subject to asset-based fees were managed or administered utilizing our technology platform\nby approximately 13,800 financial advisors in approximately 307,000 investor accounts.\n\n \n\nSecond, we generate revenues from recurring, contractual licensing fees for providing access to our technology platform, generally from a small\nnumber of enterprise clients. These revenues are recorded under revenues from licensing and professional services. Licensing fees are generally\nfixed in nature for the contract term and are based on the level of investment solutions and services provided, rather than on the amount of client\nassets on our technology platform. Licensing fees accounted for 19%, 24% and 20% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31,\n2008, 2009 and 2010. Fees received in connection with professional services accounted for the remainder of our total revenues. As of\nDecember 31, 2010, approximately $76 billion of investment assets for which we receive licensing fees for utilizing our technology platform\nwere serviced by approximately 7,700 financial advisors through approximately 604,000 investor accounts.\n\n40\n\n49",

The level\nof fees varies based on the nature of the investment solutions and services we provide, as well as the specific investment manager, fund and/or\ncustodian chosen by the financial advisor. A portion of our revenues from assets under management or administration include costs paid by us to\nthird parties for sub-advisory, clearing, custody and brokerage services. These expenses are recorded under cost of revenues. We do not have\nfiduciary responsibility in connection with AUA and, therefore, charge lower fees on these assets. Our fees for AUA vary based on the nature of\nthe investment solutions and services we provide.\n\nFor over 85% of our revenues from assets under management or administration, we bill customers at the beginning of each quarter based on the\nmarket value of customer assets on our technology platform as of the end of the prior quarter. For example, revenues from assets under\nmanagement or administration recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 were based on the market value of assets as of September 30, 2010.\nOur revenues from assets under management or administration are generally recognized ratably throughout the quarter based on the number of\ndays in the quarter.\n\nAs noted above, the most significant factor affecting our revenues from assets under management or administration is changes in the market\nvalues of securities held in client accounts due to fluctuations in the securities markets. Certain types of securities have historically experienced\ngreater market price fluctuations, such as equity securities, than other securities, such as fixed income securities, though in any given period the\nnature of securities that experience the greatest fluctuations may vary. For example, from October 2007 to March 2009, the equity markets, as\nmeasured by the value of the S&P 500 index, declined in value by approximately 57%, which significantly contributed to the 37% decrease in\nour revenues from assets under management or administration between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009.\n\n \n\nOur revenues from assets under management or administration are also affected by the amount of new assets that are added to existing and new\nclient accounts, which we refer to as gross sales, and the amount of\n\n50",

Therefore, we do not have direct control over the mix of\nAUM and AUA.\n\nRevenues from licensing and professional services fees\n\nOur revenues received under license agreements are recognized over the contractual term. To a lesser degree we also receive revenues from\nprofessional services fees by providing customers with certain technology platform software development services. In the years ended\nDecember 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, our revenues from professional services fees were $2.4 million, $2.4 million and $2.9 million respectively.\nThese revenues are generally recognized under a proportional performance model utilizing an output based approach. Our contracts have fixed\nprices, and generally specify or quantify interim deliverables.\n\n52",

The largest component of cost of revenues, sub-advisory fees paid to third- party investment managers, relates only to AUM since a\nsub-advisor is not utilized in connection with AUA.\n\nClearing, custody and brokerage services are provided by third-party providers. All of these expenses are typically calculated based upon a\ncontractual percentage of the market value of assets held in customer accounts measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter and are recognized\nratably throughout the quarter based on the number of days in the quarter.\n\nCompensation and benefits\n\nCompensation and benefits expenses primarily relate to employee compensation, including salaries, commissions, non-cash stock-based\ncompensation, profit sharing, benefits and employer-related taxes.\n\nGeneral and administration\n\nGeneral and administration expenses include occupancy costs and expenses relating to communications services, research and data services,\nwebsite and system development, marketing, professional and legal services and travel and entertainment.\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation related to:\n\nfixed assets, including computer equipment and software, leasehold improvements, office furniture and fixtures and other office\nequipment;\n\ninternally developed software; and\n\nintangible assets, primarily related to customer lists, the value of which was capitalized in connection with our prior acquisitions.\nFurniture and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Leasehold\nimprovements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term, whichever is\nshorter. Improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are recorded as expenses in the period they are incurred. Assets are\ntested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.\n\nInternally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these ass\nan annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\n\n \n\nIntangible assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives and are reviewed for possible\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\n\n43\n\n54",
    "Page_55": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\n2010 Developments\nFundQuest Agreement\n\nIn February 2010, we signed a seven-year platform services agreement with FundQuest. Pursuant to this agreement, we provide FundQuest and\nits clients our platform technology and support services, replacing FundQuest s technology platform. FundQuest will continue to provide\ninvestment products to its clients.\n\nIn order to support the increase in assets under administration resulting from this agreement, we hired 20 staff from FundQuest to assist us with\nthe ongoing administration of existing and new FundQuest customers. As a result, we expect total compensation and benefits expense, as a\npercentage of total revenues, to increase by approximately one percentage point.\n\nIn connection with this agreement, we have agreed to make various payments to FundQuest during the contract term. These payments include an\nup-front payment upon completion of the conversion of FundQuest s clients assets to our technology platform, five annual payments and a\npayment after the fifth year of the agreement calculated based on the revenues we receive from the FundQuest assets during the first five years\nof the contract term. As of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010, our estimate of the present value of these payments was approximately $28.7\nmillion and $30.4 million, respectively. The increase in the present value of these payments is a result of an increase in the estimated revenue we\nexpect to receive from the FundQuest assets during the first five years of the contract term.\n\nIn addition, we also issued FundQuest a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock, with an exercise price to be calculated as 120% of our\ninitial public offering price per share of our common stock with an estimated fair value of $2.9 million. As of the closing of our initial public\noffering, the number of shares of common stock issuable to FundQuest under the warrant was 1,388,888 shares at an exercise price of $10.80 per\nshare. The present value of all payments and the fair value of the warrant is being accounted for as customer inducement costs and is being\namortized as a reduction to our revenues from assets under management or administration on a straight-line basis over the contract term.\n\nWe anticipate that our annual net revenues will increase in proportion to the increase in assets under administration resulting from the\nagreement. The revenue we recognize under this agreement will be net of customer inducement amortization of approximately $4.8 million per\nyear. Additionally, we expect to recognize approximately $0.8 million of interest expense annually during the first five years of the contract\nterm. Revenues, customer inducement costs and interest expense may change over the contractual term based upon changes in the market value\nof customer assets and in the net flows relating to new and existing customer accounts.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2010, the company recognized customer inducement amortization of approximately $3.2 million and imputed\ninterest expense of $0.5 million related to this agreement.\n\nAs a result of the reduction in our revenues due to the amortization of customer inducement costs, cash flows received under this agreement will\nexceed the recorded value of the revenues we recognize relating to the agreement for any given period during the term of the agreement.\n\nClosure of Los Angeles Office\n\nIn January 2010, we announced that we would be closing our Los Angeles, CA office, effective March 31, 2010, in order to more appropriately\nalign and manage our internal resources. The Los Angeles office was the headquarters of NetAssetManagement, Inc., or NAM, which we\nacquired in 2004. The office had three primary functional groups: our investment consulting group, Portfolio Management Consultants;\noperational processing; and technology operations support. In connection with the closing of the Los Angeles office, its investment consulting\ngroup functions were transferred to our Chicago headquarters, its operational processing functions were transferred to our Denver operations\ncenter and its technical operations support functions were transferred to our Sunnyvale office.\n\n55",

The closure of this\noffice and related actions are expected to result in decreased costs in future periods.\n\nFactors Affecting Comparability\n\nWe expect our stock-based compensation expense to increase in future periods as a result of our award of approximately 1,834,000 stock options\nto our employees upon the closing of our initial public offering in July of 2010. In addition, we expect our compensation and benefits and\ngeneral and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as a result of becoming an SEC-reporting company subject to the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and the other regulatory requirements applicable to public companies. Accordingly, our results of operations for future\nperiods may not be comparable to our results of operations for the periods under review.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S.\nGAAP. The accounting policies described below require management to apply significant judgment in connection with the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements. In particular, judgment is applied to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in calculating estimates\nthat affect certain reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience\nand on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. If different estimates or assumptions were used, our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows could have been materially different than those reflected in our consolidated financial\nstatements. For additional information regarding our critical accounting policies, see note 2 to the notes to the audited consolidated financial\nstatements.\n\nRevenue recognition\n\nWe recognize revenues when all four of the following criteria have been met:\n\nPersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;\n\nThe product has been delivered or the service has been performed;\n\nThe fee is fixed or determinable; and\n\nCollectability is reasonably assured.\nTypes of revenues\n\nWe generate revenues from assets under management or administration and from licensing and professional service fees. Revenues from assets\nunder management or administration are generated from fees based on a contractual percentage of assets under management or administration\nvalued at each quarter-end. These fees are generally collected at the beginning of a quarter in advance based upon the previous quarter-end\nvalues. In less than 15% of our contracts, fees are collected at the end of the quarter based upon the current quarter-end value. The contractual\nfee percentages vary based upon the level and type of services we provide to our customers. Pursuant to the contracts with our customers, we\ncalculate our fees based on the asset values in the customer s account, without making any judgment or estimates. None of our fees are earned\npursuant to performance-based or other incentive-based arrangements.\n\n \n\nWe generate revenues from licensing fees pursuant to recurring contractual fixed-fee agreements, principally with a portion of our enterprise\nclients. Our licensing fees vary based on the type of services we provide. We generate revenues from professional service fees by providing\ncustomers with customized technology platform software development services. These revenues are received pursuant to contracts that detail the\nnature of the services to be provided by us, the estimated number of hours such work will require and the total contract fee amount.\n\n56",

    "Page_58": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nRecognition of revenues\n\nApplication of the applicable accounting principles of U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments and estimates in connection with the\nmeasurement and recognition of revenues. Revenues are recognized in the period in which the related services are provided. In certain cases,\nmanagement is required to determine whether revenues should be recognized in an amount equal to the gross fees we receive or as a net amount\nreflecting the payment of expenses to third-parties, such as sub-advisors and custodians, that provide services to us in connection with certain of\nour financial advisors client accounts. When fees are collected for sub-advisory, clearing, custody or brokerage services in circumstances where\nwe do not have a direct contract with the third-party provider, the fees are recorded as revenue on a net basis. Fees we received in advance of the\nperformance of services are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets and are recognized as revenues when earned,\ngenerally over three months.\n\n \n\nRevenues from licensing are recognized over the contractual term. Contracts with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract\ninterpretation to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy to apply.\n\nRevenues from professional services are recognized under a proportional performance model utilizing an output based approach. Our contracts\nhave fixed prices, and generally specify or quantify interim deliverables.\n\nOur revenue recognition is also affected by our judgment in determining appropriate allowances for uncollectible receivables. We consider\ncustomer-specific information related to delinquent accounts and past lost experience, as well as current economic conditions in establishing the\namount of the allowance.\n\nCustomer inducements\n\nIn certain instances, we enter into platform service agreements which include inducement payments to the customer. In accordance with U.S.\nGAAP, inducement payments made to customers are capitalized and amortized against revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the\nagreement. Customer inducement assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances occur that may impact the fair value of\nthese assets.\n\n \n\nInternally developed software\n\nCosts relating to internally developed software that are incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Management\ndetermines when projects have met the criteria of the application development stage. This typically occurs when the conceptual formulation and\nevaluation of software functionality are finalized.\n\nOnce work on a software application has passed the preliminary stages, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until\nthe software application is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. These costs include expenditures related to software design,\ntechnical specifications, coding, installation of hardware and parallel testing. We cease capitalizing these costs upon completion of all substantial\ntesting of the software application.\n\n       \n\nWe also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements of our internally developed software when we conclude that it is\nprobable that the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Our maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nAs of December 31, 2009 and 2010, we had net capitalized internally developed software of $3.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. We\ncapitalized $1.7, million, $1.3 million and $1.3 million in internally developed software during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and\n2010, respectively.\n\nInternally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.

We expect that this will continue to be the case in the future. Our board of directors is\nresponsible for determining the timing and magnitude of all option grants. Prior to our initial public offering on July 28, 2010, our board of\ndirectors, were responsible for determining the fair value of our common stock on the date of each stock option grant.

As\nrequired under our 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and our 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan, all of our options are granted with exercise prices at or\nabove the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.\n\nThe following table provides information regarding options granted since January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010:\n\nIntrinsic Value\n\nDate Shares Stock Price Exercise Price As of December 31, 2010\n2/16/2009\n1,000 $ 7.85 $ 7.85 $ 9.24\n4/8/2009 8,230 7.85 7.85 9.24\n5/15/2009 232,732 TAS TAS 9.94\n7/6/2009 10,000 TAS TAS 9.94\n11/16/2009 12,000 11.50 11.50 5.59\n2/22/2010 71,000 13.45 13.45 3.64\n7/28/2010 1,885,390 9.00 9.00 8.09\n9/1/2010 2,000 10.25 10.25 6.84\n9/30/2010 33,600 10.46 10.46 6.63\n\nAs a private company, there was no market for our common stock and therefore no readily available price to reference when determining the fair\nvalue of our common stock in connection with the granting of stock options. The value of our common stock was dependent upon our company\nvaluation and, as described below, we had periodically obtained independent valuations and performed internal valuations of our common stock.\nIn each case, such valuations had been performed contemporaneously and we had determined the fair market value of our company in\nconformity with commonly accepted corporate valuation techniques and methodologies.\n\nPrior to our initial public offering, we generally had obtained contemporaneous independent valuations at least annually and at the time of\nbroad-based option grants, such as on May 15, 2009 and February 22, 2010. For our internal valuations, we applied the same approach and\nmethodology used by the independent valuation firm. For any option grants made between quarterly valuations of our common stock, our board\nof directors assessed all available information in determining whether the stock price in effect at the time of the grant should otherwise be\nadjusted. As a private company, we had performed our quarterly valuations such that they were effective approximately 45 days following the\nend of each calendar quarter to approximate the date upon which, if we were a reporting company, we would be required to disclose to the\npublic through filings with the Commission our financial performance and associated operating metrics, which include assets under management\nand administration. Until such date, any information about a given quarter s financial performance, ending asset values, and other information\nthat could be deemed material to investors, would not be known to the public even if we were a reporting company and therefore is not included\nin the valuation of our common stock during interim periods.\n\nIn the specific cases of option grants made after the dates of our quarterly valuations during the period under review, our board of directors\nconcluded that no adjustment should have been made to the most recent valuation of our common stock based on its assessment that, had we\nbeen a reporting company, no new material information would have been available to the public since the date of the prior valuation of our\ncommon stock.\n\n47\n\n59",
    "Page_60": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nAs a private company, our company valuation, whether prepared by an independent valuation firm or performed internally, considered an\nincome approach, also known as a discounted cash flow analysis, incorporating our historical and expected financial performance, the relevant\nmarket and industry and economic trends. Our valuation also considered a market approach, including recent capital transactions involving\neither our company or comparable companies, and comparable public-company valuations. The resulting calculation assigned a value for 100%\nof our company s equity on a marketable equivalent, non-controlling interest basis. We considered, but did not include, an asset approach, as we\ndid not believe the book value of our assets provides meaningful input into our expected revenue and earnings, or the value of our company.\n\n  \n\n \n\nWe believe the value of our common stock had the potential to change each fiscal quarter in the normal course of our business, since the\nmajority of our total revenues earned in a given quarter are calculated based on the value of AUM and AUA as of the end of the previous fiscal\nquarter. These revenues, and our historical resulting projections for earnings and cash flow, were inherently subject to fluctuations from quarter\nto quarter.\n\nAccordingly, as a private company, we calculated the value of our common stock at least once each fiscal quarter. The historical quarterly\nvaluations did at times fluctuate significantly as the market value of our assets under management or administration drives our near term\nfinancial results and longer term projections. The value of our common stock could also change if a material financing transaction or other\nsignificant event occurs within a given fiscal quarter. In such circumstances we performed an additional valuation of our common stock at the\ntime of the transaction or event, using the same valuation methodology that is utilized in connection with our quarterly valuations.\n\n \n\nAfter we determined a value for our company, we allocated the value to each class of our shares, including our common stock. Our value\nallocation methodology applies the principles set forth in the AICPA Practice Aid Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued\nas Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The Practice Aid defines appropriate methods to allocate enterprise value to common shares when\n\nmultiple share classes exist. Based on various factors, including the stage of acompany s life and the timing and likelihood of various liquidity\nevents, one method of allocation may be more appropriate than the others. We considered, but did not use, the probability-weighted expected\nreturn method due to the number of assumptions for each scenario that are difficult to estimate, and the fact that our most likely liquidation event\nwas an initial public offering. Additionally, we did not apply the liquidation method because, as the Practice Aid indicates, it would be\ninappropriate for a later-stage company such as ours to use that method to allocate value to the various share classes. Furthermore, the more\nimminent a liquidity event becomes, the more aligned the liquidation model and option pricing model become in attributing value to each share\nclass. Accordingly, we used the option pricing method, as defined in the Practice Aid, which treats each class of equity as having a_ call option on\nthe enterprise value. The option pricing method considers the economic preferences and other rights attributable to each share class, resulting in\n\na price for each of our share classes, including our common stock. Our valuations of our common stock also reflected a discount for lack of\nmarketability, adjusted over time to reflect the expected likelihood and timing of a liquidity event subsequent to each valuation date. No other\ndiscounts were applied in determining the value of our common stock.\n\n \n\n \n\nDuring 2009 and through the date our initial public offering on July 28, 2010, we performed the following contemporaneous valuations of our\ncommon stock:\n\nFair Value of\n\nDate Common Stock\n2/15/2009 $ 7.85\n5/15/2009 715\n8/15/2009 9.90\n11/15/2009 11.50\n2/15/2010 13.45\n\nAs described above, the assets under management or administration on our technology platform at the end of a given quarter have a significant\nimpact on our short- and long-term financial projections and resulting\n\n48\n\n60",
    "Page_61": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nvaluation. For example, the valuation conducted on May 15, 2009 incorporated financial projections based on assets under management or\nadministration as of March 31, 2009. The value of those assets was 6% below the value of the assets as of December 31, 2008. This contributed\nto the decline in the estimated fair value of our common stock between periods. Conversely, assets under management or administration\nincreased 16% between March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, contributing to an increase in the estimated fair value of our common stock between\nMay 15, 2009 and August 15, 2009. In addition, assets under management or administration increased 15% between June 30, 2009 and\nSeptember 30, 2009, which contributed to the increase in the fair value of our common stock between August 15, 2009 and November 15, 2009.\nA 4% increase in assets under management or administration between September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, as well as our new\nagreement with FundQuest (see 2010 Developments _), contributed to the increase in the fair value of our common stock between November 15,\n2009 and February 15, 2010. The decrease between the fair value of our common stock on November 15, 2009 and February 15, 2010 and the\ninitial public offering price was principally attributable to volatility in the trading prices of the common stock of comparable companies and the\ndifficult conditions in the market for initial public offerings at and immediately prior to our determination of the initial public offering price for\nthis offering. Other factors, such as updated financial projections not related to changes in our assets under management or administration, as\nwell as fluctuations in the value of comparable publicly-traded companies, also contributed to the differences in the estimated fair value of our\ncommon stock between periods.\n\nSince our initial public offering on July 28, 2010, we have not performed internal valuations or obtained independent valuations in order to\ndetermine the Company s stock price to reference when determining the fair value of our common stock in connection with the granting of stock\noptions.\n\nNon-cash stock-based compensation expense for stock option grants is estimated at the grant date based on each grant s fair value, calculated\nusing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation and benefits expenses are recognized over the vesting period for each grant. The\nfair value of our stock options and the resulting expenses are based on various assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock price,\nthe expected term of the stock options, estimated forfeiture rates and the risk-free interest rate. The use of different assumptions would result in\ndifferent fair values and compensation and benefits expenses for our option grants.\n\n \n\nIncome taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and India. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining\nour provision for income taxes.\n\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective\ntax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to\ntaxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized under income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date. We record a valuation\nallowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that we determine is more-likely-than-not to be realized in the future.\n\nIn our ordinary course of business, we may enter into transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In such cases, we\nestablish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on our estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The\nreserves are established when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax\nauthorities. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of an estimate.\nAlthough we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from\nthat which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nthan the amounts recorded, such differences will be reflected in our provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes includes the\nimpact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.\n\n49\n\n61",
    "Page_62": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a\nvaluation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of\ntax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust\nour valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\n\n   \n\nOur effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates primarily due to adjustments in valuation allowances, state income taxes and changes in\nrates. Our provision for income taxes varies based on, among other things, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the\ntax effects of non-cash stock-based compensation or changes in applicable tax laws, regulations and accounting principles or interpretations\nthereof.\n\nAs of December 31, 2010, we had net operating loss carry-forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $36.0 million and $35.0\nmillion, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire\nthrough 2026.\n\nWe are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood\nof adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues\nfrom assets under management or administration of $19.1 million. Revenues from assets under management or administration comprised 73%\nand 77% of total revenue in 2009 and 2010, respectively.\n\nAssets under management or administration\n\nRevenues earned from assets under management or administration increased 34% from $56.9 million in 2009 to $76.0 million in 2010. This\nincrease was primarily due to an increase in asset values applicable to our quarterly billing cycles in 2010, relative to those used in 2009. Our\n2010 revenues were positively affected by new account growth and positive net flows of AUM and AUA during the fourth quarter of 2009\nthrough September 30, 2010, as well as an increase in market value of AUM and AUA from the fourth quarter of 2009 to September 30, 2010.\n\nNew account growth and positive net flows of AUM and AUA resulted from continued efforts to increase the number of financial advisors and\naccounts on our technology platform and the implementation of the FundQuest assets on our technology platform. The number of financial\nadvisors with AUM or AUA that had client accounts on our technology platform increased from 8,408 as of December 31, 2009 to 13,833 as of\nDecember 31, 2010 and the number of AUM or AUA client accounts increased from approximately 175,000 as of December 31, 2009 to\napproximately 307,000 as of December 31, 2010.\n\nLicensing and professional services\n\nLicensing and professional services revenues increased 5% from $21.1 million in 2009 to $22.1 million in 2010, primarily due to an increase in\nlicensing revenue of $0.6 million and an increase in professional services revenue of $0.5 million.\n\nCost of revenues\n\nCost of revenues increased 28% from $24.6 million in 2009 to $31.4 million in 2010, primarily due to an increase in revenues from assets under\nmanagement or administration. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues remained flat at 32% in both periods.\n\nCompensation and benefits\n\nCompensation and benefits increased 29% from $28.8 million in 2009 to $37.0 million in 2010, primarily due to an increase in salaries and\ncommissions of $5.3 million related to an increase in headcount, an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million\nprimarily due to the grant of stock options effective the date of our initial public offering, an increase in benefits and payroll taxes of $0.7\nmillion, an increase in profit sharing expense of $0.8 million and an increase in severance of $0.6 million. Headcount increased from an average\nof 408 in 2009 to an average of 437 in 2010 primarily due to the hiring of former FundQuest and B-Ready Outsourcing Solutions, Inc.\nemployees (see note 3 to the notes to the audited financial statements) in the second quarter of 2010.

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increases in\ncapitalized computer equipment and software to support the growth of our operations. As a percentage of total revenues, depreciation and\namortization remained flat at 6% in both periods.\n\nRestructuring charges\n\nEffective March 31, 2010, we closed our Los Angeles office in order to more appropriately align and manage our resources and incurred\nrestructuring charges of approximately $1.0 million in 2010.

In 2008,\nrevenues were relatively unaffected by the significant market decline that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008. Our fourth quarter 2008\nrevenues were driven primarily by the value of AUM and AUA as of September 30, 2008.

The first change relates to the determination of when\nindividual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. The second change modifies\nthe manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables. This guidance also significantly\nexpands the disclosures required for multiple-element revenue arrangements. The guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning on\nor after June 15, 2010, but early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible\nproducts and software elements so that tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to\ndeliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in Accounting Standards\nCodification ( ASC_) Subtopic 985-605. In addition, this guidance requires hardware components of a tangible product containing software\ncomponents always be excluded from the software revenue guidance.

Organization and Description of Business\n\nEnvestnet, Inc. ( Envestnet ) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company ) provides open-architecture wealth management services and\ntechnology to independent financial advisors and financial institutions. These services and related technology are provided via the Envestnet\nAdvisor Suite and Envestnet | PMC, the Company s asset management arm. The Company s headquarters are in Chicago. Principal offices are\nlocated in New York, New York; Denver, Colorado; Sunnyvale, California; Boston Massachusetts; Landis, North Carolina and two locations in\nTrivandrum, India.\n\nThe Company s Advisor Suite is a platform of integrated, internet-based technology applications and related services that provide portfolio\ndiagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, portfolio performance reporting and monitoring\nsolutions, billing, and back-office and middle-office operations and administration.\n\nThe Company s investment consulting group, Portfolio Management Consultants, provides investment manager due diligence and research, a full\nspectrum of investment offerings supported by both proprietary and third-party research, and overlay portfolio management services.\n\nThrough these platform and service offerings, the Company provides open-architecture support for a wide range of investment products\n(separately managed accounts, multi-manager accounts, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, stock baskets, alternative investments, and other\nfee-based investment solutions) from Portfolio Management Consultants and other leading investment providers via multiple custodians, and\nalso account administration and reporting services.\n\nEnvestnet operates three registered investment advisor firms ( RIAs_) and a registered broker-dealer. The RIAs are registered with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission ( SEC _). The broker-dealer is registered with the SEC, all 50 states and the District of Columbia and is a member of\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ).\n\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company follows accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB_) to ensure consistent reporting of\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows. References to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP._) in these footnotes are\nto the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™, sometimes referred to as the codification or ASC.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Envestnet and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Oberon\nFinancial Technology, Inc. ( Oberon ); NetAssetManagement, Inc. ( NAM _); Envestnet Asset Management, Inc.; Sigma Asset Management, LLC;\nPMC International, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Portfolio Management Consultants, Inc. and Portfolio Brokerage Services, Inc.\n\n( PBS _). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Accounts denominated in a non-U.S.\ncurrency have been re-measured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.\n\nManagement Estimates Management of the Company has made certain estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these audited consolidated financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP. Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to estimating uncollectible receivables, costs\ncapitalized for internally developed software, valuations and assumptions used for impairment testing of goodwill, intangible and other\nlong-lived assets, fair value of stock and stock options issued, fair value of customer inducement assets and liabilities, realization of deferred tax\nassets and valuation and other assumptions used to allocate purchase\n\n67\n\n87",

Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nRevenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from services related to asset management and administration, licensing and professional\nservices fees.\n\nAsset management and administration fees The Company derives revenues from fees charged as a percentage of the assets that are\nmanaged or administered on its technology platform by financial advisors, financial institutions, and their clients (collectively\ncustomers ) and for services the Company provides to its customers. Such services include investment manager due diligence and\nresearch, portfolio diagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, portfolio\nperformance reporting and monitoring solutions, billing, and back office and middle-office operations and administration.\nInvestment decisions for assets under management or administration are made by our customers. The asset management and\nadministration fees the Company earns are generally based upon a contractual percentage of assets managed or administered on\nour platform based on preceding quarter-end values. The contractual fee percentages vary based on the level and type of services\nthe Company provides to its customers. Fees related to assets under management or administration increase or decrease based on\nvalues of existing customer accounts. The values are affected by inflows or outflows of customer funds and market fluctuations.\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nLicensing and professional services fees The Company derives licensing fees from recurring contractual fixed fee contracts with\nlarger financial institutions or enterprise clients. Licensing contracts allow the customer to provide a unique configuration of\nplatform features and investment solutions for their advisers. The licensing fees vary based on the type of services provided and\nour revenues received under license agreements are recognized over the contractual term.\nThe Company s license agreements do not generally provide its customers the ability to take possession of its software or host the software on its\nown systems or through a hosting arrangement with an unrelated party. However, in a certain instance, a customer has the ability to take\npossession of the software, and accordingly, the Company considers this circumstance as a multiple-element arrangement. As a multiple element\narrangement, the Company is required to determine whether there is vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE_) of the various elements,\nincluding the software license and service components. The Company has not established VSOE of fair value for the separate components, and\naccordingly, recognizes revenue from these arrangements at such time as all elements of the arrangement have been delivered.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, the Company derives professional service fees from providing contractual customized service platform software development,\nwhich are recognized under a proportional performance model utilizing an output based approach. The Company s contracts have fixed prices,\nand generally specify or quantify interim deliverables.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company s revenues are based on contractual arrangements. Revenues are recognized in the periods in which the related\nservices are performed provided that persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably\nassured. Cash received by the Company in advance of the performance of services is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned. Certain\nportions of the Company s revenues require management s consideration of the nature of the client relationship in determining whether to\nrecognize as revenue the gross amount billed or net amount retained after payments are made to providers for certain services related to the\nproduct or service offering.\n\n68\n\n88",
    "Page_89": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nEnvestnet, Inc.\nNotes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n\nThe two main factors the Company uses to determine whether to record revenue on a gross or net basis is based on whether:\n\nthe Company has a direct contract with the third party provider; and\n\nthe Company has discretion in establishing fees paid by the customer and fees due to the third party service provider.\nWhen customer fees include charges for third party service providers where the Company has a direct contract with such third party service\nproviders gross revenue recognized by the Company equals the fee paid by customer. The cost of revenues recognized by the Company is the\namount due to the third party provider.\n\nIn instances where the Company does not have a direct contract with the third party service provider, the Company does not recognize any\nrevenue or expense. The fees that are collected from the customer by the Company and are remitted to the third party service provider are\nconsidered pass through amounts and accordingly are not a component of revenue or cost of revenues.\n\nCost of Revenues Cost of revenues primarily include expenses related to sub-advisory and clearing, custody and brokerage services. Generally,\nthese expenses are calculated based upon a contractual percentage of the market value of assets held in customer accounts measured as of the\nend of each quarter and are recognized ratably throughout the quarter based on the number of days in the quarter.\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible fee\nreceivables. In establishing the amount of the allowance, customer-specific information is considered related to delinquent accounts, including\npast lost experience and current economic conditions.\n\nSegments The Company s chief operating decision maker is its chief executive officer, who reviews financial information presented on a\nconsolidated basis. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments, net of any allowances, including cash equivalents, fees\nreceivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values due to their\nshort-term nature.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to\nbe cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company s financial instruments that are\nexposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash accounts at financial\ninstitutions in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Company monitors such credit risk and has\nnot experienced any losses related to such risk.\n\n \n\nInvestments Investments are recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment. Investments are included in Other non-current assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and consist of non-marketable investments in privately held companies as well as other alternative investments. The\nCompany reviews these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these investments. This policy\nincludes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the investee s cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational\nperformance, management/ownership changes and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that the Company requests from\nthese investees. This information is not subject to the same\n\n \n\n69\n\n89",
    "Page_90": "Edgar Filing: ENVESTNET, INC. - Form 10-K\n\n \n\nEnvestnet, Inc.\nNotes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n\ndisclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the\ndata received from these investees.\n\nThe Company s investments are assessed for impairment when a review of the investees operations indicates that there exists a decline in value\nof the investment and the decline is other than temporary. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources, limited\nprospects of receiving additional financing, and prospects for liquidity of the related securities. Impaired investments are written down to\nestimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies, including comparing the investee with\npublicly traded companies in similar lines of business, applying valuation multiples to estimated future operating results and estimated\ndiscounted future cash flows.\n\n  \n\nProperty and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of furniture and\nequipment is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Leasehold improvements are\namortized on the straight-line basis over their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Improvements\nare capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. Assets are tested for recoverability whenever events\n\nor circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n \n\nCustomer Inducements Payments made to customers as an inducement are capitalized and amortized against revenue on a straight-line basis over\nthe term of the agreement.\n\nInternally Developed Software Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has\nreached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete\nand ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. The Company also capitalizes costs related to\nspecific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Maintenance and training costs\nare expensed as incurred. Internally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Management evaluates\nthe useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact\nthe recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments of internally developed software during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009\nand 2010.\n\n \n\n \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses\nacquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment each year using a two-step process that is performed at least annually or whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The Company has concluded that it has a single reporting unit. The first step is a\ncomparison of the fair value of an internal reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary. If the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of\nthe goodwill to a determination of the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied value,\nan impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The implied value of the goodwill is determined as of the test date by performing a purchase\nprice allocation, as if the reporting unit had just been acquired, using currently estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the\nreporting unit, together with an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole. The estimate of the fair value of the reporting\nunit is based upon information available regarding prices of similar groups of assets, or other valuation techniques including present value\ntechniques based upon estimates of future cash flow.

Intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or\nchanged circumstances may affect the underlying basis of the net assets. Such reviews include an analysis of current results and take into\nconsideration the undiscounted value of projected operating cash flows.\n\nLong-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, capitalized internal use software and intangible assets subject to amortization\nare reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated\nundiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future\ncash flows, an impairment charged is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the\nasset group.\n\n  \n\nManagement evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\noccur that could impact recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments to long-lived assets during the years ended December 31,\n2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nLeases In certain circumstances, the Company enters into leases with free rent periods, rent escalations or lease incentives over the term of the\nlease. In such cases, we calculate the total payments over the term of the lease and record them ratably as rent expense over that term.\n\nIncome Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for\nthe future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and\n\ntheir respective tax bases and net operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected\nto apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax\nassets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a\nvaluation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not.\n\nThe Company follows authoritative guidance related to how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, disclosed and presented in\n\nthe audited consolidated financial statements. This requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of\n\npreparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained when challenged or when\nexamined by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or\nexpense and liability in the current year. The tax benefits recognized in the audited consolidated financial statements from tax positions are\n\nmeasured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n\nAdvertising Costs The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred and they are classified within general and administration expenses.\nAdvertising costs totaled approximately $1,071, $1,021 and $1,160 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.\n\nStock-Based Compensation Compensation cost relating to stock-based awards made to employees and directors is recognized in the audited\nconsolidated financial statements using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Non-qualified awards are issued under the Company s\nstock-based compensation plan. The Company measures for the cost of such awards based on the estimated fair value of the award measured at\nthe grant date and recognizes the expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.\n\n71\n\n91",

Prior to July 28, 2010 the Company was not a publicly traded company.\nAccordingly, the Company had limited historical information on the price of its stock as well as employees stock option exercise behavior.\nBecause of this limitation, the Company cannot rely on its historical experience alone to develop assumptions for stock price volatility and the\nexpected life of its options. The Company estimates the expected life of its options using the Simplified Method .The Company estimates\nstock-price volatility with reference to a peer group of publicly traded companies. Determining the companies to include in this peer group\ninvolves judgment. The Company utilizes a risk-free interest rate, which is based on the yield of U.S. zero coupon securities with a maturity\nequal to the expected life of the options. The Company has not and does not expect to pay dividends on its common shares.\n\nThe Company is required to estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for\nthose awards expected to vest. The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the forfeiture\nassumptions may impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period. Estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in\nsubsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances.\n\nCorrections for a Prior Period Error During the third quarter of 2010, the Company identified an approximate $994 tax error related to preparing\nthe year-end estimated federal net operating loss carryforward for 2007. Accordingly, the consolidated balance sheet for December 31, 2009 has\nbeen adjusted to reduce Deferred tax assets by $994 with a corresponding $994 adjustment recorded as an increase to Accumulated deficit . The\nCompany also recorded a $994 adjustment to Accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2007 in the consolidated statements of stockholders\n\nequity. The correction of this error does not impact the consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows contained\n\nin this report and this correction was not considered material to prior period financial statements.\n\nReclassifications Certain reclassifications were made to the December 31, 2009 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the 2010 presentation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that enables vendors to account for products or services sold to customers\n(deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit, as was generally required by past guidance. The revised guidance provides for two\nsignificant changes to the existing multiple element revenue arrangement guidance. The first change relates to the determination of when\nindividual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. The second change modifies\nthe manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables. This guidance also significantly\nexpands the disclosures required for multiple-element revenue arrangements. The guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning on\nor after June 15, 2010, but early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material\nimpact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible\nproducts and software elements so that tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to\ndeliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in ASC Subtopic 985-605.\nIn addition, this guidance requires hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the\nsoftware revenue guidance. The guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal years\n\n72\n\n92",

As a result of the Company s initial public offering effective July 28, 2010, certain terms of the warrant were determined in\naccordance with the warrant agreement and the Company reclassified the estimated fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2010.\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities of the Company measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant\nunobservable inputs (Level 3) for the period from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010:\n\nWarrant\nBalance at December 31, 2009 $ -\nIssuance 2,360\nBalance at March 31, 2010 2,360\nChange in fair value 586\nBalance at June 30, 2010 2,946\nTransfer to additional paid in capital (2,946)\nBalance at September 30, 2010 $ -\n\n104",

In assessing the\nrealizability of this deferred tax asset, management determined that it was more-likely-than-not that all of this asset would not be realized and\naccordingly recorded an increase to our valuation allowance in the amount of $926. The valuation allowance for net deferred tax as s of\nDecember 31, 2009 and 2010 was $2,517 and $3,444, respectively. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2009 was related to capital\nlosses of $1,230 and Federal and state net operating losses of $1,287 primarily due to Section 382 limitations. The valuation allowance as of\nDecember 31, 2010 was related to capital losses of $2,157 and Federal and state net operating losses of $1,287 primarily due to Section 382\nlimitations. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the\ndeferred tax assets will be realized.\n\n \n\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which net operating\nlosses and temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities (including\nthe impact of available carry-back and carry-forward periods), projected taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment.\nIn order to fully realize the deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax\nassets governed by the tax code. Based on the level of taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the\nnet operating losses are available and deferred tax assets are deductible, management of the Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that\nit will realize the benefits of the net operating losses and any other deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable\nhowever, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOn July 28, 2010, in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, the Company entered into a merger transaction with the Envestnet\nShareholder (Note 15).

The difference is charged to equity in the case of a windfall. When the exercise results in a\nwindfall and the windfall results in net operating loss ( NOL ), or the windfall increases an NOL carryforward, no windfall is recognized until the\ndeduction reduces the income tax payable. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Company has deferred the recognition of approximately $523 in\n\nwindfall tax benefits associated with its stock-based compensation until a tax cash savings is realized. The benefit will be recorded in\n\nstockholder s equity when utilized on an income tax return to reduce taxes payable, and as such, it will not impact the Company s effective tax\nrate.\n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the Company has not provided for taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of $1,596 that it considers permanently\nreinvested.\n\n82\n\n110",

Historically, determining the fair value of our common stock required making subjective judgments. The valuation of our\ncommon stock considered a market approach and an income approach, incorporating the Company s historical and expected financial\nperformance, relevant market, industry and economic trends, recent capital transactions, involving either the Company or comparable\ncompanies, and comparable public company valuations. The resulting calculation assigns a value for 100% of our Company s equity on a\nmarketable equivalent, non-controlling interest basis.\n\nAfter the value of the Company had been determined, the Company allocated the value to each class of its shares, including common stock. The\nvalue allocation methodology applies the principles set forth in the AICPA Practice Aid Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities\nIssued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The Practice Aid defines appropriate methods to allocate enterprise value to common shares when\nmultiple share classes exist. Based on various factors, including the stage of acompany s life and the timing and likelihood of various liquidity\nevents, one method of allocation may be more appropriate than the others. The Company used the option pricing method, as defined in the\nPractice Aid, which treats each class of equity as having a call option on the enterprise value. The option pricing method considers the economic\npreferences and other rights attributable to each share class, resulting in a price for each of the share classes, including common stock. The\nvaluations of common stock also reflected a discount for lack of marketability, adjusted over time to reflect the expected likelihood and timing\nof a liquidity event subsequent to each valuation date. No other discounts were applied in determining the value of the Company s common\nstock. There was inherent uncertainty in the estimates used in the valuations. If different discount rates, assumptions or weightings had been\nused, the valuations would have been different.\n\nFrom January 1, 2009 through July 27, 2010, the Company performed contemporaneous valuations to determine the fair value of the Company s\ncommon stock at the following dates:\n\nGrant Date Fair Market Value\nFebruary 16, 2009 - April 8, 2009 $ 7.85\nMay 15, 2009 - July 6, 2009 7.15\nNovember 16, 2009 11.50\nFebruary 22, 2010 13.45\n\nSince our initial public offering on July 28, 2010, we have not performed internal valuations or obtained independent valuations in order to\ndetermine the Company s stock price to reference when determining the fair value of our common stock in connection with the granting of stock\noptions.\n\n88\n\n120",

Under the two class method, net income is allocated between\ncommon stock and other participating securities based on their respective participating rights. All classes of convertible preferred stock would\nparticipate pro rata in dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. Therefore, the two class method of calculating net income\nper common share has been applied. Basic net income per common share excludes dilution for potential common stock issuances and is\ncomputed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the\nperiod. Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common\nstock were exercised or converted into common stock, unless they are anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010,\nconvertible preferred securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as their inclusion on an as if converted basis\nwould have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, the convertible preferred securities are considered anti-dilutive\nas a result of such securities not having the contractual obligation to participate in losses of the Company.
