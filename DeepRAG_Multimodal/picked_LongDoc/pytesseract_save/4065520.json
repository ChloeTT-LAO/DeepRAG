    "Page_7": "CHAPTER 1\n\n \n\nIntroduction\n\n \n\nDear user, thank you for having chosen the ESMETER® Monitoring System. E3 stands\nfor Energy, Environment and Efficiency with the goal to increase productivity for your data\ncenter monitoring.\n\nThe aim of the E3METER® products is to provide the following main functionalities:\n* Capacity management\n¢ Billing\n\n¢ Safety\n\n1.1 How to read this User Manual\n\nThis User Manual provides information about the configuration options of the ESMETER®\nMonitoring System. For those who want to create a basic configuration it is recommended\nto read the following chapters in the sequence presented hereafter:\n\n¢ Introduction\n\n¢ Accessing your Data Concentrator (CTR)\n¢ Initial setup\n\n¢ Adding meters\n\n¢ Data Concentrator pages\n\nFor those interested in all details, we recommend reading through the entire user manual and\nconsidering the table of contents and index in order to navigate to the specific area of interest.",
    "Page_8": "E3METER Monitoring Software User Manual, Data Concentrator 6.2 revA\n\n \n\n1.2 Capacity management\n\nCapacity management provides information about the remaining power capacity of a specific\nrack or data center element. By consulting historic data, this allows the user to forecast by\nwhen the available power capacity will be reached and when or where it makes sense to\nadd further data center resources. This information allows you to optimize the installation /\nmaintenance of your system and the involved costs.\n\n1.3 Billing\n\nElectrical power consumption in an average data center represents more than 50% of the run-\nning costs. The billing functionality allows you to know how much energy was consumed by\nwhich participant and to accurately bill the respective amount of energy to each participant.\nThe billing functionality provides the exact number of kWh consumed per unit of time.\n\n1.4 Safety\n\nA fully configured E3METER® Monitoring System provides Alarm functionality. Alarm\nfunctionality can be configured on the measured parameters: current, temperature and hu-\nmidity. When the observed parameter reaches the configured alarm threshold, the system\nimmediately notifies the user with an event. One additional safety function consists in phase\nbalancing. Since individual phases can be monitored and analyzed, this information can be\nused during commissioning or maintenance. You use this information in order to add new\ndevices without exceeding a safety limit for a phase current, preventing from impacting on\nthe system.\n\n1.5 Easy installation\n\nThe communication with the meters and Data Concentrator is done via powerline which\ndoes not require for additional cabling. Devices can be automatically paired with the Data\nConcentrator and parameters can be configured for multiple elements at once (bulk configu-\nration/edit). The software comes pre-configured and can be upgraded automatically for both\nthe Data Concentrator and the meters.\n\nThese elements make it a plug and play system and allow to get started quickly.\n\n \n\n2 Chapter 1. Introduction",
    "Page_9": "CHAPTER 2\n\n \n\nAccessing your Data Concentrator (CTR)\n\n \n\nIn order to access your Data Concentrator for the first time you need to read the IP address\nof the Data Concentrator on the display on the front panel. First check how your Data\nConcentrator is connected. It is either connected into a network using DHCP or via static\naddress or not yet connected to a network but directly connected to your PC. By default\nthe Data Concentrator is configured to use DHCP / AutoIP. When the Data Concentrator is\nconnected per AutoIP, make sure to wait for one minute after connection until you read the\nIP address of the Data Concentrator.\n\nTwo different network connections are shown below.\n\nOptional\nDHCP server\n\nLs\nE> ae\n\nmama Ethernet connection\n\nFig. 1: Connection method | in a network with optional DHCP server.",

On your\nwindows PC stick to the option Automatic to get an IP address.\n\n \n\n \n\nCaution: The Ethernet Port of the Data Concentrator is not compatible with Power over\nEthernet. Please deactivate Power over Ethernet on the port of the switch / router that\nwill be connected to the Data Concentrator before connecting the Ethernet cable. PoE\ncan cause the electronic of the Data Concentrator to malfunction or even destroy it.\n\n \n\n2.1 Connect to Data Concentrator\n\nPush the mode button on the front of the Data Concentrator until the IP address is being\nshown. Then, open your web browser and connect to your Data Concentrator using its IP\naddress and a secure connection (HTTPS).\n\nThe following shows a possible URL to be entered in the navigation bar\n\n© https://192.168.1.251\n\n \n\nNote: When using Zero Configuration (Bonjour), it is also possible to resolve the ad-\ndress with the serial number of the Data Concentrator. For this you need to enter the URL\nhttps://serial#.local in the navigation bar. A possible URL would be https://ctr-005756.local.\n\n \n\n2.2 Secure connection to web page\n\nThe connection to the web page of the Data concentrator is secured and encrypted using\nHTTPs. In order to achieve this, a self-signed SSL certificate needs to be accepted in your\nweb browser. With this secured connection you can assure that your valuable data is not\naccessed maliciously by others. When connecting for the first time to your Concentrator\nweb page, you will be asked to accept that SSL certificate. You need to navigate to the\nadvanced section and accept the self signed SSL certificate. The following sections show\n\n \n\n4 Chapter 2. Accessing your Data Concentrator (CTR)",

Either the PRO meters are\nconnected directly to the CTR using a USB to RS-485 converter or over a Modbus gateway.\nIn the case when interfacing via the gateway, the PRO meters communicate via Modbus RTU\nto the gateway and the gateway via Modbus TCP to the CTR.\n\nIn order to add PRO meters first click to Add Meters and then select PRO as shown in the\npicture below.

When showing longer time periods it shows the\nfollowing granularities 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week depending on the overall time shown.\n\n14.2 Synchronous polling\n\nThe E3METER® system allows to interface with meters either per PLC (Power Line Com-\nmunication), Ethernet or via RS485. With the communication per PLC or Ethernet the Data\nConcentrator (CTR) synchronizes the time base and polls data from the meters (IPS). This\nallows making sure that the IPS is synchronized with the CTR and to the Epoch as sym-\nbolized in the picture below with the little clock symbol and the green check mark. The\nadvantage of the ESMETER® system lies in the fact, that each IPS aggregates data within\nthe data polling period. Once the data polling period is over, e.g. with a period of 15 min-\nutes, the CTR polls the aggregated data of all IPS from the last polling period. In the picture\nbelow this is shown for the interval from minutes 45 to 00. Per data polling period, the ag-\ngregated data provides the average values as well as the minimum and maximum occurred\nduring the interval. All E3METER® use the proprietary communication protocol and poll\ndata in a timely manner. Meters other than E3METER® are not synchronized and provide\nonly instantaneous measurement values once they are polled.\n\n \n\n81",
