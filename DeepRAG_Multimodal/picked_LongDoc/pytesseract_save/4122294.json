The\nprimary objective of the CDBG Program (24 CFR 570) is to develop \"viable urban communities, by\nproviding decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities,\nprincipally for persons of low and moderate income.\"\n\nThe Town receives an annual allocation of CDBG entitlement funds. The annual allocation for Program\nYear 45 (2019-2020) was $480,319. The total amount that the Town expended during Program Year 45,\nas indicated in the Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) reports included, was\n$321,004, which includes the expenditures of funds carried over from prior years. In addition, $3,200 in\nProgram Income was generated during the Program Year.\n\nThe Town is committed to providing assistance to residents and within its target neighborhoods in a\ntimely and efficient manner. All activities undertaken during Program Year 45 addressed needs and\ngoals established in the 2015-2019 Consolidated Plan. 15% of the allocated funds were used for program\nadministration. Program administration funds were primarily used to fund half of the CD Program\nManager position; a part-time position to assist with program implementation and reporting; and travel\nand fees for HUD training; printing and publishing; and funds for consultant assistance with the creation\nof the CAPER for 2018, the Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing, and the new Five Year Consolidated\nPlan 2020-2024 Annual Action Plan for FY 2020.\n\nOver the program year the town expended its CDBG funds in a manner that ensured decent, safe and\naccessible housing for low and moderate income residents through its rehabilitation and downpayment\nassistance programs. First-time homeownership education is also supported with CDBG funding. CDBG\nfunds also supported the provision of shelter for homeless individuals; provided public service\nprogramming with a focus on youth, the elderly and disabled populations; upgraded community\ninfrastructure; and eliminated blighting conditions in the target area.\n\nDuring Program Year 45, the town provided rehabilitation assistance to low and moderate income\nhomeowners; provided accessibility improvements; assisted with first-time homeownership; provided\nsidewalk improvements in its community development target areas; provided sign grants to local\nbusiness owners in the target area; and addressed blighting influences in its lower income\nneighborhoods. Its public service programming provided meals, food delivery and food bank support to\n\nCAPER 1\n\nOMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018)",

Many physical activities, rehabilitation projects, and facilty and\ninfrastructure improvements were put on hold as local focus shifted to respond to the pandemic. Social\nservice programs also experienced a change from normal implementation to meet the needs of the\ncommunity as it sheltered in place. Because of this, actual outcomes and beneficiaries varied from the\nproposed accomplishments.\n\nCAPER 2\n\nOMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018)",

After a full\nyear of program implementation, the recently hired Director/Program Manager was able to administer\nthe residential rehabilitation program and the first-time homebuyer programs at a level which exceeded\nthe performance numbers seen over the past few years. The Town is now successfully expending\nresources and completing programs that the new director assumed from prior program years. The new\nCommunity Development Program Manager has increased community outreach, developed improved\nworking relationships with housing and service providers, and has improved recordkeeping and program\nimplementation over the term of his employment. The Program Manager is also charged with\nmanagement and oversight of all community services and employees located at the Keefe Community\nCenter. While these responsibilities can be time consuming they also provide collaborative\nopportunities and insight into the needs of some of the Town’s lowest income and most needy\nresidents. During the program year the Town created a new part-time position in the Office of\nCommunity Development to assist with community outreach, program implementation and reporting\nand recordkeeping. Annual accomplishment include:\n\ne Single Family Rehabilitation: Rehabilitation including emergency roof repairs, furnaces & fuel\nassistance, lead-based paint code violation correction, accessibility improvements, and energy\nupgrades. Eleven (11) housing units received assistance.\n\ne ADAlmprovements: Funds were utilized to provide handicap ramp and entry improvements to\none (1) household.\n\ne Commercial Rehabilitation: Funds were used to provide sign grants in the CD target\nareas.

DECD has a\nvariety of housing and community development related programs and funding opportunities are\nmade available throughout the State of Connecticut. DECD offers a host of housing programs,\nincluding first-time homeownership assistance, which the Town plans to market along with our\nTown sponsored housing programs. Recently, Census Tract 1655, Hamden’s Highwood\nneighborhood was designated as an Opportunity Zone by DECD. Opportunity Zones are created to\nattract private investment to improve economic growth, community wealth, business\ndevelopment, housing opportunities and infrastructure while creating jobs in economically\ndistressed areas. Opportunity Zones provide tax benefits to investors who invest in eligible\nprojects. Eligible projects may include, 1) Real estate projects, either new development or a\nbuilding in need of renovation; 2) Business investments; and/or 3) Energy efficiency and\nrenewable energy projects.

In past program years, the then named Department of Economic and Community\nDevelopment and Neighborhood Revitalization (DECDNR) spearheaded and worked with Town offices\nand the Mayor, to identify a Town-owned property for acquisition by Habitat for Humanity which\nallowed a low-income family to purchase the home at a price below market value.

The year-round shelter needs of the Town's homeless population are now\nprimarily met by facilities in New Haven, although shelters in Milford and Wallingford have also\nreported serving Hamden residents. The Community Services Department is the primary source for\nlocating shelter for the homeless. Healthcare outreach to homeless is provided through the Cornell\nScott Hill Health Center (CSHHC). Both CSHHC and Columbus House Outreach and Engagement\nTeams offer shelter intake and case management services to Hamden’s homeless. The town also\nworks with the Continuum of Care and Yale Behavioral Health Services of Hamden.\n\nThe Office of Community Development (OCD) has increased efforts to address homelessness\nover the past several years. The OCD works closely with the Columbus House, Inc. Outreach and\nEngagement Team to offer those experiencing homelessness shelter intake and case\nmanagement services. In addition, they work closely with the Cornell Scott Hill Health Center\nHomeless Healthcare Program to offer physical health, mental health, and substance abuse\nservices to Hamden’s homeless. These partnerships will be continued and expanded in the\ncoming years.
