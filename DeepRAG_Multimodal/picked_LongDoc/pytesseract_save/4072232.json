    "Page_5": "1 INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE PLANNING PROCESS\n\n \n\n \n\nExplanatory notes\n\nFor this version of the management plan, we have relied heavily on information from the recent work with the\nWatershed Improvement Districts to characterize and map both agricultural and watershed priorities in the six WIDs.\n\nIn this document, we have included text, maps and tables contained in the Laurel WID Agriculture-Watershed\nCharacterization and Mapping Report (2016: the “WID mapping report”)! as reference materials. By including the\nactual information here where possible rather than cross-referring out to separate reports, we hope to make this\ndocument easier to use. Wherever necessary, we have noted the sources for text, maps and tables that have been\ncopied into this document.\n\nThe focus in this version of the Management Plan will be on clarifying the WID’s priority issues and goals. These\npriorities and goals should be the basis for further development of the Management Plan to include actions, budgets\nand timelines as this information becomes available. Where WID actions have already been initiated, these have\nbeen included in this version of the Management Plan.\n\n \n\n1.1 Process for developing a Management Plan for the WID\n\nWe envisage three main stages in the planning process:\n¢ First, preparing an outline for a Management Plan, that includes an overview of initial WID priorities\nand of the available background information (see Tables 1 and 2 particularly).\n¢ Second, preparing a Management Plan (this document) to include agreed near-term actions to\nadvance the WID’s priorities. The Plan is based on available information generated in recent and\ncurrent efforts, including:\n-  theall-WID planning session in March 2017,\n- work sessions for the Ag-Watershed Characterization and Mapping in 2016,\n- ongoing water quality monitoring by the WID and the Conservation District, and\n- ongoing drainage management work within the WID.\nWhere additional baseline technical studies might be needed, the scope of work and estimated costs\nfor these studies will be included in successive versions of the Management Plan.\n¢ Third, refining the Management Plan over time as resources and funding are secured to undertake\nthe necessary baseline technical studies for each component of the Plan.\n\n1 Whatcom County Agriculture-Watershed Pilot Project (2016).

    "Page_6": "1.2 Purpose and content of this document\n\nThe purpose of this document is to assist the WID board in developing and implementing their\ncomprehensive M anagement Plan over time.\n\nThis document contains the first Management Plan for the Laurel Watershed Improvement District (WID).\nSuccessively more detail and technical information will be added to sections of the Plan over time as\nresources allow.\n\nIn preparing this document, we have collated recent and current information on WID management\npriorities and concerns from a number of sources. Where technical and background information was\nreadily available and could be provided without additional analysis or processing, we have included it in\nthe relevant sections and appendices of this document. Other sections in this document are limited to a\ndescription of the content that might be included in a comprehensive Management Plan but for which\nadditional work might be needed to prepare such content.\n\nSection 2 contains a list of priority issues and objectives for the WID, stated as “desired outcomes”. A\nsummary list is shown in Table 1, and the process for coming up with the initial suggested list of issues is\ndescribed. A more detailed list of priority issues, suggested goals against which to measure progress, and\ninitial actions for consideration by the WID board is shown in Table 2.\n\nSections 3 and 4 provide a summary of available background and baseline information about the\nwatershed and agricultural systems within the Laurel WID.\n\nSection 6 contains supporting information on additional work and baseline studies that might be needed\n\nto prepare an action plan to achieve the WID’s priorities. Actions might include:\n\n* actions that the WID board is already undertaking or that could be initiated in future in collaboration\nwith farmers in the WID, without the need for extra resources or expertise;\n\n* actions that the WID is already undertaking or could undertake in future with the assistance and\ncollaboration of key partners such as the Conservation District and drainage districts;\n\n* actions that will require additional technical resources and for which the WID and partners will\nprobably need to seek grant funding.\n\n \n\nAppendices contain additional reference information, some which is reproduced from other sources but\nwhich has been included with this document for readers’ convenience.\n\nVersion 3 (April 2018) 2",
    "Page_7": "2 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND DESIRED OUTCOMES\n\n2.1 Process for developing the list of suggested priorities\n\nThe project team used the following process to develop the list of suggested priorities in Tables 1 and 2\n\nfor discussion by the WID board.\n\n1. We began with the set of priorities that were previously listed on the Laurel WID website? (water\nquality and water rights).\n\n2. We reviewed all Laurel WID board meeting minutes back to January 2015? to collect relevant\nstatements and decisions made by the WID board and grouped those statements or decisions into\npriority topics (comprehensive planning; drainage; flood management; habitat; outreach;\nrepresentation; water quality; water quantity; water rights).\n\n3. We added priorities identified in the February 2016 work session and described in the Laurel WID\nAgriculture-Watershed Characterization and Mapping Report* (habitats and species; water flow\nprocesses; agricultural land protection).\n\n4. The list of priorities and potential priority actions was revised after the WID Work Session held in\nLynden on March 20°, 2017.\n\n5. We built a master spreadsheet listing the main priorities that had been identified and discussed by\nthe WID in all of the various processes mentioned above. Where the WID board had also discussed\nor decided on near-term actions associated with a priority, we included those in the spreadsheet. The\nmaster spreadsheet is available as an electronic document and provides the raw material for the\nsuggested priorities described in this section.\n\n6. Wegenerated a set of suggested priorities (see Table 1 below), and then added desired outcomes and\nnear-term actions using draft wording drawn from previous WID documents, statements and\ndecisions (see Table 2 below). The material in these tables serves as a starting point around which\nthe WID board could build their Management Plan and associated actions.\n\n7. We also compared the list of WID priorities to relevant policy statements and goals in two related\nplanning documents, namely the Whatcom County Comprehensive Plan (2016 update)° and the\nWRIA1 Watershed M anagement Project's statement of goals (2008).° The goal statements in these\ntwo planning documents offer additional context for the Laurel WID’s own priorities, and are shown\nalongside the suggested WID priorities in Appendix D.\n\n8. We attended the Tenmile Watershed Forum held at the Whatcom Conservation District on 1 March\n2018, and added information from that event to the tables of suggested priorities, and to the section\nin this Plan on previous and current watershed management efforts in the Tenmile watershed.\n\n2.2 Suggested priorities and desired outcomes for the Laurel WID\n\nEach agreed strategic priority should ideally have one or more desired outcomes attached to it, which\n\nwould then be used to:\n\n¢ establish measurable goals against which progress can be measured and reported regularly, and\n\n¢ identify actions, an implementation schedule, scope of work and resources needed for\nimplementation (see Table 2).\n\n2 See https://www.laurelwid.com/projects\n\n3 See https://www.laurelwid.com/minutes\n\n4 See Appendix A of this document (WID mapping report executive summary)\n\n5 Whatcom County Comprehensive Plan, adopted August 2016. http://wa-whatcomcounty.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/21056\n® WRIA1 Watershed M anagement Project (2008).

This informs the discussion about what actions are needed for both agriculture and watersheds,\nwhich actions are practical and feasible in the landscape given the topography, soils and hydrology, and where\nspecific actions would be most effective in achieving both agricultural and watershed priorities.\n\n \n\nBefore European settlement, there were major Nooksack Indian Tribe settlements concentrated near the\npresent cities of Lynden and Everson, and at the forks of the Nooksack River. The Tribe’s territory included\nthe major part of the Nooksack lowland. M any well-defined trails northward facilitated their trade with\nthe Sumas, Chilliwack, and M atsqua bands of British Columbia, as well as The Hudson’s Bay Company at\nFort Langley. The Nooksacks also conducted more limited trade with tribes to the south and west, the\nSemiahmoo, Lummi, and Skagit.2° A trail from Bellingham to present-day Everson known as the Whatcom\nTrail was used to access clamming areas, and other shellfish grounds, on Bellingham Bay and also to\nconduct trade between tribal communities on Birch Bay and in Canada.” Another trail stretched from\nDakota Creek in Semiahmoo territory east to the Kamm Creek watershed and then roughly north to\nCanada.’ Native Americans also used the extensive waterways of a huge wetland complex between\nFishtrap Creek and the Fraser River to travel.\n\nThe map shown in Figure 5 was prepared in 1858 and shows local topography and wildlife “of special\ninterest” to the tribes in the area at the time.\n\nIn addition to relying on salmon, gathered fruits and vegetables, shellfish, and wild game for food, the\nNooksack people utilized prairie land to cultivate “Indian carrots,” a prized food item, and also to harvest\nfern roots and camas bulbs. After the potato was introduced to the Tribe by the Hudson’s Bay Company\nsometime after the establishment of Fort Langley in 1828, the Nooksack people began cultivating and\ntrading it as well. ¢\n\n10 Jeffcott, P R. 1949.

Nooksack Place Names, Geography, Culture, and\nLanguage (Richardson and Galloway, 2011)!’ provides information about named places in historic\nNooksack territory. Nek’iyéy is the name given to “Ten Mile Prairie,” located where the Whatcom trail\ncrossed Tenmile Creek (the authors state that the name also applies to Tenmile Creek). This was the site\nof a Nooksack village*® and the Hudson Bay Company established a Trading Post at this location, as well.?9\nAccording to Richardson and Galloway, the location of the prairie is indicated today by the low wet area\ncrossed by Hemmi Road from ¥to ¥% mile east of Hannegan Road.”°\n\nJust south of the WID, there was a prairie called Sq’elaxen. This name also refers to a group of people\nwho occupied the area in the early to mid-19\"\" century. Percival Jeffcott wrote in Nooksack Tales and\nTrails: Historical Stories of Whatcom County, “a small band of Indians had their homes on a small prairie\nthat extended from the east bank of the Nooksack back to near Nu-klus-kum (Barrett Lake) and Deer\nCreek... . also it was the natural habitat of the camas and shu-guack or wild carrot.”2+ | effcott also stated\nthat John Tennant claimed a portion of this prairie which implies that it extended further south to Tennant\nLake,”\n\nPrairie areas intermixed with wetlands were described in a letter written by a William Smith and published\nin the Northern Light on July 2, 1858. Smith, who traveled northeast along the Whatcom Trail, which ran\nthrough the eastern portion of the Laurel WID area, described the land as follows: “The first water and\ngrasses are on Six Mile Prairie. Five miles on, water. Two small streams between that and Lummy\n[Nooksack] River. Prairie for 18 miles to the base of mountain, with plenty of water.”’? Another account,\nhowever, emphasizes the forests along the trail. Janet Oakley in her HistoryLink.org article “Construction\nbegins on the Whatcom Trail” writes of Nekiyéy [sic] (Ten Mile Prairie mentioned above), the trail\n“wandered through beaver ponds and heavy forests and crossed the creek.”**\n\nOf the historic prairies near present-day Lynden, Collins and Sheikh, in their 2004 report Historical riverine\ndynamics and habitats of the Nooksack River state that “indigenous populations may have created and\nmaintained this forest opening (and likely other, small, unmapped openings) as was common in other\nPacific Northwest environments ..., or they may have been natural openings created by wet soils.”\n\n17 Richardson, A., B.

    "Page_25": "Nooksack Place Names, Geography, Culture, and Language® provides some information about named\nwater resources in historic Nooksack territory. Nuxwq’échqsem is the Nooksack name given to Barrett\nLake. Richardson and Galloway report this swampy expansion of Tenmile Creek was caused by a beaver\ndam half a mile above the mouth.** The authors report that the upper portions of Nek’iyéy (referring to\nTenmile Creek not Tenmile Prairie in this case) were fished for silver salmon.*° Louise Johnson in her book\nTales of Tenmile reports the salmon in Tenmile were abundant in the early 1900s. She writes “as [salmon]\ncame up the creek through our place, they would be so thick, Father would take a pitchfork and pitch a\nfew onto the creek bank. He would try to find one that was firm of flesh so we could have fresh salmon\nto eat,” and goes on to say that the carcasses were plowed into the fields “or the odor would have been\nunbearable.”26\n\nIn addition to these Nooksack named places, there are two describing water resources just north of the\nLaurel WID. Lhelhdkw’ey, the Nooksack name for what is now called Wiser Lake, means “many-flying\nplace.” The shallow lake had a marshy border that was good for waterfowl.?” And Kw’ishilwalh, now\nknown as Fountain Lake, was a small lake with a marshy border where Indian potatoes were gathered.\nWild cranberries and Labrador (swamp) tea used to grow in a bog off the east side of the lake. °\n\nRichardson and Galloway catalogue two more named places in the area of the Laurel WID about which\nlittle is known. Spelcoke is the name Henry Custer used to describe a stream believed to be one of the\nupper branches of Deer Creek. When traveling southwest on the Whatcom Trail in 1858 he wrote “crosse\nalittle stream, Spelcoke.” This is the only recorded use of the name. *° Sqelaw7 isthe name given to Green\nLake. No specific Nooksack use of the lake is recorded, but beaver and waterfowl could have been hunted,\nand useful plants could have been gathered there.“?\n\nTales of Ten Mile: 1888 to 1940 offers insights into the wildlife in the area in the late 1800s. The author\nrelates a story about her grandfather Marion Myer’s conversations with a Nooksack man named Mr.\nJohnson. Mr. Johnson would spend the night with her grandfather on occasion when on his way to New\nWhatcom (the towns of Whatcom and Sehome merged to become New Whatcom in 1891, and the name\nwas changed to Whatcom in 1901). According to the author, Mr. Johnson told Mr. Myers that before\nEuropeans settled the area deer and elk were plentiful and the Nooksacks “trapped muskrats, mink, otter\nand beaver. The creek was much bigger than it is now. Beaver, which were plentiful, built many dams\nacross the creek, so the lowlands were flooded. . . The furs were sold to buyers for the Hudson Bay\n\n33 Richardson, A., B. Galloway, 2011. Nooksack Place Names. Geography, Culture and Language. Vancouver, CA:\nUBC Press\n34 Richardson, A., B.

The fish we caught were smoked in smoke-houses\nnear the creek.” The author also states that “when the M yers family arrived in 1888 there were still black\nbear in the woods,” but as the author grew up (she was born in 1914) there were no bear, deer, cougar\nor bobcat living in the nearby woods. However, there were muskrat living in the banks of the creek, and\nmink in the area as well. Cotton-tail rabbits were common. Raccoons, mountain beaver, fox, skunks,\nweasels, squirrels, and chipmunks also lived in the area. The author goes on to list the birds she commonly\nencountered at Tenmile. She reports kingfishers, great blue herons, meadowlarks, killdeer, yellow\ngoldfinches, wild pigeons, barn swallows, cliff swallows, hawks, owls, woodpeckers, flickers, robins,\nsparrows, finches, wrens, blackbirds, crows, bluejays, chickadees, junco, towhee, thrush, ruffed grouse,\nand hummingbirds were all present as well as a few non-native species, namely Chinese pheasants,\nbobwhite quail, and Hungarian pheasants. She writes that English sparrows, house finches, and starlings\nwere not found in the area.?\n\nThe record of Nooksack place names offers another glimpse into historic wildlife populations. On the\nwestern bank of the Nooksack, just across from the mouth of Tenmile Creek, Xwxach'tem was a camp and\nhouse historically used by elk hunters as well as people travelingto Bellingham Bay (the name Xwxach'tem\nis also used to describe the site of Ferndale).’2\n\nCollins and Sheik (2004) *? report that field notes from the GLO cadastral survey from 1859-1893 describe\nforests dominated by hardwoods. Red alder was the most common tree and was found at all elevations.\nWestern red cedar was the most common conifer as well as the largest tree. Sitka spruce, Pacific\ncrabapple, willow, and birch were found in the lower elevations, black cottonwood was found at moderate\nelevations, and western hemlock at the highest elevations. Adjacent to the river, black cottonwood and\nSitka spruce were the largest-diameter trees and cottonwood was almost as abundant as alder. Further\naway from the river, Douglas fir and cedar were the largest trees. Within wetlands, the tree species\ncomposition was similar to streamside forest, except cottonwood was absent, few trees were large, and\nbirch and crabapple were more common.”“* Within the area of the Laurel WID, the “timber” species\nmentioned most frequently in the cadastral survey notes were fir, cedar, alder, and spruce, and the\nundergrowth species mentioned most frequently were willow, alder, fir, hardhack, and vine maple. 4° 4°47\n\n1 Johnson, L. 1981.

In Tales of Ten Mile, 1888 to 1940,* the author describes the process of\nclearing land for a farm in the Ten Mile area. The land purchased by Marion Myers and his wife Carrie in\n1888, was adjacent to the Telegraph Road (which followed the Whatcom Trail) near what is now the\nintersection of Hannegan and E. Hemmi Roads.** The author writes, “the farm was covered with huge\ntrees which had to be removed before the land could be put under cultivation. The cedar trees were of\nvalue...” as cedar wood was put to many uses but, “The value of the fir tree was so little that huge trees\nwere burned in order to remove them from the land. There were other trees growing on the acreage that\nMarion Myers purchased, spruce, cottonwood, willow, hemlock, maple, vine maple, alder, birch and\ncascara.

    "Page_28": "By 1880 agricultural settlements were distributed throughout the Whatcom County region with a\nrelatively large number of settlers in Ferndale, Lynden, and Everson.™ The first agricultural efforts were\nsimple subsistence farming, but by 1885 the settlers began large scale clearing of the land to support\nmarket agriculture. In Tales of Tenmile, the author relates stories about her father’s childhood in the\nlate 1800s. Her account describes the M yers family raising dairy cows, growing grass for pasture and hay;\ngrowing oats, wheat, barley, and strawberries; slaughtering pigs, “beef,” and chickens; and eating beans\nand potatoes. Marion Myers, her grandfather, became one of the first chicken farmers in Whatcom\nCounty and, hoping to serve the market for fruit created when a cannery opened in Bellingham in 1887,\nplanted nearly ten acres of fruit trees. The author's account of her maternal grandparents’ farm in the\nTenmile area, which they purchased in 1903, includes horses, cows, a pig, chickens, geese, and Belgian\nhares. Her grandfather, Hans Seiness, dug a well to keep milk, cream, and butter cool, and built a cellar\nto store “potatoes, apples, carrots, onions, or other garden produce.”® In the 1890s, there were 30 to 40\norchards within a four-mile radius of Ferndale, and the cannery and condensery industries grew.\n\nJeffcott (1949) provides some insight into the rapid expansion of agriculture in the nearby Ferndale area\nwith his brief account of David R. Henderson who arrived in Whatcom County in 1873. Predicting a future\ntrain route through Ferndale “he therefore sought for land in that section and found a claim one mile\nnorth of the present city. By dint of hard labor and frugality he cleared a large part of his land and set it\nto orchard, expecting to realize handsomely from his fruit when the population of the county increased\nas he figured it must. Unfortunately, too many other pioneers had the same dreams of quick returns from\norchards and the scheme was overdone...”®\n\nThe Nooksack valley's forests and wetlands were transformed within the first few decades of settlement.\nBy the beginning of the 20‘ century, most of the native forest had been burned or logged, and most\nwetlands had been diked and ditched. By 1938, the burned or logged lands in the lower mainstem were\nalmost entirely converted to agriculture.®\n\n6° Tremaine, D.G. 1975.

Tenmile Creek watershed has been the focus and home of numerous enhancement efforts in the recent\npast.\n\nThe following section is a summary of previous and current efforts arranged in roughly chronological order. For\nsome projects, very little information was available and the description here is short, and for others there was a\ngreat deal of information available and the description is accordingly more detailed. Where there was clear\nrelationship between projects, that has been noted.\n\n \n\n1987 to 1991: Tenmile Creek Watershed Action Plan\n\nIn 1987, the Whatcom Conservation District was awarded funds to develop and implement a watershed\nmanagement plan for the Tenmile Creek watershed under the Puget Sound Early Action Watershed\nProgram.)\n\n1992 - 1996: Ten Mile Creek Watershed Action Plan\n\nIn 1992, the Whatcom Conservation District implemented a project along Tenmile Creek called the “Ten\nMile Creek Watershed Action Plan Implementation Project,” funded at least in part by a Centennial grant\nfrom the Department of Ecology. The project entailed providing technical assistance to landowners on\nbest management practices, conducting a land-use and wetlands inventory for the purpose of better\nunderstanding non-point water quality problems, and stream rehabilitation activities in cooperation with\nthe Nooksack Indian Tribe, and other government agencies. 19\n\n1994 - 1995: Riparian restoration and maintenance in the Kamm and Tenmile watersheds\nIn 1994, the Whatcom County Conservation District was awarded a grant from the Department of Ecology\nto restore and maintain riparian habitat, monitor water quality, experiment with methods to control reed\ncanary grass, and provide education to complement Best Management Practice (BM P) implementation.\nAccomplishments for the project as a whole (both Kamm and Tenmile watersheds) include:\n\n¢ Constructed 1.5 miles of fencing to exclude livestock from streams.\n\n¢ Planted native trees and shrubs along 4.25 miles of streams.\n\ne Installed three alternative animal access structures for livestock watering.\n\n* Constructed two off-site watering facilities for livestock. 1?\n\n1994-2008: Riparian restoration, instream enhancement, and livestock fencing work done by the\nNooksack Salmon Enhancement Association\n\nNSEA has conducted habitat-related work in the Tenmile watershed since 1994.1%4 From 2002 to 2005,\nNSEA participated in the Tenmile Creek Riparian Restoration Pilot and its sub-project, the Fourmile Creek\nWatershed Buffer Planting.

The\nresults are intended to support integrated land and water planning\nat watershed scale, and to support the identification and\nprioritization of agricultural and watershed enhancement actions at\nfarm and reach scale. These products will be provided to the\nWatershed Improvement Districts (WIDs) and Special Districts to\ninform and complement their current comprehensive planning\nwork.\n\nThe full characterization and mapping report for the Laurel WID?\ncontains the reference information, work session information and\nresults of the agriculture-watershed characterization and analysis\nconducted in 2016.

Thus “agricultural enhancement” and “agricultural\nprotection” include but are not limited to agricultural land protection alone.\n\n¢ watershed enhancement actions are those actions which improve the ability\nof the watershed to provide its natural benefits and services to communities.\nWatershed enhancement includes the idea of “repairing” major landscape\nprocesses related to hydrology and ecosystems, in order to maintain, protect\nor improve the delivery of watershed services.\n\n \n\n3 Links to each WID website can be found at\n\nhttp://www.agwaterboard.com/\n4 See http://www.co.whatcom.wa.us/2260/Agricultural-W atershed-Pilot-\n\nProject",

The work session participants\nreviewed this information, provided additional local field knowledge\non site-specific watershed priorities, and identified potential actions\nor projects that could help to achieve watershed priorities.\n\nA more detailed description of the watershed characterization\nmethodology is provided in section 5 and Appendix C of the main\nreport.\n\n7 Watershed ‘characterization’ is a set of water and habitat assessments that compare areas\nwithin a watershed for restoration and protection value. It is a coarse-scale tool that supports\ndecisions regarding where on the landscape should efforts be focused first, and what types\nof actions are most appropriate to that place.” See\nhttp://www.ecy.wa.gov/puget_sound/characterization/index.html",
    "Page_73": "Agricultural analysis\n\nThe results of the agricultural characterization and mapping for the\nLaurel WID include tables and summary maps which describe the\nagricultural services that are most needed for the long-term success\nof agriculture, and where they could be enhanced in the watershed.\nThe primary focus was on the “natural infrastructure” for\nagriculture: soils, water, adequate drainage and flood protection,\nand long-term protection of the agricultural land base.\n\nMethods used to prioritize agricultural needs are based on a\ncombination of: information from (i) existing agricultural protection\nprograms in Whatcom County, (ii) available GIS data contained in\nthe agricultural reference maps (see section 6 of the main report)\nand (iii) local knowledge provided at the WID work session.\n\nAt the WID work session, participants assisted the project team to\ncollate and evaluate information on agricultural system needs and\npriorities in the WID area, and to locate the different agricultural\nsystem needs and priorities on base maps of the WID area. A more\ndetailed description of the methodology is provided in section 3 of\nthe main report.\n\nApplication: How to use the results of the agriculture-watershed\ncharacterization and mapping\n\nThe WID can use the characterization maps and tables of\nagricultural and watershed priorities to support their land and water\nplanning, management, and project funding.\n\nThe characterization maps and tables should help the WID to\nidentify, prioritize, and strategically locate practical beneficial\nprojects and actions at the farm or reach-scale, and to enhance\nagricultural operations and watershed functions in the WID area.\n\nAppendix A\n\nThe characterization maps and tables should also help the WID\nidentify project opportunities that enhance watershed processes\nwhile strengthening agriculture where agricultural and watershed\npriorities are complementary, and to find acceptable trade-offs\nwhere they compete.\n\nThese results, which incorporate local knowledge and farmer\ninsights, may also be used to communicate the WIDs’ priority\nenhancement needs to planners for consideration in broad scale\nplanning such as Whatcom County's Comprehensive Planning\nProcess. More information on how to use these results in planning\ncan be found in the Ag-Watershed Project Fact Sheet 5, included as\nAppendix D of the main report.\n\nSummarized results for the Laurel Watershed\nImprovement District\n\nThe summary table below (Table 1) and the summary maps in\nFigure 2 highlight the most significant watershed and agricultural\nenhancement opportunities within the Laurel WID area. Check\nmarks in Table 1 indicate where a specific enhancement priority was\nidentified during the characterization and mapping process.\n\nDetailed descriptions of priorities, the sources of data or\ninformation on priorities, and descriptions of each priority and the\nopportunities for enhancement through specific actions can be\nfound in Tables 3 and 5 of the main report.",
