    "Page_3": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\nAbstract\n\nThe five-yearly Census of Population and Dwellings is a very important item on Tokelau’s agenda.\nIts results provide the most authoritative data on how many people we have, what the\ncomposition of their households is, what education level they have, how they contribute to\nTokelau’s economy, and so on.\n\nAs anon-self- governing territory, Tokelau has a special constitutional relationship with New\nZealand. This special relationship is strengthened by connections between the tiny Tokelau\nNational Statistics Office (TNSO) and Statistics NZ. It is the latter organisation that has been\nlargely responsible for the excellent Tokelau Censuses in 2006, 2011, and again in 2016.\n\nWith the publication of Profile of Tokelau:2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings, we now\nhave a very reliable time series over an entire decade with a wealth of data that are fully\ncomparable (which is not always the case with 5-yearly censuses that were conducted prior to\n2006).\n\nIn addition to objective data (‘things you can count’), this report includes a number of subjective\nmeasures (‘how you feel about things’), especially around the topic of ‘quality of life’. This is a\n‘first’ for the Tokelau census. Tokelauans generally consider themselves mostly very ‘happy and\nhealthy’, as the reader will see.\n\nThe current census is notable for another reason: it is our first one (indeed in the entire Pacific\nregion) to have been conducted using tablet computers rather than paper-based questionnaires.\nAssistance from the Pacific Community (SPC) is gratefully acknowledged. Not only did tablets\nfacilitate data entry and validation, data analysis was considerably faster.\n\nIt is with some pride that we completed the final 2016 Census report within six months of census\nday, 18 October 2016.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWithout the incessant energy and motivation of Mr Michael Berry - leading the wider Stats NZ\nCensus team of about 20 Wellington staff, supported strongly by Ms Sophie Davies and Ms Avril\nMacfarlane, and the Stats NZ editing team - there would have been little to show for.\n\nExtensive support in the Apia TNSO was given by Dr Jaap Jasperse and Mrs Mafa Mativa. Locally\ntrained interviewers conducted the questionnaires on the three atolls and in Apia, with the District\nSupervisors putting in a great job of data validation. All participants are gratefully acknowledged\nfor their hard work, not to mention all Tokelauans for their data, and the three Taupulega (village\ncouncils) for supporting the operations.\n\nSadly our National Statistician, Mr Kele Lui, was unable to partake in his favourite survey for this\nthird time, due to ill health. His presence and calmly persuasive style were at times sorely missed.\n\nNevertheless we think the 2016 Census was a great success, as evidenced by the series of official\nstatistics publications that have emanated from it, and of which the present work forms the\npinnacle.",

    "Page_8": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings was carried out on 18 October 2016. This\nreport marks the final official release from the census.\n\nProfile of Tokelau contains detailed analysis of population and demography, social and cultural\nlife, education, paid and unpaid employment, household and dwellings, and aspects of quality of\nlife for Tokelauans.\n\nThis report offers readers a comprehensive snapshot of life for the people of Tokelau in 2016.\nWhere possible, we’ve compared findings from the 2016 Census with those of the previous two\ncensuses in 2006 and 2011.\n\nThe 2016 Census was carried out by local enumeration staff, trained by Statistics New Zealand\n(Stats NZ) staff. Significant planning and consultation occurred in both Tokelau and New Zealand,\nto develop and carry out a census that best met the needs of the Tokelau public and policy\nmakers. Tokelau Public Service staff, key atoll stakeholders (including the general managers), staff\nfrom the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and subject matter experts from Stats NZ were\nconsulted on all aspects of the census throughout its development.\n\nThe 2016 Census form was based on the 2011 Census, although with substantial content\nadditions, most notably around including quality of life measures.\n\nTechnology changes\n\nBefore the 2016 Tokelau Census we decided to move from administering the census on paper, as\nwas done previously, to using a tablet-assisted questionnaire. Moving to CAPI (computer assisted\npersonal interviewing) was a carefully considered decision, motivated by a desire to produce high\nquality statistics for Tokelau decision-making as efficiently as possible.\n\nEnumerators in Tokelau for previous censuses wanted to use a format that was more user friendly,\nto let them more easily navigate the questionnaire and provide a better experience for\nrespondents. Paper questionnaires were used previously, which meant a considerable amount of\ntime and resource was used to enter the data before analysis could begin.\n\nThe ability to alert interviewers to mistakes they made (eg incorrectly entering the locations of a\n\nrespondent’s children based on a total number of children), and to direct them to questions they\nneed to ask of respondents, based on age or sex, meant we had to resolve far fewer errors during\nthe enumeration and post-enumeration phases.\n\nUsing tablets required more intensive training, which the trainers did well. The trade-offs in time\nspent training were more than recouped in the post-census phase.\n\nStats NZ loaned the tablets and we used a World Bank programme (Survey Solutions) developed\nprimarily for developing countries to administer surveys and censuses to administer the 2016\nCensus.\n\nAs internet access in Tokelau can be limited, and at the time of the census there was no mobile\ndata capability on the atolls, we needed a wireless solution. Survey Solutions can collect data\noffline. When interviewers returned to the each atoll’s headquarters on census day, we used the\nwi-fi connection to upload the data to a server in Washington DC in the United States.",
    "Page_9": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\nAn additional benefit of the tablets was that once the data was uploaded to the server it was safe\nand secure. In previous censuses, although we had no issues, there was the risk that forms could\nbe lost between the census on the atolls and the data entry phase in Samoa.\n\nTokelau was the first place in the Pacific to use tablets to conduct their census.\n\nChallenges of measuring Tokelau’s population\n\nChapter 4, Population structure, explores Tokelau’s migratory characteristics. The high degree of\nmigration poses a unique challenge in counting the population.\n\nIn the 2016 Census, approximately 20 percent of the usually resident population was away from\nTokelau. While Tokelauans travel overseas for many reasons, healthcare and education are two\nnotable reasons for absence. Due to the high number of people absent from Tokelau on census\nday, in 2006 we developed stringent criteria to determine who was a ‘usual resident’. These\ncriteria were applied consistently across the 2006, 2011, and 2016 Censuses.\n\nThe Tokelau Census team was committed to producing an accurate count of Tokelau’s population\nand ensuring we collected information about all usual residents. Demographic information was\ncompleted by the head of the household for usual residents who were away on census day\n(absentees). Where the whole household was absent on census day, the census day supervisor for\neach atoll was responsible for answering basic demographic information for the household. We\nalso collected information that allowed the team analysing the data to ascertain whether the\nabsentee was a usual resident (under the criteria).\n\nThe 2016 Census also collected information about Tokelauan members of the Tokelau Public\nService (TPS) and their families in Samoa.\n\nStats NZ’s role\n\nA special relationship exists between the Tokelau National Statistics Office (TNSO) and Stats NZ.\nStats NZ was contracted to conduct the Tokelau Censuses in 2006, 2011, and 2016. For the 2011\nand 2016 Censuses we seconded a statistics adviser from Stats NZ to TNSO, for two successive\nperiods of 2.5 years.\n\nThe main aim of the position (currently continued as a three-year separate employment contract)\nis to build the statistical capacity of the Tokelau people, so there is a degree of local self-\nsufficiency when it comes to official statistics. Other than census, the adviser’s focus is economic\nstatistics, such as calculating the quarterly consumer price index (CPI), since 2012, and various\nother indicators. We expect Stats NZ will continue to play a significant role in expanding and\nimproving TNSO’s work.\n\nThe purpose of Tokelau’s Census\n\nThe Tokelau Census provides detailed information about the entire population and dwellings of\nTokelau. There is currently no other source of official data about Tokelau collected on the same\nscale.\n\nCollecting data to make decisions is a primary purpose for the census. We hope the census data\nwill be particularly helpful for policy makers to make decisions that benefit Tokelau. Time-series\ninformation can be used to compare 2016 Census results with 2011 and 2006 results. However,\ndue to changes and additions to the latest census questionnaire, some time-series comparisons\nwon’t be possible.",
    "Page_10": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\n2 Geography and history\n\nGeography\n\nTokelau comprises three small coral atolls - Fakaofo, Nukunonu, and Atafu. Fakaofo sits roughly\n500 km north of Samoa. Nukunonu lies 64 kilometres north-west of Fakaofo, and Atafu lies 92\nkilometres north-west of Nukunonu.\n\nThe three atolls have four villages, with Nukunonu and Atafu having one each, and Fakaofo having\ntwo, with close ties between these two. All Tokelau’s villages are concentrated on the western\nsides of the atolls, close to small natural passes into the sheltered central lagoon. Canoes and\nsmall boats can enter the lagoon, while larger passenger and cargo boats drift in the deeper\nocean.\n\nTokelau has close ties to Samoa, with many Tokelauans living in Samoa. Boats transporting\npassengers and cargo arrive from Samoa approximately once a week. The only way to reach\nTokelau is by boat, which takes a minimum of 24 hours to reach the first atoll.\n\nThe low fertility of the coral soil in Tokelau means that few crops are supported. Coconuts,\nbreadfruit, and some bananas grow on the islands. Fish are an important food source. Food needs\nnot met by produce grown on the atoll are supplemented by imports.\n\nHistory and settlement\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that Tokelau was settled about 1,000 years ago. Linguistic records\nthat stretch back over the last few hundred years detail significant cultural shifts throughout the\n19th Century.\n\nOral traditions tell the three atolls were largely independent, while maintaining cultural and\nlinguistic similarities. A fourth island, Swains Island, is considered culturally part of Tokelau,\nalthough it is now administered by the United States as part of American Samoa.\n\nThe first European contact with Tokelau was reported in 1765. From the 1840s, Europeans\nincreased their exploration of the region, introducing new food and materials to Tokelau.\n\nIn the 1860s, Peruvian slave ships visited Tokelau and removed almost all able-bodied men from\nthe islands. Of the 253 men forcibly taken, most died of smallpox or dysentery - very few returned\nto Tokelau. The removal of almost the entire population of able-bodied men forced a change in\nthe governance structure of Tokelau. Tokelau moved towards a Taupulega system of governance,\nwhere families on each atoll are represented on the village Council of Elders (Taupulega).\n\nFrom 1877 to 1926, Tokelau was a British Protectorate.\n\nTokelau’s relationship with New Zealand\n\nIn 1926, the administration of Tokelau passed from Britain to New Zealand. However, Tokelau is\nrelatively autonomous with New Zealand providing a light-handed governance. Each atoll is\nresponsible for its own running, and since 2003 Tokelau has been responsible for administering its\nown national budget.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Tokelau ran two referendums to decide whether the country should become a\n‘self-governing state in free association with New Zealand’, a similar legal status as the Cook\n\n10",
    "Page_11": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\nIslands and Niue. Both referendums failed to reach the required margin to pass. Tokelau remains a\nnon-self-governing territory of New Zealand.\n\nRegardless of the future legal state of the relationship between Tokelau and New Zealand,\nTokelau will continue to have close ties with New Zealand. In New Zealand’s 2013 Census, more\n\nthan 7,000 people identifying as Tokelauan were living in New Zealand.\n\n11",
    "Page_12": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\n3 Population definitions\n\nThe 2016 Tokelau Census used three main population counts to define the population of Tokelau.\nEach count has an important difference, and people need to understand these differences to be\nable to use the most appropriate count.\n\nIn figures 3.1 to 3.3, a dark blue box indicates the group is included in the population count, and a\nlight blue box indicates the group is excluded from the count.\n\nDe jure usually resident population\n\nThe de jure usually resident population count includes the usually resident population present in\nTokelau on census night plus usual residents who are temporarily overseas at the time of the\ncensus. Those temporarily overseas include Tokelauan employees of the Tokelau Public Service\n(TPS) based in Apia, and their immediate families, and usual residents who are temporarily\noverseas.\n\nThe de jure usually resident count is the one that determines the number of representatives for\neach atoll in the General Fono (parliament).\n\nFigure 3.1 illustrates which groups are included and excluded from the 2016 Tokelau Census de\njure usually resident population count.\n\nNote: TPS is Tokelau Public Service.\n\nFigure 3.1\n\nComposition of the de jure usually resident population\n\nUsual residents Usual residents\npresent in absent from\nTokelau on Tokelau on\n\ncensus night census night\n\nTokelauan TPS\n\nemployees and\n\ntheir immediate\nfamilies\n\n \n\n12",

It gives a detailed breakdown of the composition of the Tokelau population.\n\nDue to Tokelau’s remoteness and small population, access to services such as education and\nhealthcare are limited. As a result, many of Tokelau’s population frequently travel overseas to\naccess these important services. Because such a large proportion of the Tokelau population is\ntemporarily overseas, we collect information about these usual residents.\n\nFinal counts for 2016\n\nThe three different population counts available from the 2016 Census are outlined below.\n\nDe jure usually resident population\n\nThe de jure usually resident population in 2016 was 1,499. This was a 6.2 percent increase from the\n2011 de jure count, which was 1,411.\n\nThe de jure count was made up of 1,197 usual residents who were present in Tokelau on census\nnight, and 302 usual residents who were overseas.\n\nThe absentee sub-population of 302 includes 48 Tokelauan TPS employees and their immediate\nfamilies based in Apia, and 254 usual Tokelauan residents who were overseas at the time of the\ncensus.\n\nUsually resident population present on census night\n\nThe usually resident population present on census night in 2016 was 1,197. All usual residents had\na census interview, or had one done on their behalf (young children), and therefore this count is\nthe group we have the most information about. Heads of households provided some basic\ninformation about absentees.\n\nThere was a 4.7 percent increase in the usual resident population present on census night from\n\n2011, when the population was 1,143.\n\nCensus night population\n\nThe census night population count in 2016 was 1,285. This figure includes all residents, temporary\nresidents, and visitors present in Tokelau on census night. This is a 6.6 percent increase from 2011,\nwhen 1,205 people were present on census night.\n\nThe census night population count shows how many people are in Tokelau at a point in time every\nfive years.\n\nAbout the population’s structure\nOne-fifth of the population were away on census night\n\nOf the total de jure usually resident population, 20.1 percent were absentees (302 people). The\nabsentee figure includes the TPS employees and their immediate families based in Apia.\n\n15",
    "Page_16": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\nThe proportion of absentees is down from the 2011 and 2006 Censuses. In 2011, 23.4 percent of\nthe de jure usually resident population were absentees, and in 2006 over one-quarter (26.7\npercent) of this count were absent on census night.\n\nAtafu was the atoll with the highest proportion of absentees (23.7 percent), followed by Fakaofo\n(21.1 percent). Nukunonu had the lowest proportion of absentees (14.8 percent). In 2011\nNukunonu was the atoll with the highest proportion of absentees.\n\nAt the national level there were similar proportions of male and female absentees. Of the total\nmale population, 20.5 percent were absent on census night, compared with 19.8 percent of\nfemales.\n\nRatio of male to female absentees on each atoll\n\nLooking at the de jure usually resident population for each atoll (table 4.1), the ratio of males to\nfemales for each atoll varies. Atafu had 94 males for every 100 females and for Fakaofo the ratio\nwas 88. The ratio was substantially higher for Nukunonu with 127 males for every 100 females.\n\nNationally the ratio of males to females was relatively balanced, at 102 males to 100 females,\nwhich was similar to 2011 where it was 99 males to 100 females.\n\nThese results are similar to those in 2011, when Nukunonu had the highest ratio of males to\nfemales. Nukunonu had exactly the same sex ratio (127 to 100 females) in 2011 and 2016.\n\nTable 4.1\n\n \n\nMen and women present and absent from Tokelau on census night\nBy atoll of usual residence\nFor de jure usually resident population, 2016\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMale Female Total\n\nUsual residence\n\nPresent Absent Present Absent Present Absent\nAtafu 198 53 215 53 413 106\nFakaofo 185 41 214 44 399 85\nNukunonu 218 33 167 30 385 63\nSamoa 0 28 0 20 0 48\nTotal 601 155 596 147 1,197 302\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\n \n\nMost of Tokelau’s people are under 30 years\n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 shows the age-sex distribution of the usually resident population who were present in\nTokelau on census night.

Overall men show a\nsmoother transition between the age groups, with a general decrease as you move to the older\nage groups. The percentage of women in each age group shows less consistency. Some of this is\nexplained by women living longer - significantly more women than men were aged 75+.\n\n16",
    "Page_17": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\nMore detailed analysis of the variability would be an interesting avenue for further analysis. It may\nbe simply a feature of the small population size. Other possible explanations are that more\nwomen leave Tokelau, or there were periods in Tokelau’s history when fewer female babies were\nborn.\n\nThe median age for the usually resident population present in Tokelau on census night was 25\nyears. In 2006 the median age was 22 years and in 2011 it was 24 years.

In\n2006 nearly one-third of Nukunonu’s usual residents were away (32.6 percent); in 2011 this\ndropped to 28.5 percent.\n\nFakaofo had a major increase (107 percent) in absentees from 2011 to 2016. The significant\nchange from 2011 to 2016 indicates how much the absentee population fluctuates - something to\nbe aware of when making comparisons between censuses.\n\nDespite an absentee increase in Fakaofo, compared with 2011 the total proportion of absentees in\nTokelau decreased slightly (from 23.4 percent in 2011 to 20.1 percent in 2016).\n\nThe 48 absentees in Samoa on census day were Tokelauan TPS employees and their immediate\nfamilies (all are part of the de jure usually resident population of Tokelau).\n\nNote: the census is a measure of the population at a point in time every five years.

The shapes have broad\nbases then narrow from age 30 years. However, to some extent we can see birth cohorts moving\n\nthrough. There appears to be a relatively large cohort aged 35 to 59 years in 2016.\n\nThere are differences. The proportion of 5-9-year-olds increased between the 2011 and 2016\nCensuses, particularly for males. In contrast, the proportion of 10-14-year-olds fell.\n\nFor the 25-29 and 30-34-year age groups, the shape widens in 2016.\n\nWe also see changes in the sex distribution in figure 4.5. In 2016 males and females had even\nproportions in the 0-24 age groups; in 2011 the proportions varied. In 2016 there was more\nvariability in all age groups from 35 years than in 2011.\n\nThe changes could be due to many factors. Birth rate is mainly responsible for change in the 0-4\nage group, whereas migration is likely to be the main reason behind changes in the middle age\ngroups (25-59 years).\n\nBy comparing one age group in 2016 with the age group five years younger in the 2011 Census, we\nare able to identify some of the population movements.\n\nTokelau’s birth rate lower than Samoa’s\n\nWe asked women (15 years and over) how many children they had ever given birth to and the date\ntheir youngest child was born. This provides useful information about the fertility patterns of\nTokelau.\n\nFigure 4.6 shows the average number of children born, by the mother’s age group. The 65+ age\ngroup had the highest average number of children (5.0) in 2016, although this was down from 2011\n(6.3 births).

This means that for every 1,000 people\nin Tokelau, 19.4 babies are born each year. The crude birth rate uses the de jure usually resident\npopulation, so it includes absentees.\n\nIn 2011, the crude birth rate for the de jure usually resident population was 18.4. The change is\nreflected in the 6.2 percent growth of the total population between 2011 and 2006.\n\nTokelau’s 2016 crude birth rate is higher than the rate for New Zealand (13.3 per 1,000), but lower\nthan Samoa’s (26.0 per 1,000) (United Nations, nd,a).\n\nNote: birth and fertility data must be used with caution. In Tokelau it is common for children to be\nraised by people who are not their birth parents. These children are typically considered to be the\nchildren of the people who raise them. While we aimed to ensure we collected only information\nabout birth children, the Tokelau National Statistics Office and Stats NZ cannot guarantee the\nquality of this data.\n\nMothers tend to live longer than fathers\n\nWe asked adults (15 years and older) whether their birth mother and father were still alive.

Eleven people in Tokelau spoke five languages. Across the three atolls, almost 10\npercentage points separated the atolls with the highest and lowest proportions of multi-lingual\nresidents. On Nukunonu, 57.2 percent of residents spoke two or more languages, while on Atafu\n47.5 percent of the population could do so.

The ability to speak two or more\nlanguages also varied significantly by age. More than three-quarters (75.4 percent) of the 50-54-\nyear-old group in Tokelau spoke two or more languages in 2016. Understandably, only 14.4\npercent of children aged four and under spoke more than one language.\n\nEthnicity\n\nIn the 2016 Tokelau Census, we asked respondents to identify their ethnicity.

This compares with just 4.2 percent of those who did not identify as Tokelauan. The\ncomparatively high rates of Tokelauan ethnicity for people born there suggests that ethnicity and\nnationality are intrinsically tied together in Tokelau.

Figure 5.3 shows the proportion of each age group identifying as\nTokelauan or part-Tokelauan (Tokelauan and one other ethnicity) or as other ethnicities.\n\nIn the 2006 Census, we recorded ethnicity slightly differently from later censuses. People were\nasked to give only one answer for their ethnicity, but could then select multiple ethnicities (eg by\nreporting themselves as part Tokelauan/Samoan).The categories we use in figure 5.3 allow\ncomparisons back to 2006.\n\nFigure 5.3 shows that older groups have greater proportions identifying as being of full-Tokelauan\nethnicity. Younger age groups have greater proportions identifying as either part-Tokelauan or\nother ethnicities.\n\nIn the youngest age group (0-9 years) 59.4 percent of the group identified as full-Tokelauan. In\ncontrast, in the oldest age group (70+ years) 82.8 percent identified as full-Tokelauan.\n\nWhile the proportion of each group identifying as full-Tokelauan generally increases from the\nyoungest to the oldest age group, people aged 30-39 years had the lowest proportion of full-\nTokelauans (50.0 percent).\n\nFigure 5.3\n\nEthnicity of Tokelau residents\"\nBy age group\n2016\nPercent\n90\nTokelauan #Part-Tokelauan Other ethnicities\n80\n\n70\n\n°\n\n10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-4 60-69\nAge group (years)\n\n1.

Most people in Tokelau are\nChristian, and to reflect this, the census questionnaire included three major denominations as\noptions - Congregational Christian, Roman Catholic, and Presbyterian - along with an ‘other,\nplease specify’, option.\n\nFigure 5.4 shows the two main denominations were Congregational Christian and Roman Catholic.\nThere is a significant difference across the three atolls.

The proportions fell from 95.4 percent (2006)\nto 89.8 percent (2011) on Atafu, and from 70.7 percent (2006) to 68.9 percent (2011) on Fakaofo.\n\nOn Nukunonu, there has been a continuing decline in the proportion identifying as Roman\nCatholic - 81.8 percent was down from 93.9 percent in 2006 and 96.9 percent in 2006.\n\nIn contrast, the proportion of people on Fakaofo identifying as Roman Catholic has been rising, up\nto 32.6 percent in 2016, from 25.9 percent in 2011, and 22.2 percent in 2006.\n\nPresbyterian was the third most-common denomination overall (4.2 percent), although on\nFakaofo (2.8 percent) and Nukunonu (6.2 percent), ‘other Christian’ was more common.\n\nFigure 5.4\nReligious affiliation of Tokelau residents\")\nBy atoll\nPercent 2016\n100\n\nAtafu. mFakaofo ™Nukunonu\n\n \n\nCongregational Christian Presbyterian Roman Catholic Other Christian\nDenomination\n\n‘ly For usually resident population present in Tokelau on census night\nSource: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\n28",

    "Page_30": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\n6 Education\n\nAn education system is key in developing a country and its people. The level and duration of\neducation provided for the population are primary determinants of a nation’s skill level. This\nchapter examines the level of education of Tokelau's usual residents, and how this differs by sex,\nage group, occupation, and atoll.\n\nEducation in Tokelau\n\nSecular education began in Tokelau in the early 1950s, after the Tokelau Act 1948 was passed. By\nthe early 1960s, scholarships were available for students to allow them to further their education\nin New Zealand.\n\nToday, Tokelau has a free, compulsory education system for primary and secondary students up\nto 16 years. A distance learning foundation course run by the University of the South Pacific is\navailable in Tokelau via satellite for students who want to prepare for tertiary study. A scholarship\nscheme also offers some students the chance to undertake tertiary study abroad.\n\nAt the time of the 2016 Tokelau Census, 6.9 percent of usual residents aged 15+ and present in\nTokelau (54 students) were still at school. Almost half of all residents (44.5 percent) said the last\nschool they attended was a Tokelau village school, 15.6 percent had last attended secondary\nschool in Samoa, and 14.2 percent had been at secondary school in New Zealand.\n\nThe 6.9 percent still at school was a drop from 10.6 percent in 2011, while the 15.6 percent whose\nlast school was a Samoan secondary school in 2016 was down from 19.9 percent in 2011. This may\nreflect in part the ageing of the population. The proportion who had attended secondary school in\nNew Zealand (14.2 percent) was up slightly from 13.6 percent in 2011.\n\nOlder people less likely to have school qualifications\n\nNote: In the 2016 Census, we collected qualifications gained after leaving school for TPS\nemployees based in Samoa. We didn’t ask for ‘highest qualification gained while at school’. Where\nfigures include TPS employees in Samoa, we say this.\n\nAround two-thirds of Tokelau’s resident adult population (69.1 percent) had a school qualification.\nThe development of Tokelau's education system is evident in figure 6.1, which shows age\ndifferences in the proportion of usual residents aged 15+ who had no qualification.\n\nFigure 6.1 shows that three in four residents aged under 55 years (75.4 percent) had a school\nqualification, compared with only half (49.2 percent) of the 55+ group. People aged 75+ had the\nlowest proportion with a school qualification (32.4 percent).\n\nThe proportion of Tokelau adults with a school qualification increased markedly from 2011, up\nfrom 53.3 percent to 69.1 percent in 2016.\n\nWe made some changes to the education categories in 2016, including New Zealand\nqualifications. However most people under 25 years with school qualifications held non-New\nZealand certificates, which suggests a real rise in the proportion of young people gaining a school\nqualification since 2011 (up from 42.7 percent to 69.1 percent in 2016).\n\nAs in the 2011 Census, males were more likely to have a school qualification than females,\nalthough in 2016 the gender gap had narrowed from 5 percentage points down to less than 2.\n\n30",
    "Page_31": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\nIn 2016, 29.6 percent of males aged 15+ had no qualification, compared with 31.3 percent of\nfemales.

School qualifications are gained at either primary or secondary school (see figure 6.4\nfor more information).\n\nFigure 6.2 also shows that males were more likely than females to hold a trade certificate (8.8\npercent and 5.1 percent for females), while females were more likely to have a degree-level\nqualification (bachelor’s or postgraduate). The proportion of females still studying at tertiary level\nwas also higher than for males (7.9 percent and 3.1 percent).\n\nOf all Tokelauan adult residents present on census night, 45.1 percent were either currently\nstudying or had studied at tertiary level, which was higher than in 2011 (36.8 percent).\n\n31",

This is evident in the United\nNations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Goal three of the SDGs is to “ensure healthy lives\nand promote well-being for all at all ages” (United Nations, nd,b).\n\nMeasuring quality of life has been an area of interest for some time in Tokelau. Due to its\nremoteness, scarce resources, and small population size, economic development is constrained.\nAlthough there are challenges to living in Tokelau, there are the advantages of close family and\ncommunity ties. Collecting subjective measures gives a more-rounded perspective of living in\nTokelau, and complements the objective measures such as income and education.\n\nHow we assess quality of life\n\nThere are many different aspects to the quality of life topic. In the census, we asked about overall\nlife satisfaction, self-assessed health, social connectedness, sense of belonging, and income\nadequacy (explained in more detail below). Most of these are asked about in the New Zealand\nGeneral Social Survey, so we can make comparisons between New Zealand and Tokelau.\n\nKey stakeholders noted that collecting this information will help target policies to improve the\noverall well-being of Tokelau’s people.\n\nMost people rate life satisfaction 10 out of 10\n\nWe asked residents 15+ years to rate their overall life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 was\ncompletely dissatisfied and 10 was completely satisfied. This scale is used internationally, which\nmeans we can make international comparisons, and is the most important and widely used\nmeasure of well-being.\n\nFigure 7.1 shows the distribution of people’s self-reported life satisfaction in Tokelau. Overall,\npeople reported very high levels of life satisfaction. Almost three-quarters of residents (71.3\npercent) rated it at 8 or higher; only 2.5 percent gave a rating of 4 or lower.\n\nThe most-common response by a considerable margin was 10 (49.9 percent). The next most-\ncommon response was 8 (36.1 percent). These results indicate that the majority of people were\nsatisfied with their lives in Tokelau.\n\n39",

Atafu had the greatest proportion rating their life satisfaction at 8 or higher (75.5 percent)\nand the lowest proportion rating it at 4 or below (1.8 percent).\n\nLife satisfaction increases with age\n\nFigure 7.2 shows life satisfaction for each age group, with ratings generally being higher for the\nolder age groups. The 65+ age group had the highest proportion of people who rated their life\nsatisfaction as 10 (64.9 percent). In contrast, for people aged 25-44 years only 42.7 percent gave a\nrating of 10.\n\nThe proportions rating life satisfaction at 8 or higher were: 66.3 percent for the 15-24 age group,\n68.0 percent for those aged 25-44, 75.4 percent for the 45-64 age group, and 81.9 percent for\npeople aged 65+.\n\nFor all age groups similar proportions (all under 5 percent) rated their life satisfaction at 4 or\nlower.\n\nWhen we break down life satisfaction by five-year age groups we find no one aged 70-74 years\ngave a rating of less than 7.

Only 17.8 percent of people in New Zealand rated their life satisfaction as 10,\ncompared with 49.9 percent for people in Tokelau. In addition, 63.3 percent of people in New\nZealand gave a rating of 8 or higher whereas in Tokelau this was 71.3 percent.\n\nThe increase in life satisfaction across the age groups was similar for New Zealand and Tokelau.\n\nNote: the 2016 Tokelau Census was the first time the quality-of-life questions were asked.\nTherefore, we don’t have a time series to observe these variables across time. Neither can we infer\nif older people are more satisfied with their lives as a result of being older, nor whether higher\nquality of life is a feature of these cohorts.\n\nSelf-assessed health\n\nHealth is an important part of people’s well-being and is likely to be a contributor to overall life\nsatisfaction. New Zealand’s GSS asks people to self-assess their health as do other\n\nIn Tokelau, we asked people aged 15+ years to rate their health on a five-point scale. The scale\nconsisted of the categories: poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent.\n\n41",

For each atoll, less than 3 percent of residents\nrated their health as ‘poor’.\n\nThe results were also similar for men and women. Less than 2 percentage points separated the\nsexes for three of the categories (very good, good, and poor). The proportion of men who rated\ntheir health as ‘excellent’ (18.0 percent) was greater than that of women (14.8 percent), which is\ninteresting as the age-sex distribution shows women live longer. On the other hand, more women\n(22.7 percent) than men (17.5 percent) rated their health as ‘fair’.\n\nSelf-assessed health affects life satisfaction ratings\n\nFigure 7.4 gives the breakdown of life satisfaction by self-assessed health rating. Generally as\npeople’s health rating improves so too does their life satisfaction. This relationship is most evident\nfor those rating their life satisfaction as 10. The proportion of people with a rating of 10 increased\nfrom 42.5 percent for those assessing their health as poor or fair, to 61.8 percent for people who\nthought their health was excellent.\n\nPeople with a poor or fair health rating had the highest proportion rating their life satisfaction at 4\nor lower (7.5 percent). Life satisfaction ratings of 5-9 were similar for all five health categories.\n\nWe see a relationship between how healthy people feel and their level of life satisfaction in\nTokelau. It demonstrates how important access to health care and improving people’s health is to\npeople’s overall quality of life.\n\n42",

As for life\nsatisfaction, they rated this on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 indicated no sense of belonging and 10 was\na strong sense of belonging.\n\nWe collected this information to get an indication about whether people enjoyed the strong\ncommunity relations that exist in Tokelau.

    "Page_58": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\n9 Dwellings and households\n\nIn the 2016 Tokelau Census, the head of the household was asked questions about the dwelling\nand members of the household. This chapter focuses on the results from these questions relating\nto private occupied dwellings - the majority of dwellings in Tokelau - and the households that\noccupy them.\n\nThis chapter provides information on the conditions in which Tokelauans live and the level of\nincome across the three atolls. This information in this section can be used to inform housing\npolicy decisions and plan for Tokelau’s future resource requirements.\n\nFor the first time a measure of household income adequacy has been included in the census. This\nwas done to indicate to policy makers how Tokelauan households were dealing with meeting their\neveryday needs with their current level of income.\n\nInformation we collected about dwellings and households\n\nThe 2016 Tokelau Census of Populations and Dwellings collected information on:\n\ne main dwelling facilities\n\ne age of the main dwelling\n\ne items owned by the household\n\ne the household’s collective income\n\ne the household’s income adequacy\n\ne access to the internet and Sky television.\n\nIn Tokelau, it is not uncommon for extended families to live in sub-dwellings surrounding a main\ndwelling. The nature of the household’s structure can pose a challenge in collecting and analysing\ndefinitive household statistics for Tokelau.\n\nThe 2016 Tokelau Census only collected information relating to the main dwelling. Respondents\nwere explicitly asked to only include things pertaining to the main dwelling. By only collecting\nstatistics relating to the main dwelling, we are able to maintain comparability with international\nstandards.\n\nThe census defines the main dwelling as the structure that usually, but not always, contains the\nhousehold’s cooking, washing, or living facilities, and is the building in which most household\nactivity takes place.\n\nThe 2016 Census collected information on private and non-private occupied main dwellings.\nOccupied dwellings are those that are currently in use, and usually have someone living or\nsleeping in them. A private dwelling is one where an individual or family lives, and which is not\navailable for public use. A non-private dwelling is one where occupants are generally not related,\nand in which people stay temporarily; for example a hospital, boat, or guest house.\n\nThe census did not collect information on unoccupied dwellings.\n\nNo information on the three types of houses in Tokelau\n\nUnlike previous censuses, the 2016 Tokelau Census did not collect the type of housing - Tokelauan\nfale, European style house, and mixed housing - in Tokelau. This is because the housing stock in\nTokelau has become relatively homogenised, with most houses being a European style house, as a\nresult of a housing scheme established in the 1980s by the New Zealand Government that allows\n\n58",

There was little change between the 2006 and 2011 Censuses in the proportion of houses\nin each of the three categories.\n\nRooms have many uses\n\nHouseholds were asked how many rooms their main dwelling had. Most dwellings in Tokelau have\nonly one or two rooms with most household activities taking place in these rooms. As these rooms\nare used for multiple purposes, they need to be counted for each use. For example, if a room was\nused as a living room and a bedroom, households were asked to count this as two rooms.\n\nCounting rooms based on their uses was an attempt to ensure a meaningful definition of a room\nfor the analysis, and to allow for meaningful comparison with other nations.\n\nFigure 9.1 shows a substantial variation in the number of rooms per private dwelling across the\nthree atolls. In Atafu, the most common number of rooms is one (44.8 percent of private occupied\ndwellings), where it is common for the living space to be in one dwelling, and then sleeping,\ncooking, etc to be in other sub-dwellings. In Nukunonu, five or more rooms was the most common\nnumber of rooms in private dwellings (37.3 percent).\n\n \n\nFigure 9.1\nNumber of rooms per dwelling\nOccupied private dwellings, by atoll\n2016\nRooms\nFive or more Atafu\n=Fakaofo\nm= Nukunonu\nFour\nThree\nTwo\nOne\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nPercent of occupied private dwellings\n\nSource: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\n59",

It was also common to have eight or more\noccupants in a house (14.5 percent). Tokelauan society is based on large networks within\ncommunities. It is not uncommon for large extended families to live in one household, which\ncould explain the high numbers of people living together.\n\nWhile it is common to have large numbers of people living in single dwellings, figure 9.3 also\nshows us that single-occupant dwellings were not rare on census night, with 11.3 percent of\nprivate occupied dwellings having only one occupant.\n\n60",

Since 1980, more\nthan 75 percent (77.2 percent) of houses have been constructed. Only 11.8 percent of the private\nhousing stock was built before 1970.\n\nWater and power\n\nWater source changing over time\n\nTokelau relies entirely on rain water, as the small coral atolls have no ground water. This makes it\nvulnerable to droughts. The significant drought of 2011 affected the population’s water supply.\nThe impact of the drought can be seen in the data collected in the 2011 Census.\n\nIn 2016 there was no such drought. Figure 8.4 shows a much higher proportion of households had\na private water tank as their main water source (94.5 percent) in 2016 than in 2011 (67.1 percent).\nThe proportion of households using a private water tank as their main water source was slightly\nhigher than in 2006 (83.4 percent) when there was also no drought. Significant moves have been\nmade over the last few years to increase the capacity of water tanks for private dwellings, which\nmay explain some of the increase in private water tank use.\n\nFigure 9.4 also compares the proportion of households using other water sources (that is, not a\nprivate or shared water tank).

From our experiences with the New Zealand Census, we\nassume data quality was an issue for the 2016 Tokelau Census. Census interviewers reported to us\nthat some heads of households found it difficult to recall and combine annual income for their\nentire households, and some heads of households were reluctant to divulge the information.\n\nWhile there are potential issues with data quality, income remains a useful measure for Tokelau.\nThe quality issues were consistent across the three atolls.\n\nMedian income $17,500\n\nThe median income for all households in Tokelau was $17,500 (the mid-way point of the median\nbracket, $15,001-$20,000). This was consistent across each of the three atolls. The consistent\nmedian indicated a relatively even distribution of income across the three atolls.\n\nFigure 9.11 shows a relatively normal distribution of household income in Tokelau, centred on the\n$15,001-$20,000 bracket.

Although a new data\ncollection method was used for this census, where possible we reused other processes and\nmethods from the 2006 and 2011 Censuses.\n\nPlanning\n\nWe developed a high-level plan and three stage plans for the 2016 Tokelau Census. The stage\nplans covered the development, operation, and output phases of the census. Detailed census\nplanning ensured good preparation and a fully documented process.\n\nWe reused the majority of the 2011 Census forms, though we had to add a reasonable amount of\nnew content, particularly around the new quality of life topic.\n\nA significant amount of planning and research prior to census day went into preparing for the new\ndata collection method - for the first time ever, tablets were used for collecting the census data.\n\nThe Tokelau National Statistics Office consulted key Tokelauan stakeholders at appropriate times\nduring planning.\n\nThe forms\n\nThe 2016 Census forms were based on the 2011 versions, with the aim to produce time-series\ncomparisons as a priority. Although having consistency over time is a priority, it is also important\nto ensure content remains relevant. As a result, some variables from the household form were\nremoved as there was no need to collect this information any more. For example the source of\nlighting variable was no longer needed as Tokelau recently become nearly 100 percent solar\npowered.\n\nThe main new content was around the quality of life, which has been a topic of interest for some\ntime in Tokelau. This topic included questions on life satisfaction, self-assessed health, income\nadequacy, sense of belonging, and social connectedness.\n\nQuestions around language proficiency and mortality were added as these areas were identified\nas currently having a lack of accurate data.\n\nThe English version of the questionnaire was reviewed by using cognitive testing with Wellington-\nbased Tokelauan families.\n\nWe consulted about the forms in Tokelau and Samoa with Tokelau government representatives\nand decision-makers. This consultation gave us an opportunity to determine what information\nwas required by various data users and how it could best be delivered.\n\nWe developed a questionnaire translation strategy early in the process, to try and ensure there\nwas an improvement on how the translation was carried out for the 2016 Tokelau Census.\n\nThe census form was a tablet-computer-based, interviewer-administered form with questions\navailable in two languages (English and Tokelauan). Answer choices were in English with a\nTokelauan version of the answers available as showcards.\n\n73",
    "Page_74": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\nData collection\n\nData collection was significantly different to all previous Tokelau censuses.\n\nInterviewers used Samsung tablet computers to collect data from each individual. The application\nwe used to collect and store the data was called Survey Solutions, developed by the World Bank.\n\nThe 2016 Tokelau Census was a modified de jure census. A de jure census counts people where\nthey usually reside. The census was done this way to ensure Tokelauan employees of the Tokelau\nPublic Service (TPS), based in Apia, were included in the census count.\n\nA modified de jure census is also used by Statistics Canada - so government employees who are\nstationed overseas are included in the census population count.\n\nPreparing for census day\n\nTo ensure that local people were aware of the census, and its importance, the Tokelau National\nStatistics Office distributed pamphlets with information about the census to the key decision\nmakers on each of the atolls.\n\nThe team also carried out a consultation in Tokelau earlier in 2016. The purpose of this was to\nconsult about the proposed content for the 2016 census and to promote and raise awareness\nabout the census.\n\nIn Tokelau, we recruited people from each atoll to work as district supervisors and interviewers —\nwe had three district supervisors and 29 interviewers in the field.\n\nThe plan was to train the entire field staff on one atoll - Fakaofo. We set aside five days and had\ntraining modules prepared. However, because of the boat schedule having to change for\nunexpected circumstances, the training had to take place on each individual atoll. The core team\ntrained the Fakaofo field staff together; however the Nukunonu and Atafu field staff were trained\nby only one member of the core team on their respective atolls. Due to the training having to be\ndone separately, the training time had to be significantly reduced. Although this was not ideal, the\ncore team ensured that the training was consistent across the three atolls.\n\nThe training sessions, and atoll-based field collection staff, provided ways to gain local\nengagement in the census process.\n\nCensus day process\n\nThe 2016 Tokelau Census took place on Tuesday, 18 October 2016. On that day every person in\nTokelau was interviewed. Tokelauan employees of the TPS based in Apia (and their immediate\nfamilies), were also interviewed in Apia on census day. The census forms and data collection\nmethodologies used in Tokelau and Apia were different - they were altered to meet local\nrequirements.\n\nA person from their own atoll interviewed Tokelau respondents at their homes in Tokelau. The\nhead of the household completed the household questionnaire and the individual questionnaires\nwere answered by the individual or by the head of the household in the case of young children.\nEach household nominated their own head of household.\n\nIn this census, because of the new quality of life questions, it was particularly important that each\nindividual answered their own individual questionnaire. As a result of this, it was more challenging\nand took longer than expected to complete all the interviews on census day.\n\n74",
    "Page_75": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\nTwo members of the Tokelau National Statistics Office were responsible for carrying out the\ncollections process at the TPS office in Apia. We completed interviewer training in one day, and\ninterviews were completed at the Apia TPS office on census day. The TPS employee was asked\nabout each member of their immediate family. We used a shorter version of the full individual\nquestionnaire, which consisted of only basic demographic questions about each member of the\nhousehold. No dwelling questions were asked in Samoa.\n\nOn each of Tokelau’s atolls, one of the census management team oversaw field operations and\nundertook quality monitoring on census day.\n\nChecking after census day\n\nThanks to the new data collection method, it was possible to quality check census forms on\ncensus day as soon as the interviewers uploaded them. Supervisors helped the census\nmanagement team to quality check every census form and if there were missing answers or errors\nfound, the forms were sent back to the interviewers to fix. The ability to check the quality of\nanswers was one of the major benefits of using tablets for data collection; it made the checking\nprocess faster and more thorough. This checking also ensured that the final population counts\nwere able to be released only three weeks after census.\n\nIdentification numbers and household lists\n\nWe used basic maps and the supervisors’ local knowledge to help come up with a list of\nhouseholds for each atoll. This was then used to allocate households to each interviewer. This\nhousehold list was used by the supervisor on census day to check that no households had been\nmissed. Each interviewer had a list of 9 or 10 households and was given an identification number\nfor each of these households. Each time they started a household they were required to put in this\nidentification number.\n\nThe census management team noted that this system was very successful.\n\nClassifications\n\nThe classifications used for the answers were based on the 2006 and 2011 Tokelau Censuses, with\na few minor tweaks. The majority of the classifications were based on the tick-box options from\neach question on the form.\n\nThanks to tablets being used, we were able to reduce the number of questions with open-ended\nresponses. For those questions that did allow for open-ended responses, such as occupation, we\nbuilt code files. A coding dictionary was created for all of the questions from the household form\nand the individual form.\n\nWherever possible, we based the classifications on New Zealand standard classifications. Often\nthese classifications have multiple levels of detail, where the most-detailed level covers all the\ncountries or religions in the world and the least-detailed level covers the main groups or areas.\n\nClassifications were tailored for the Tokelau situation. Knowledge of and experience in Tokelau\nsuggested some categories would be likely responses to the questions, while others were unlikely.\nWe included the unlikely categories only to ensure exhaustive classifications.\n\n75",

We sought to determine first of all what content people needed to be\ncollected and what ouputs they would like to see us produce. We also invited the New Zealand\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide comment and they provided some useful\nfeedback. The approach to produce the same outputs as 2011 was agreed on and the respective\noutput products were produced and released.\n\nThe following census data releases have been completed, and are available on\nwww.tokelau.org.nz:\ne 11 November 2016 - Final population counts: 2016 Tokelau Census\ne 1 February 2017 - 2016 Tokelau Census tables (for demography, economic activity,\nmigration, education, social profile, dwellings and households, and quality of life)\ne 13 March 2017 - 2016 Tokelau Census atoll profiles (for Atafu, Fakaofo, and Nukunonu)\ne 2May 2017 - Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings.\n\nConfidentiality rules\n\nTo offer a degree of confidentiality protection, and to ensure that Tokelau census tables are of\ngood quality, we used a confidentiality calculation to control the size of tables produced for the\ncensus outputs.\n\nThe confidentiality rule, called the ‘mean cell size rule’, states there must be on average two or\nmore observations per cell before the information for a geographic area can be released. For the\n2016 Tokelau Census there are three output geographies: national, atoll, and village. The smallest\ngeography is village. The main purpose of these rules is to prevent tables from becoming sparse\n(that is, with many cells containing zeros and ones).\n\n79",

For clarity, this appendix defines\n‘people who usually reside overseas’. No separate population count was produced for this group,\nbut understanding its definition provides background to the usual residence criteria.\n\nIt is important to note that usual residence in the context of this census is not a legal definition of\nresidence, nor of immigration status. It is a statistical definition used to frame and measure\npopulations. The Tokelau language does not easily make this distinction.\n\nA. Usually resident population for the 2016 Tokelau Census of\nPopulation and Dwellings criteria\n\nA.1. People normally living in Tokelau and present in Tokelau on census night regardless of their:\ne immigration status\ne ethnicity\ne country of birth.\n\nA.2. Respondents must have lived in Tokelau for three months or more.\n\nAtime criterion applies when a respondent comes from another country. To be usually resident in\nTokelau, the respondent must have been residing there for three months or more.\n\nIf the respondent has not resided in Tokelau for three months or more, they are required to give\nthe address of the country they have recently come from.\n\nThis is consistent with statistical concepts of long-term migration and enables counts of a ‘stable’\npopulation over time.\n\nHowever, where a respondent has lived in Tokelau for more than three months, and moves from\none village (Village A) to another (Village B) within Tokelau, the following applies.\ne = If they have lived in Village B for less than three months, they are a ‘usual resident’ of the\nvillage they recently moved from (Village A).\ne = If they have lived in Village B for three months or more, they are a ‘usual resident’ of their\n‘new’ village (Village B).\n\nA.3. People normally living in Tokelau who are absent on census night.\n\nThese people are counted as part of the usually resident population if they are absent for less than\n12 months in total. This includes people who are absent because they are:\ne students who live outside Tokelau to attend secondary school (eg education scholarship\nsystem students)\ne people who normally live in Tokelau but who are travelling on official duties\ne people who are away from Tokelau for medical treatment as:\n\no medical patients under the health referral scheme or privately funded\n\no family member (s), caregiver(s), or guardian(s) accompanying patients overseas\nto get medical treatment\n\n81",
    "Page_82": "Profile of Tokelau: 2016 Tokelau Census of Population and Dwellings\n\ne people visiting other countries who are away for less than 12 months.\n\nA.4. Tokelauan Tokelau Public Service (TPS) employees based in Apia, Samoa, and any immediate\nfamily who usually live in their households.\n\nThe definition of ‘Tokelauan’ is based on TPS employees who identify their ethnicity as Tokelauan.\n‘Any immediate family members who usually live in the employee’s household’ includes the TPS\nemployee’s spouse/partner and children, regardless of:\n\ne their ethnicity\n\ne whether they have ever lived in Tokelau.\n\nImmediate family who were away from the dwelling on the night of Tuesday, 18 October 2016 are\nstill counted - as long as they usually live at the same household as the TPS employee completing\nthe form.\n\nA.5. The usually resident count excludes:\n\ne temporary visitors to Tokelau who indicated in the census that their usual residence is\noverseas\n\ne people who are not from Tokelau and who work at the national TPS office in Apia, Samoa\n\ne people who usually live in Tokelau but who are away for 12 months or more and are not\ncovered by A.2.\n\nNote: People who are travelling overseas for 12 months or more for personal reasons, and who are\nlegal residents of Tokelau from an immigration or citizenship perspective, are not counted as\nstatistical usual residents.\n\nB. Census night population for the 2016 Tokelau Census of\nPopulation and Dwellings criteria\n\nB.1. All people in Tokelau on census night.\n\nB.2. Census night population count includes:\n\ne temporary visitors to Tokelau\ne people travelling between Samoa and Tokelau, if they are in Tokelauan international\nwaters.\n\nB.3. Census night population count excludes:\n\ne people normally living in Tokelau who are absent on census night.\n\nC. People who usually reside overseas criteria\n\nC.1. People who gave an overseas location as their usual residence in question 5 (ie visitors).\nC.2. People who live overseas who plan to migrate or return permanently to Tokelau in the future.\nC.3. People from Tokelau who have moved overseas to live.\n\nC.4. People who are not from Tokelau and who work at the national TPS office in Apia, Samoa.\n\n82",
