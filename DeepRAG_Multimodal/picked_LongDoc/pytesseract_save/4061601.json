    "Page_1": "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) included in this Annual Report are the\nresponsibility of the management of TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL or the Company) and have been approved by the Board\nof Directors of the Company. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with\nUnited States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include amounts that are based on estimates and judgments.\nThe MD8A is based on the Company's financial results. It compares the Company's financial and operating performance in 2016\nto that in 2015, and highlights significant changes between 2015 and 2014. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Financial information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report is\nconsistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.\nManagement has designed and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting, including a program of internal\naudits to carry out its responsibility. Management believes these controls provide reasonable assurance that financial records are\nreliable and form a proper basis for the preparation of financial statements. The internal control over financial reporting include\nmanagement's communication to employees of policies that govern ethical business conduct.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,\nmanagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework\nin Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO). Management concluded, based on its evaluation, that internal control over financial reporting was effective\nas of December 31, 2016, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external reporting purposes.\n\nTCPL acquired Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. (Columbia) on July 1, 2016. As a result, management's assessment and conclusion on\nthe effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting did not include internal controls over financial reporting at\nColumbia. These exclusions are consistent with SEC Commission Staff's guidance that the assessment of a recently acquired\nbusiness may be omitted from the scope of its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the\nyear of the acquisition. Assets attributable to Columbia represented approximately 13 per cent of TCPL's total assets as at\nDecember 31, 2016, and revenues attributable to Columbia for the period July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 represented\napproximately 7 per cent of TCPL's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements and MD&A and ensuring that\nmanagement fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and internal control. The Board of Directors carries out these\nresponsibilities primarily through the Audit Committee, which consists of independent, non-management directors. The Audit\nCommittee meets with management at least five times a year and meets independently with internal and external auditors and as\na group to review any significant accounting, internal control and auditing matters in accordance with the terms of the Charter of\nthe Audit Committee, which is set out in the Annual Information Form. The Audit Committee's responsibilities include overseeing\nmanagement's performance in carrying out its financial reporting responsibilities and reviewing the Annual Report, including the\nconsolidated financial statements and MD&A, before these documents are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. The\ninternal and independent external auditors have access to the Audit Committee without the requirement to obtain prior\nmanagement approval.\n\nThe Audit Committee approves the terms of engagement of the independent external auditors and reviews the annual audit plan,\nthe Auditors’ Report and the results of the audit. It also recommends to the Board of Directors the firm of external auditors to be\nappointed by the shareholder.\n\nThe shareholder has appointed KPMG LLP as independent external auditors to express an opinion as to whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows in accordance with GAAP. The report of KPMG LLP outlines the scope of its examination and its opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nRussell K. Girling Donald R.

We conducted our\naudits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical\nrequirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements\nare free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal\ncontrol relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nentity's internal control.

    "Page_8": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nDESCRIPTION OF TCPL'S BUSINESS\n\nTransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL or the Company) is a leading North American energy infrastructure company which operates\nin three core businesses, Natural Gas Pipelines, Liquids Pipelines and Energy, each of which offers different products and services.\nAs a result of the acquisition of Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. (Columbia) and the pending monetization of the United States (U.S.)\nNortheast power business, the Company has revised its reporting segments from Natural Gas Pipelines, Liquids Pipelines, Energy\nand Corporate, to Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines, U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines, Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines, Liquids Pipelines,\nEnergy and Corporate as at December 31, 2016. The Corporate segment is non-operational, consisting of corporate and\nadministrative functions. The revised structure aligns with the information reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker\n(CODM). Historical financial results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 have been adjusted to align with this change\nin the Company's segmented reporting. The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransCanada Corporation (TransCanada).\n\nCanadian Natural Gas Pipelines\nThe Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines segment consists of the Company's investments in 40,111 km (24,923 miles) of regulated\nnatural gas pipelines.\n\nU.S. Natural Gas Pipelines\nThe U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines segment consists of the Company's investments in 49,776 km (30,933 miles) of regulated natural\ngas pipelines, 535 Bcf of regulated natural gas storage facilities, midstream and other assets.\n\nAcquired as part of Columbia on July 1, 2016, the Company owns and operates:\n\n¢ Columbia Gas — an interstate natural gas transportation pipeline and storage system, which has largely operated as a means\nto transport gas from the Gulf Coast, via Columbia Gulf, from various pipeline interconnects and from production areas in the\nAppalachian region to markets in the midwest, Atlantic, and northeast regions.\n\n¢ Columbia Gulf - a long-haul interstate natural gas transportation pipeline system that was originally designed to transport\nsupply from the Gulf of Mexico to major supply markets in the U.S. Northeast. The pipeline is now transitioning and\nexpanding to accommodate new supply from the Appalachian basin at its interconnect with Columbia Gas and other pipelines\nto deliver natural gas across various Gulf Coast markets.\n\n¢ — Millennium — a 47.5 per cent ownership interest in Millennium Pipeline, which transports natural gas primarily sourced from\nthe Marcellus shale to markets across southern New York and the lower Hudson Valley, as well as to New York City through\nits pipeline interconnections.\n\n¢ — Crossroads — an interstate natural gas pipeline operating in Indiana and Ohio.\n\ne Midstream — this business provides natural gas producer services including gathering, treating, conditioning, processing,\ncompression and liquids handling in the Appalachian Basin, and includes a 47 per cent interest in Pennant Midstream.\n\nMexico Natural Gas Pipelines\n\nThe Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines segment consists of the Company's investments in 1,617 km (1,005 miles) of regulated natural\ngas pipelines in Mexico. This segment also includes the Company's 46.5 percent interest in the TransGas pipeline located in\nColombia and prior to its sale in November 2014, the Company's interest in Gas Pacifico/INNERGY in South America.\n\nLiquids Pipelines\nThe Liquids Pipelines segment consists of the Company's investment in 4,324 km (2,687 miles) of crude oil pipeline systems which\nconnect Alberta and U.S. crude oil supplies to U.S. refining markets in Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe Energy segment primarily consists of the Company's investments in 18 power generation plants and 118 Bcf of non-regulated\nnatural gas storage facilities. These include Canadian plants in Alberta, Ontario, Québec and New Brunswick, and U.S. plants in\nNew York, New England, Pennsylvania and Arizona. At December 31, 2016, five power generation plants in New York and New\nEngland, Pennsylvania are classified as Assets held for sale.

    "Page_9": "ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP). Amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TCPL and its subsidiaries. The Company consolidates its interest in\nentities over which it is able to exercise control. To the extent there are interests owned by other parties, these interests are\nincluded in Non-controlling interests. TCPL uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures in which the Company is able\nto exercise joint control and for investments in which the Company is able to exercise significant influence. TCPL records its\nproportionate share of undivided interests in certain assets. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to\ncurrent year presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates and Judgments\n\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, TCPL is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the\namount and timing of recording assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses since the determination of these items may be dependent\non future events. The Company uses the most current information available and exercises careful judgment in making these\nestimates and assumptions. Significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n\ne — fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination (Note 5)\n\ne — fair value and depreciation rates of plant, property and equipment (Note 8)\n\n¢ carrying value of regulatory assets and liabilities (Note 10)\n\ne — fair value of goodwill (Note 11)\n\ne — fair value of intangible assets (Note 12)\n\n¢ carrying value of asset retirement obligations (Note 15)\n\n¢ provisions for income taxes (Note 16)\n\n¢ assumptions used to measure retirement and other post-retirement obligations (Note 23)\n\ne fair value of financial instruments (Note 24) and\n\n¢ provision for commitments, contingencies, guarantees (Note 27) and restructuring (Note 28).\n\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nRegulation\n\nIn Canada, regulated natural gas pipelines and liquids pipelines are subject to the authority of the National Energy Board (NEB). In\nthe U.S., natural gas pipelines, liquids pipelines and regulated natural gas storage assets are subject to the authority of the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In Mexico, natural gas pipelines are subject to the authority of the Energy Regulatory\nCommission (CRE). The Company's Canadian, U.S. and Mexican natural gas transmission operations are regulated with respect to\nconstruction, operations and the determination of tolls. Rate-regulated accounting (RRA) standards may impact the timing of the\nrecognition of certain revenues and expenses in TCPL's rate-regulated businesses which may differ from that otherwise expected in\nnon-rate-regulated businesses to appropriately reflect the economic impact of the regulators’ decisions regarding revenues and\ntolls. TCPL's businesses that apply RRA currently include Canadian, U.S. and Mexican natural gas pipelines, regulated U.S. natural\ngas storage and certain of its liquids pipelines projects. RRA is not applicable to the Keystone Pipeline System as the regulators’\ndecisions regarding operations and tolls on that system generally do not have an impact on timing of recognition of revenues\n\nand expenses.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nNatural Gas Pipelines and Liquids Pipelines\n\nTransportation\n\nRevenues from the Company's natural gas and liquids pipelines, with the exception of Canadian natural gas pipelines which are\nsubject to RRA, are generated from contractual arrangements for committed capacity and from the transportation of natural gas or\ncrude oil. Revenues earned from firm contracted capacity arrangements are recognized ratably over the contract period regardless\nof the amount of natural gas or crude oil that is transported. Transportation revenues for interruptible or volumetric-based services\nare recognized when physical deliveries of natural gas or crude oil are made.\n\nTCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016 116",
    "Page_10": "Revenues from Canadian natural gas pipelines subject to RRA are recognized in accordance with decisions made by the NEB. The\nCompany's Canadian natural gas pipeline tolls are based on revenue requirements designed to recover the costs of providing\nnatural gas transportation services, which include a return of and return on capital, as approved by the NEB. The Company's\nCanadian natural gas pipelines generally are not subject to risks related to variances in revenues and most costs. These variances\nare generally subject to deferral treatment and are recovered or refunded in future rates. The Company's Canadian natural gas\nipelines, at times, are subject to incentive mechanisms, as negotiated with shippers and approved by the NEB. These mechanisms\ncan result in the Company recognizing more or less revenue than required to recover the costs that are subject to incentives.\nRevenues are recognized on firm contracted capacity ratably over the contract period. Revenues from interruptible or volumetric-\nased services are recorded when physical delivery is made. Revenues recognized prior to an NEB decision on rates for that period\nreflect the NEB's last approved rate of return on common equity (ROE) assumptions. Adjustments to revenue are recorded when\nthe NEB decision is received.\n\nhe Company's U.S. natural gas pipelines are subject to FERC regulations and, as a result, revenues collected may be subject to\nrefund during a rate proceeding. Allowances for these potential refunds are recognized using management's best estimate based\non the facts and circumstances of the proceeding. Any allowances that are recognized during the proceeding process are refunded\nor retained at the time a regulatory decision becomes final.\n\nRevenues from the Company's Mexican natural gas pipelines are primarily collected based on CRE-approved negotiated firm\ncapacity contracts and recognized ratably over the contract period. Other volumes shipped on these pipelines are subject to\nCRE-approved tariffs.\n\nhe Company does not take ownership of the gas that it transports for others.\n\nRegulated Natural Gas Storage\n\nRevenues from the Company's regulated natural gas storage services are recognized ratably over the contract period for firm\ncommitted capacity regardless of the amount of natural gas that is stored, and when gas is injected or withdrawn for interruptible\nor volumetric-based services. The Company does not take ownership of the gas that it stores for others.\n\n \n\nMidstream and Other\n\nRevenues from the Company's midstream natural gas services, including gathering, treating, conditioning, processing, compression\nand liquids handling services, are generated from volumetric based contractual arrangements and are recognized ratably over the\ncontract period regardless of the amount of natural gas that is subject to these services. The Company also owns mineral rights in\nassociation with certain storage facilities. These mineral rights can be leased or contributed to producers of natural gas in return for\na royalty interest. Royalties from mineral interests are recognized when product is produced.\n\nEnergy\n\nPower\n\nRevenues from the Company's Energy business are primarily derived from the sale of electricity and from the sale of unutilized\nnatural gas fuel, which are recorded at the time of delivery. Revenues also include capacity payments and ancillary services, as well\nas gains and losses resulting from the use of commodity derivative contracts. The accounting for derivative contracts is described in\nthe Derivative instruments and hedging activities policy in this note.\n\nNon-Regulated Natural Gas Storage\n\nRevenues earned from providing non-regulated natural gas storage services are recognized in accordance with the terms of the\nnatural gas storage contracts, which is generally over the term of the contract. Revenues earned on the sale of proprietary natural\ngas are recorded in the month of delivery. Derivative contracts for the purchase or sale of natural gas are recorded at fair value\nwith changes in fair value recorded in Revenues.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company's Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three\nmonths or less and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\nInventories\nInventories primarily consist of natural gas inventory in storage, crude oil in transit, materials and supplies including spare parts and\nfuel. Inventories are all carried at the lower of weighted average cost or market.\n\n117 TCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016",
    "Page_11": "Plant, Property and Equipment\n\nNatural Gas Pipelines\n\nPlant, property and equipment for natural gas pipelines are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis once\nthe assets are ready for their intended use. Pipeline and compression equipment are depreciated at annual rates ranging from one\nper cent to six per cent, and metering and other plant equipment are depreciated at various rates reflecting their estimated useful\nlives. The cost of major overhauls of equipment is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated service lives of the overhauls. The\ncost of regulated natural gas pipelines includes an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) consisting of a debt\ncomponent and an equity component based on the rate of return on rate base approved by regulators. AFUDC is reflected as an\nincrease in the cost of the assets in plant, property and equipment and the equity component of AFUDC is a non-cash expenditure\nwith a corresponding credit recognized in Allowance for funds used during construction in the Consolidated statement of income.\nInterest is capitalized during construction of non-regulated natural gas pipelines.\n\nNatural gas storage base gas, which is valued at cost, represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate well\npressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. Natural gas storage base gas is not depreciated.\n\nWhen regulated natural gas pipelines retire plant, property and equipment from service, the original book cost is removed from the\ngross plant amount and recorded as a reduction to accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred to remove a plant from service, net\nof any salvage proceeds, are also recorded in accumulated depreciation.\n\nMidstream and Other\n\nant, property and equipment for midstream assets are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis once the\nassets are ready for their intended use. Gathering and processing facilities are depreciated at annual rates ranging from\n\n.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent, and other plant and equipment are depreciated at various rates. When these assets are retired from\nplant, property and equipment, the original book cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are derecognized\nand any gain or loss is recorded in net income.\n\nzu\n\nThe Company participates as a working interest partner in the development of Marcellus and Utica acreage. The working interest\nallows the Company to invest in the drilling activities in addition to a royalty interest in well production. The Company uses the\nsuccessful efforts method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil resulting from its portion of drilling activities. Capitalized well\ncosts are depleted based on the units of production method.\n\nLiquids Pipelines\n\nPlant, property and equipment for liquids pipelines are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis once the\nassets are ready for their intended use. Pipeline and pumping equipment are depreciated at annual rates ranging from two\n\nper cent to 2.5 per cent, and other plant and equipment are depreciated at various rates. The cost of these assets includes interest\ncapitalized during construction for non-regulated liquids pipelines and AFUDC for regulated pipelines. When liquids pipelines retire\nplant, property and equipment from service, the original book cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are\nderecognized and any gain or loss is recorded in net income.\n\n \n\nEnergy\n\nPower generation and natural gas storage plant, equipment and structures are recorded at cost and, once the assets are ready for\ntheir intended use, depreciated by major component on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives at average annual\nrates ranging from two per cent to 20 per cent. Other equipment is depreciated at various rates. The cost of major overhauls of\nequipment is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated service lives of the overhauls. Interest is capitalized on facilities under\nconstruction. When these assets are retired from plant, property and equipment, the original book cost and related accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization are derecognized and any gain or loss is recorded in net income. Natural gas storage base gas,\nwhich is valued at original cost, represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate well pressure exists to\ndeliver current gas inventory. Natural gas storage base gas is not depreciated.\n\nCorporate\nCorporate plant, property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful\nlives at average annual rates ranging from three per cent to 20 per cent.\n\nTCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016 118",
    "Page_12": "Capitalized Project Costs\n\nThe Company capitalizes project costs once advancement to a construction stage is probable or costs are otherwise likely to be\nrecoverable. The Company also capitalizes interest for non-regulated projects in development and AFUDC for regulated projects.\nCapital projects in development are included in Intangible and other assets. These represent larger projects that generally require\nregulatory or other approvals before physical construction can begin. Once approvals are received, projects are moved to Plant,\nproperty and equipment under construction. When the asset is ready for its intended use and available for operations, capitalized\nproject costs are depreciated in accordance with the Company's depreciation policies.\n\nAssets Held For Sale\n\nThe Company classifies assets as held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a\ndisposal group and expects the sale to close within the next twelve months. Upon classifying an asset as held for sale, the asset is\nrecorded at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, reduced for selling costs, and any losses are recognized in\nNet income. Depreciation expense is no longer recorded once assets are classified as held for sale.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nhe Company reviews long-lived assets, such as Plant, property and equipment and Intangible assets for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the total of the estimated undiscounted\nuture cash flows or the estimated sale price is less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the\nexcess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset.\n\nAcquisitions and Goodwill\n\nhe Company accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets and\niabilities of the acquired entities are primarily measured at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the\nair value of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is classified as goodwill. Goodwill\nis not amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat it might be impaired. The annual review for goodwill impairment is performed at the reporting unit level which is one level\nelow the Company's operating segments. The Company initially assesses qualitative factors to determine whether events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. If the Company concludes that it is not more likely than not\nthat the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, the first step of the two-step impairment test is performed\n\n \n\nyy comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit\nis less than its carrying value, an impairment is indicated and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the\nimpairment. In the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the recognized amounts of all tangible\nand intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value determined in the initial assessment. If the carrying value of\ngoodwill exceeds the calculated implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to the\ndifference.\n\nPower Purchase Arrangements\n\nA power purchase arrangement (PPA) is a long-term contract for the purchase or sale of power on a predetermined basis. TCPL has\nPPAs for the sale of power that are accounted for as operating leases. Prior to their termination, substantially all the PPAs under\nwhich TCPL purchased power were also accounted for as operating leases, and initial payments to acquire these PPAs were\nrecognized in Intangible and other assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts. A portion of these\nPPAs were subleased to third parties under terms and conditions similar to the PPAs, and were also accounted for as operating\nleases with the margin earned from the subleases recorded in Revenues. During 2016, the Company terminated these PPAs and\nrecorded an impairment charge. Refer to Note 12, Intangible and other assets, for further information.\n\nRestricted Investments\nhe Company has certain investments that are restricted as to their withdrawal and use. These restricted investments are classified\nas available for sale and are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAs a result of the NEB’s Land Matters Consultation Initiative (LMCI), TCPL is required to collect funds to cover estimated future\nipeline abandonment costs for all NEB regulated Canadian pipelines. Funds collected are placed in trusts that hold and invest the\nunds and are accounted for as restricted investments. LMCI restricted investments may only be used to fund the abandonment of\nthe NEB regulated pipeline facilities; therefore, a corresponding regulatory liability is recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n \n\nhe Company also has other restricted investments that have been set aside to fund insurance claim losses to be paid by the\nCompany's wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary.\n\n119 TCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016",
    "Page_13": "Income Taxes\n\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method requires the recognition of deferred\nincome tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying\namounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured\nusing enacted tax rates at the balance sheet date that are anticipated to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary\ndifferences are expected to be reversed or settled. Changes to these balances are recognized in net income in the period during\nwhich they occur except for changes in balances related to the Canadian regulated natural gas pipelines which are deferred until\nthey are refunded or recovered in tolls, as permitted by the NEB. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-\ncurrent on the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nCanadian income taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of foreign investments that the Company does not intend to\nrepatriate in the foreseeable future.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe Company recognizes the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations (ARO) in the period in which it is incurred,\nwhen a legal obligation exists and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value is added to the carrying amount\nof the associated asset and the liability is accreted through charges to Operating and other expenses.\n\nThe Company has recorded ARO related to its non-regulated natural gas storage operations, mineral rights and certain power\ngeneration facilities. The scope and timing of asset retirements related to most of the Company's natural gas pipelines, liquids\npipelines and hydroelectric power plants is indeterminable. As a result, the Company has not recorded an amount for ARO related\nto these assets, with the exception of certain abandoned facilities and certain facilities expected to be retired as part of an ongoing\nmodernization program that will improve system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility on Columbia Gas.\n\nEnvironmental Liabilities\n\nThe Company records liabilities on an undiscounted basis for environmental remediation efforts that are likely to occur and where\nthe cost can be reasonably estimated. The estimates, including associated legal costs, are based on available information using\nexisting technology and enacted laws and regulations. The estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs\nincurred or new circumstances. Amounts expected to be recovered from other parties, including insurers, are recorded as an asset\nseparate from the associated liability.\n\nEmission allowances or credits purchased for compliance are recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet at historical cost and\nexpensed when they are utilized. Compliance costs are expensed when incurred. Allowances granted to or internally generated by\nTCPL are not attributed a value for accounting purposes. When required, TCPL accrues emission liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheet upon the generation or sale of power using the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation.\nAllowances and credits not used for compliance are sold and any gain or loss is recorded in Revenues.\n\nStock Options and Other Compensation Programs\n\nTransCanada's Stock Option Plan permits options for the purchase of TransCanada common shares to be awarded to certain\nemployees, including officers. Stock options granted are recorded using the fair value method. Under this method, compensation\nexpense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value as calculated using a binomial model and is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the vesting period with an offset to Additional paid-in capital. TCPL records the compensation expense associated\nwith these stock options.\n\nThe Company has medium-term incentive plans, under which payments are made to eligible employees. The expense related to\nthese incentive plans is accounted for on an accrual basis. Under these plans, benefits vest when certain conditions are met,\nincluding the employees’ continued employment during a specified period and achievement of specified corporate performance\ntargets.\n\nEmployee Post-Retirement Benefits\n\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans (DB Plans), defined contribution plans (DC Plans), a savings plan and other\npost-retirement benefit plans. Contributions made by the Company to the DC Plans and savings plan are expensed in the period in\nwhich contributions are made. The cost of the DB Plans and other post-retirement benefits received by employees is actuarially\ndetermined using the projected benefit method pro-rated based on service and management's best estimate of expected plan\ninvestment performance, salary escalation, retirement age of employees and expected health care costs.\n\nTCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016 120",

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional\ncurrency using the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date whereas non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated\nat the historical rate of exchange in effect on the date of the transaction. Exchange gains and losses resulting from translation of\nmonetary assets and liabilities are recorded in Net income except for exchange gains and losses of the foreign currency debt\nrelated to Canadian regulated natural gas pipelines, which are deferred until they are refunded or recovered in tolls, as permitted\nby the NEB.\n\n \n\nGains and losses arising from translation of foreign operations’ functional currencies to the Company's Canadian dollar reporting\ncurrency are reflected in OCI until the operations are sold at which time, the gains and losses are reclassified to Net income. Asset\nand liability accounts are translated at the period-end exchange rates while revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at\nthe exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction. The Company's U.S. dollar-denominated debt and certain derivative\nhedging instruments have been designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries and, as a result, the unrealized\nforeign exchange gains and losses on the U.S. dollar denominated debt are also reflected in OCI.\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value, unless they qualify for and are designated\n\nunder a normal purchase and normal\n\nThe Company applies hedge account\nincludes fair value and cash flow he\n\nsales exemption, or are considered to meet other permitted exemptions.\n\ning to arrangements that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting treatment, which\nges, and hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging relationship ceases to be effective or the hedging or hedged items\n\ncease to exist as a result of maturity,\n\nIn a fair value hedging relationship, t\n\nexpiry, sale, termination, cancellation or exercise.\n\ne carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the\n\nhedged risk and these changes are recognized in Net income.

The fair value of these guarantees is estimated by discounting the cash flows that\nwould be incurred by the Company if letters of credit were used in place of the guarantees as appropriate in the circumstances.\nGuarantees are recorded as an increase to Equity investments, Plant, property and equipment, or a charge to Net income, and a\ncorresponding liability is recorded in Other long-term liabilities. The release from the obligation is recognized either over the term\nof the guarantee or upon expiration or settlement.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nChanges in Accounting Policies for 2016\n\nExtraordinary and unusual income statement items\n\nIn January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance on extraordinary and unusual income\nstatement items. This update eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP. This new guidance was effective\nJanuary 1, 2016, was applied prospectively and did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nConsolidation\n\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on consolidation. This guidance requires that entities re-evaluate whether they\nshould consolidate certain legal entities and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited\npartnership. This new guidance was effective January 1, 2016, was applied retrospectively and did not result in any change to the\nCompany's consolidation conclusions. Disclosure requirements outlined in the new guidance are included in Note 30, Variable\ninterest entities.\n\nTCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016 122",
    "Page_16": "Imputation of interest\n\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on simplifying the accounting for debt issuance costs. This guidance requires that\ndebt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability\nconsistent with debt discounts or premiums. This new guidance was effective January 1, 2016, was applied retrospectively and\nresulted in a reclassification of debt issuance costs previously recorded in Intangible and other assets to an offset of their respective\ndebt liabilities on the Company's Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nBusiness combinations\n\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued guidance which intends to simplify the accounting measurement period adjustments in\nbusiness combinations. The amended guidance requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to the provisional amounts that are\nidentified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. In the period\nthe adjustment was determined, the guidance also requires the acquirer to record the effect on earnings of changes in\ndepreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the\naccounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This new guidance was effective January 1, 2016, was applied\nprospectively and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nClassification of certain cash receipts and cash payments\n\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on\nthe statement of cash flows. This new guidance is effective January 1, 2018, however, since early adoption is permitted, the\nCompany elected to retrospectively apply this guidance effective December 31, 2016. The application of this guidance did not have\na material impact on the classification of debt pre-payments or extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made\nafter a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and proceeds from the settlement of corporate\nowned life insurance. The Company has elected to classify distributions received from equity method investments using the nature\nof distributions approach as it is more representative of the nature of the underlying activities of the investments that generated\nthe distributions. As a result, certain comparative period distributions received from equity method investments have been\nreclassified from investing activities to cash generated from operations in the Consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nFuture Accounting Changes\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n\nIn 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. Current guidance allows for revenue\nrecognition when certain criteria are met. The new guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue in accordance with a five-\nstep model. This model is used to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\ntotal consideration to which it expects to be entitled during the term of the contract in exchange for those goods or services. The\nCompany will adopt the new standard on the effective date of January 1, 2018. There are two methods in which the new standard\ncan be applied: (1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (2) retrospectively with the cumulative effect\nrecognized at the date of initial application.\n\nThe Company is evaluating both methods of adoption as it works through its analysis. The Company has identified all existing\ncustomer contracts that are within the scope of the new guidance and has begun to analyze individual contracts or groups of\ncontracts to identify any significant differences and the impact on revenues as a result of implementing the new standard. As the\nCompany continues its contract analysis, it will also quantify the impact, if any, on prior period revenues. The Company will\naddress any system and process changes necessary to compile the information to meet the disclosure requirements of the new\nstandard. As the Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard, it has not yet determined the effect on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nInventory\n\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on simplifying the measurement of inventory. The new guidance specifies that an\nentity should measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is\nthe estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and\ntransportation. This new guidance is effective January 1, 2017 and will be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect the\nadoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n123 TCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016",
    "Page_17": "Financial instruments\n\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities. The new\nguidance will change the income statement effect of equity investments and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial\nliabilities when the fair value option is elected. The new guidance also requires the Company to assess valuation allowances for\ndeferred tax assets related to available for sale debt securities in combination with their other deferred tax assets. This new\nguidance is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance and has\nnot yet determined the effect on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nLeases\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on leases. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize most leases, including\noperating leases, on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities. In addition, lessees may be required to reassess\nassumptions associated with existing leases as well as to provide expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new\nstandard does not make extensive changes to lessor accounting. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2019, however, the\nCompany is evaluating the option to early adopt. The Company is currently identifying existing lease agreements that may have an\nimpact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new guidance.\n\nDerivatives and hedging\n\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call or put options\nthat can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. The new\nguidance requires only an assessment of the four-step decision sequence outlined in GAAP to determine whether the economic\ncharacteristics and risks of call or put options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks. This new\nguidance is effective January 1, 2017 and the Company does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material\nimpact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nEquity method investments\n\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that simplifies the transition to equity method accounting. In these situations, when\nan increase in ownership interest in an investment qualifies it for equity method accounting, the new guidance eliminates the\nrequirement to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting. This new guidance is effective January 1, 2017 and will be\napplied prospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nEmployee share-based payments\n\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment\ntransactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the\nstatement of cash flows. The new guidance also permits entities to make an accounting policy election either to continue to\nestimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered or to account for forfeitures when\nthey occur. This new guidance is effective January 1, 2017 and the Company does not expect the adoption of this new guidance\nto have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nMeasurement of credit losses on financial instruments\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that significantly changes how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets\nand certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The new guidance amends the impairment\nmodel of financial instruments basing it on expected losses rather than incurred losses. These expected credit losses will be\nrecognized as an allowance rather than a direct write down of the amortized cost basis.

    "Page_18": "Consolidation\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on consolidation relating to interests held through related parties that are under\ncommon control. The new guidance amends the consolidation requirements such that if a decision maker is required to evaluate\nwhether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE), it will need to consider only its proportionate indirect interest\nin the VIE held through a common control party. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2017 and the Company does not expect\nthe adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIncome taxes\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The\nnew guidance requires the recognition of deferred and current income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer when the transfer\noccurs. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and will be applied on a modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance and has not yet determined the effect\non its consolidated financial statements.\n\nRestricted cash\n\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The\nnew guidance requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total cash and cash\nequivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The amounts of restricted cash and\ncash equivalents will be included in Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of year and end of year total\namounts on the statement of cash flows. This new guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and will be applied retrospectively. Early\nadoption is permitted.

The acquisition was financed through the issuance of TCPL common shares to TransCanada and an intercompany loan due\nto TransCanada in connection with proceeds received from the sale of TransCanada subscription receipts. The sale of the\nsubscription receipts was completed on April 1, 2016 through a public offering, and gross proceeds of approximately $4.4 billion\nwere transferred to TCPL prior to the closing of the acquisition. In addition, TCPL drew on acquisition bridge facilities in the\naggregate amount of US$6.9 billion. Refer to Note 20, Common shares and Note 29, Related party transactions for additional\ninformation on the common shares issued to TransCanada and on the intercompany loan due to TransCanada. Refer to Note 17,\nLong-term debt for additional information on the acquisition bridge facilities.\n\nColumbia operates a portfolio of approximately 24,500 km (15,200 miles) of regulated natural gas pipelines, 285 Bcf of natural\ngas storage facilities and midstream and other assets in various regions in the U.S. TCPL acquired Columbia to expand the\nCompany’‘s natural gas business in the U.S. market, positioning the Company for additional long-term growth opportunities.\n\nThe goodwill of $10.1 billion (US$7.7 billion) arising from the acquisition principally reflects the opportunities to expand the\nCompany’‘s U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines segment and to gain a stronger competitive position in the North American natural gas\nbusiness. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method where the acquired tangible and\nintangible assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price\nequation reflects management's estimate of the fair value of Columbia’s assets and liabilities as at July 1, 2016.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJuly 1, 2016\n(millions of $) U.S. Canadian’\nPurchase Price Consideration 10,294 13,392\nFair Value of Net Assets Acquired\nCurrent assets 658 856\nPlant, property and equipment 7,560 9,835\nEquity investments 441 574\nRegulatory assets 190 248\nIntangibles and other assets 135 175\nCurrent liabilities (597) (777)\nRegulatory liabilities (294) (383)\nOther long-term liabilities (144) (187)\nDeferred income tax liabilities (1,613) (2,098)\nLong-term debt (2,981) (3,878)\nNon-controlling interests (808) (1,051)\nFair Value of Net Assets Acquired 2,547 3,314\nGoodwill (Note 11) 7,747 10,078\n\n \n\n1 At July 1, 2016 exchange rate of $1.30.\n\nThe fair values of current assets including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and inventories and the fair values of\ncurrent liabilities including notes payable and accrued interest approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of\nthese items.

    "Page_24": "Columbia’s natural gas pipelines are subject to FERC regulations and, as a result, their rate bases are expected to be recovered with\na reasonable rate of return over the life of the assets. These assets, as well as related regulatory assets and liabilities, have fair\nvalues equal to their carrying values. The fair value of mineral rights included in Columbia's plant, property and equipment was\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow approach which resulted in a fair value increase of $241 million (US$185 million). The fair\nvalue of base gas included in Columbia’s plant, property and equipment was determined by using a quoted market price multiplied\nby the volume of gas in place which resulted in a fair value increase of $840 million (US$646 million). The fair value of base gas is\nbased on preliminary information obtained and is subject to change as the Company completes its work on the volume acquired.\nAn adjustment to the fair value of base gas would impact the purchase price equation.\n\nThe fair value of Columbia's long-term debt was estimated using an income approach based on observable market rates for similar\ndebt instruments from external data service providers.

    "Page_29": "Keystone XL\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company reviewed its remaining investment in Keystone XL and related projects with a carrying value\nof $526 million (2015 — $621 million) and found no events or changes in circumstance indicating that the carrying value may not\nbe recoverable.\n\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company evaluated its investment in Keystone XL and related projects, including the Keystone Hardisty\nTerminal (KHT), for impairment in connection with the November 6, 2015 denial of the U.S. Presidential permit. As a result of the\nanalysis, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge in its Liquids Pipelines segment of $3,686 million ($2,891 million\nafter tax) based on the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of $621 million of these assets. The impairment\ncharge included $77 million ($56 million after tax) for certain cancellation fees that will be incurred in the future if the project is\nultimately abandoned.\n\nAt December 31, 2015, included in the estimated fair value of $621 million was $463 million related to plant and equipment. The\nfair value of these assets was based on the price that would be received on sale of the plant and equipment in its condition at\nDecember 31, 2015. Key assumptions used in the determination of selling price included an estimated two year disposal period\nand the then current weak energy market conditions. The valuation considered a variety of potential selling prices that were based\non the various markets that could be used in order to dispose of these assets.\n\nAt December 31, 2015, $158 million related to terminal assets, including KHT, was included in the fair value of $621 million. The\nfair value was determined using a discounted cash flow approach. The expected cash flows were discounted using a risk-adjusted\ndiscount rate to determine the fair value.\n\n \n\nThe valuation techniques above required the use of unobservable inputs. As a result, the fair value was classified within Level Ill of\nthe fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2015 . Refer to Note 24, Risk management and financial instruments for further\ninformation on the fair value hierarchy.\n\nEnergy Turbine Impairment\n\nFollowing the evaluation of specific capital project opportunities in 2015, it was determined that the carrying value of certain\nEnergy turbine equipment was not fully recoverable. These turbines had been previously purchased for a power development\nproject that did not proceed. As a result, at December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of\n$59 million ($43 million after tax) in the Energy segment. This impairment charge was based on the excess of the carrying value\nover the estimated fair value of the turbines, which was determined based on a comparison to similar assets available for sale in\nthe market.\n\nTCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016 136",

In accordance with a provision in the PPA, a buyer is permitted to terminate the arrangement if a change in law\noccurs that makes the arrangement unprofitable or more unprofitable. As a result of changes in law surrounding the Alberta\nSpecified Gas Emitters Regulation, the Company expected increasing costs related to carbon emissions to continue throughout the\nremaining term of the PPA resulting in increasing unprofitability. As a result, at March 31, 2016, the company recognized a non-\ncash impairment charge of $29 million ($21 million after tax) in its Energy segment income from equity investments which\nrepresented the carrying value of the equity investment in ASTC Partnership. The PPA termination was settled in December 2016.\n\n137 TCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016",

Rate-regulated businesses account for and report assets and liabilities consistent\nwith the economic impact of the way in which regulators establish rates, provided the rates established are designed to recover the\ncosts of providing the regulated service and the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and\ncollected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in the income\nstatement are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in the income statement as the related amounts are included in\nservice rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.\n\nCanadian Regulated Operations\n\nTCPL's Canadian natural gas pipelines are regulated by the NEB under the National Energy Board Act. The NEB regulates the\n\nconstruction and operation of facilities, and the terms and conditions of services, including rates, for the Company's Canadian\nregulated natural gas transmission systems.\n\nTCPL's Canadian natural gas transmission services are supplied under natural gas transportation tariffs that provide for cost\nrecovery, including return of and return on capital as approved by the NEB. Rates charged for these services are typically set\nthrough a process that involves filing an application with the regulator wherein forecasted operating costs, including a return of\nand on capital, determine the revenue requirement for the upcoming year or multiple years. To the extent that actual costs and\nrevenues are more or less than the forecasted costs and revenues, the regulators generally allow the difference to be deferred to a\nfuture period and recovered or refunded in rates at that time. Differences between actual and forecasted costs that the regulator\ndoes not allow to be deferred are included in the determination of net income in the year they occur. The Company's significant\nCanadian natural gas pipelines are described below.\n\nTCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016 138",
    "Page_32": "NGTL System\n\nIn April 2016, the NEB approved the NGTL System’s 2016-2017 Revenue Requirement Settlement. The terms of the two-year\nsettlement include an ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed equity, a continuation of the 2015 depreciation rates, a\nmechanism for sharing variances above and below a fixed annual operating, maintenance and administration (OM&A) cost amount\nand flow-through treatment of all other costs.\n\nThe NGTL System's 2015 results reflect the terms of the 2015 Revenue Requirement Settlement. This one year settlement included\na 10.1 per cent ROE on deemed common equity of 40 per cent, a continuation of the 2014 depreciation rates, a mechanism for\nsharing variances above and below a fixed annual OM&A cost amount that was based on an escalation of 2014 actual costs and\nflow-through treatment of all other costs.\n\nThe NGTL System's 2014 results reflect the terms of the 2013-2014 Revenue Requirement Settlement Application. This settlement\nincluded fixed annual OM&A costs and a 10.1 per cent ROE on a deemed common equity of 40 per cent and a continuation of\n2013 depreciation rates. Any variance between fixed OM8&A costs in the settlement and actual costs accrued to TCPL.\n\nCanadian Mainline\n\nThe Canadian Mainline currently operates under the terms of the 2015-2030 Tolls Application approved in 2014 (the NEB 2014\nDecision). The terms of the settlement include an ROE of 10.1 per cent on deemed common equity of 40 per cent, an incentive\nmechanism that has both upside and downside risk and a $20 million after-tax annual TCPL contribution to reduce the revenue\nrequirement. Toll stabilization is achieved through the continued use of deferral accounts, namely the long-term adjustment\naccount (LTAA) and the bridging amortization account, to capture the surplus or the shortfall between the Company's revenues\nand cost of service for each year over the six-year fixed toll term of the NEB 2014 Decision. A toll review filing will be required for\nthe 2018 to 2020 period.\n\nThe Canadian Mainline's 2014 results reflect the terms of the NEB 2013 Decision. The decision established an ROE of 11.5 per cent\non deemed common equity of 40 per cent and included mechanisms to achieve fixed tolls through use of the LTAA as well as\nestablishment of a Tolls Stabilization Account (TSA) to capture the surplus or the shortfall between revenues and cost of service for\neach year over the five-year term of the decision. In addition, the NEB 2013 Decision provided an opportunity to generate incentive\nearnings by increasing revenues and reducing costs.\n\nU.S. Regulated Operations\n\nTCPL's U.S. natural gas pipelines operate under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978\n(NGA) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The NGA grants the FERC authority over\nthe construction and operation of pipelines and related facilities, including the regulation of tariffs which incorporates maximum\n\nand minimum rates for services and allows U.S. natural gas pipelines to discount or negotiate rates on a non-discriminatory basis.\nThe Company's significant regulated U.S. natural gas pipelines, based on effective ownership and total operated pipe length, are\ndescribed below.\n\nColumbia Gas\n\nColumbia Gas' natural gas transportation and storage services are provided under a tariff at rates subject to FERC approval. In\n2013, the FERC approved a modernization settlement which provides for cost recovery and return on investment of up to\nUS$1.5 billion over a five-year period to modernize the Columbia Gas system to improve system integrity and enhance service\nreliability and flexibility. In March 2016, an extension of this settlement was approved by the FERC, which will allow for the cost\nrecovery and return on additional expanded scope investment of US$1.1 billion over a three-year period through 2020.\n\nColumbia Gulf\n\nColumbia Gulf’s natural gas transportation services are provided under a tariff at rates subject to FERC approval. In September\n2016, the FERC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement following a FERC-initiated rate proceeding pursuant to\nsection 5 of the NGA, which required a reduction in Columbia Gulf’s daily maximum recourse rate and addressed treatment of\npost-retirement benefits other than pensions, pension expense, and regulatory expenses. The FERC order also requires Columbia\nGulf to file a general rate case under section 4 of the NGA by January 31, 2020, for rates to take effect by August 1, 2020.\n\n139 TCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016",

The fair\nvalue of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of methods including a discounted cash flow approach and a\nrange of expected consideration from a potential sale. The expected cash flows were discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate\nto determine the fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge on the full carrying value of\nRavenswood goodwill of $1,085 million ($656 million after tax) within the Energy segment. The impairment charge was recorded\nprior to reclassification to Assets held for sale. Refer to Note 6, Assets held for sale for further detail.\n\nAt December 31, 2016, TCPL's Goodwill included US$573 million (2015 — US$573 million) related to the Great Lakes natural gas\ntransportation business. During 2015, TCPL's share of this goodwill (net of non-controlling interests) increased by US$143 million,\nto US$386 million, as a result of a 2015 impairment charge of US$199 million recorded by TC PipeLines, LP on its equity method\ngoodwill related to Great Lakes. On a consolidated basis, TCPL's carrying value of its investment in Great Lakes was proportionately\nlower compared to the 46.45 per cent owned through TC PipeLines, LP. As a result, the estimated fair value of Great Lakes\nexceeded TCPL's consolidated carrying value of the investment and no impairment was recorded in 2015.\n\nAt December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of Great Lakes exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 per cent. The fair value\nof this reporting unit was measured using a discounted cash flow analysis in its most recent valuation. Assumptions used in the\nanalysis regarding Great Lakes’ ability to realize long-term value in the North American energy market included the impact of\nchanging natural gas flows in its market region as well as a change in the Company's view of other strategic alternatives to\nincrease utilization of Great Lakes. Although evolving market conditions and other factors relevant to Great Lakes’ long term\nfinancial performance have remained relatively stable, there is a risk that reductions in future cash flow forecasts or adverse\nchanges in other key assumptions could result in a future impairment of a portion of the goodwill balance relating to Great Lakes.\n\n \n\n \n\nAt December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of ANR exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 per cent. The fair value of this\nreporting unit was measured using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assumptions regarding ANR’s ability to realize long-term value\ndepend upon trends in value for its storage services, continued growth in its asset base and favourable outcomes of future rate\nproceedings. The Company reduced long-term forecast cash flows from the reporting unit as compared to those utilized in\nprevious impairment tests thereby reflecting the continued changes in the business environment. There is a risk that continued\nreductions in future cash flow forecasts and adverse changes in other key assumptions could result in a future impairment of a\nportion of the goodwill balance relating to ANR. The goodwill balance related to ANR at December 31, 2016 was US$1.9 billion\n(2015 — US$1.9 billion).\n\nTCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016 142",

In\naccordance with a provision in the PPAs, a buyer is permitted to terminate the arrangement if a change in law occurs that makes\nthe arrangement unprofitable or more unprofitable. As a result of recent changes in law surrounding the Alberta Specified Gas\nEmitters Regulation, the Company expected increasing costs related to carbon emissions to continue throughout the remaining\nterms of the PPAs resulting in increasing unprofitability. As such, in 2016, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge\nof $211 million ($155 million after tax) in its Energy segment, which represented the carrying value of the PPAs. Upon final\nsettlement of the PPA terminations in December 2016, TCPL transferred to the Balancing Pool a package of environmental credits\nthat were being held to offset the PPA emissions costs and recorded a non-cash charge of $92 million ($68 million after tax)\nrelated to the carrying value of these environmental credits.\n\nAmortization expense of $9 million was recognized in the Consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31,\n2016 (2015 and 2014 — $52 million), prior to the termination of the arrangements.\n\nNOTES PAYABLE\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2016 2015\n\nWeighted Weighted\n\nAverage Average\n\nInterest Rate Interest Rate\n\nOutstanding at per Annum Outstanding at per Annum\n\n(millions of Canadian $, unless otherwise noted) December 31 at December 31 December 31 at December 31\nCanadian 509 0.9% 697 0.8%\nU.S. (2016 — US$197; 2015 - US$376) 265 0.5% 521 1.1%\n\n774 1,218\n\n \n\n143 TCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016",

    "Page_56": "RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nRisk Management Overview\nTCPL has exposure to market risk and counterparty credit risk, and has strategies, policies and limits in place to manage the impact\nof these risks on earnings and cash flow.\n\nRisk management strategies, policies and limits are designed to ensure TCPL's risks and related exposures are in line with the\nCompany's business objectives and risk tolerance. Market risk and counterparty credit risk are managed within limits ultimately\nestablished by the Company's Board of Directors, implemented by senior management and monitored by the Company's risk\nmanagement and internal audit groups. The Board of Directors' Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance\nwith market risk and counterparty credit risk management policies and procedures, and oversees management's review of the\nadequacy of the risk management framework.\n\nMarket Risk\n\nThe Company constructs and invests in energy infrastructure projects, purchases and sells commodities, issues short-term and long-\nterm debt, including amounts in foreign currencies, and invests in foreign operations. Certain of these activities expose the\nCompany to market risk from changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which may affect the\nCompany's earnings and the value of the financial instruments it holds. The Company assesses contracts used to manage market\nrisk to determine whether all, or a portion, meets the definition of a derivative.\n\nDerivative contracts the Company uses to assist in managing the exposure to market risk may consist of the following:\n\n¢ Forwards and futures contracts — contractual agreements to purchase or sell a specific financial instrument or commodity at a\nspecified price and date in the future. TCPL enters into foreign exchange and commodity forwards and futures to manage the\nimpact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices\n\n¢ Swaps — contractual agreements between two parties to exchange streams of payments over time according to specified\nterms. The Company enters into interest rate, cross-currency and commodity swaps to manage the impact of changes in\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices\n\n¢ Options — contractual agreements that convey the right, but not the obligation of the purchaser to buy or sell a specific\namount of a financial instrument or commodity at a fixed price, either at a fixed date or at any time within a specified period.\nThe Company enters into option agreements to manage the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and\ncommodity prices.\n\nCommodity price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to commodity price movements as part of its normal business operations. A number of strategies are\n\nused to manage these exposures, including the following:\n\n¢ — Subject to its overall risk management strategy, the Company commits a portion of its expected power supply to fixed-price\nmedium-term or long-term sales contracts, while reserving an amount of unsold supply to manage operational and price risks\nin its asset portfolio\n\n¢ The Company purchases a portion of the natural gas required for its power plants or enters into contracts that base the sale\nprice of electricity on the cost of natural gas, effectively locking in a margin\n\n¢ The Company's power sales commitments are fulfilled through power generation or through purchased contracts, thereby\nreducing the Company's exposure to fluctuating commodity prices\n\n¢ The Company enters into offsetting or back-to-back positions using derivative instruments to manage price risk exposure in\npower and natural gas commodities created by certain fixed and variable pricing arrangements for different pricing indices\nand delivery points.\n\nNatural gas storage commodity price risk\n\nTCPL manages its exposure to seasonal natural gas price spreads in its non-regulated Natural Gas Storage business by economically\nhedging storage capacity with a portfolio of third-party storage capacity contracts and proprietary natural gas purchases and sales.\nTCPL simultaneously enters into a forward purchase of natural gas for injection into storage and an offsetting forward sale of\nnatural gas for withdrawal at a later period, thereby locking in future positive margins and effectively eliminating exposure to\nnatural gas price movements. Unrealized gains and losses on fair value adjustments recorded each period on these forward\ncontracts are not necessarily representative of the amounts that will be realized on settlement.\n\n163 TCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016",
    "Page_57": "Liquids marketing commodity price risk\n\nThe liquids marketing business began operations in 2016. TCPL enters into short-term or long-term pipeline and storage terminal\ncapacity contracts, primarily on the Company's assets, increasing the utilization of those assets and earning the market value of the\ncapacity. Derivative instruments are used to fix a portion of the variable price exposures that arise from physical liquids\ntransactions.\n\nForeign exchange and interest rate risk\n\nForeign exchange and interest rate risk is created by fluctuations in the fair value or cash flow of financial instruments due to\nchanges in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. TCPL generates revenues and incurs expenses that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than Canadian dollars. As a result, our earnings and cash flows are expected to fluctuate.\n\nA portion of TCPL’s earnings from its U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines, Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines, Liquids Pipelines and Energy\nsegments are generated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar\ncan affect TCPL’s net income. As the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated operations continue to grow, exposure to changes in\ncurrency rates increases. This foreign exchange impact is partially offset by interest expense on U.S. dollar-denominated debt and\nby using foreign exchange derivatives.\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency and interest rate derivatives to manage the foreign exchange and interest rate risks related to\nother U.S. dollar-denominated transactions including those that may arise on some of the Company’s regulated assets. The realized\ngains and losses on these derivatives are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities until they are recovered from or paid to the\nshippers.\n\nTCPL has floating interest rate debt which subjects it to interest rate cash flow risk. The Company uses a combination of interest\nrate swaps and options to manage its exposure to this risk.\n\nNet investment in foreign operations\nThe Company hedges its net investment in foreign operations (on an after-tax basis) with U.S. dollar-denominated debt, cross-\ncurrency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange options.\n\nU.S. Dollar-Denominated Debt Designated as a Net Investment Hedge\nThe notional amounts and fair value of U.S. dollar-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge were as follows:\n\n \n\nat December 31\n\n \n\n(millions of Canadian $, unless otherwise noted) 2016 2015\nNotional amount 26,600 (US 19,800) 23,100 (US 16,700)\nFair value 29,400 (US 21,900) 23,800 (US 17,200)\n\n \n\nDerivatives Designated as a Net Investment Hedge\nThe fair values and notional or principal amounts for the derivatives designated as a net investment hedge were as follows:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2016 2015\n\nat December 31 .

Credit risk has\nbeen taken into consideration when calculating the fair value of derivative instruments.\n\nIn some cases, even though the derivatives are considered to be effective economic hedges, they do not meet the specific criteria\nfor hedge accounting treatment or are not designated as a hedge and are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in net income in the period of change. This may expose the Company to increased variability in reported earnings\nbecause the fair value of the derivative instruments can fluctuate significantly from period to period.\n\nThe recognition of gains and losses on derivatives for Canadian natural gas regulated pipeline exposures is determined through the\nregulatory process. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as part of RRA, including\nthose that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, can be recovered or refunded through the tolls charged by the Company. As a\nresult, these gains and losses are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and are refunded to or collected from the\nratepayers in subsequent years when the derivative settles.\n\nTCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016 166",

Valuation of options is based on the Black-Scholes pricing model.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value can fluctuate between Level II and Level Ill depending on the\nproportion of the value of the contract that extends beyond the time frame for which significant inputs are\nconsidered to be observable.

    "Page_70": "VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n\nAs a result of the implementation of the new FASB guidance on consolidation, a number of entities controlled by TCPL are now\n\nconsidered to be VIEs. A VIE is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional\n\nsubordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to\n\nthe entity’s operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a variable interest and for which it is considered to\n\nbe the primary beneficiary. VIEs in which the Company has a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for\n\nas equity investments.\n\nConsolidated VIEs\n\nThe Company's consolidated VIEs consist of legal entities where the Company is the primary beneficiary. As the primary\n\nbeneficiary, the Company has the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly\n\nimpact economic performance including purchasing or selling significant assets; maintenance and operations of assets; incurring\n\nadditional indebtedness; or determining the strategic operating direction of the entity. In addition, the Company has the obligation\n\nto absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the consolidated VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nA significant portion of the Company's assets are held through VIEs in which the Company holds a 100 per cent voting interest,\n\nthe VIE meets the definition of a business and the VIE’s assets can be used for general corporate purposes. The assets and liabilities\n\nof the consolidated VIEs whose assets cannot be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE's obligations are as\n\nfollows:\n\n \n\nat December 31\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(millions of Canadian $) 2016 2015\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents 77 54\nAccounts receivable 71 55\nInventories 25 25\nOther 10 6\n183 140\nPlant, Property and Equipment 3,685 3,704\nEquity Investments 606 664\nGoodwill 525 541\nIntangible and Other Assets 1 —\n5,000 5,049\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts payable and other 80 74\nAccrued interest 21 21\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 76 45\n177 140\nRegulatory Liabilities 34 33\nOther Long-Term Liabilities 4 4\nDeferred Income Tax Liabilities 7 —\nLong-Term Debt 2,827 2,998\n3,049 3,175\n\n \n\n177 TCPL Consolidated financial statements 2016",
