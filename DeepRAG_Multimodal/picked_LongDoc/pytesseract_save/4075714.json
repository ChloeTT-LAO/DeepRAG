    "Page_5": "William Christenberry: Kodachromes\n\nText by Richard B. Woodward.\n\nAlthough best known for his large-format color photographs made with vintage Kodak Brownie cameras, William\nChristenberry has also consistently produced work with 35 mm Kodachrome slide film since he took up photography. William\nChristenberry: Kodachromes is the first publication to showcase this stunning and previously unknown body of work, spanning\nfrom 1964 to 2007, of which only a small number of images have ever been published or exhibited. As in all of Christenberry’s\nphotographs, the subject matter is the rural Deep South: the twisting back roads, open landscapes, rusted signage and\nramshackle vernacular architecture found in Hale County, Alabama. Though many of the sites pictured in this rare collection\nare new, other subjects have grown iconic in Christenberry's oeuvre as he has returned to photograph them over the\ndecades—the red building in the forest, Sprott Church, the Palmist Sign and the Bar-B-O Inn, among others. The photographs\nin William Christenberry: Kodachromes were made with a camera that allowed for greater mobility, revealing new ways of\nconsidering Christenberry’s perennial subjects and offering further insight into the working method of this venerable artist.\nWilliam Christenberry (born 1936) has been a professor at the Corcoran College of Art and Design, Washington, D.C., since\n1968. His work has been the subject of dozens of solo shows and exhibitions over the last 40 years, and can be found in\nnumerous permanent collections, including those of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.; The Museum\nof Modern Art and Whitney Museum of American Art, both in New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; San Francisco\nMuseum of Modern Art; and Center for Creative Photography, Tucson.

Rather than simply surveying the damage, Misrach—who has photographed the region\nregularly since the 1970s, most notably for his ongoing Cancer Alley project—found himself drawn to the\nhurricane-inspired graffiti: messages scrawled in spray paint, crayons, chalk or whatever materials residents and\nrescue workers happened to have on hand. At turns threatening, desperate, clinical and even darkly humorous, the\nphrases he captures—the only text that appears in the book—offer revealing and unique human perspectives on\nthe devastation and shock left in the wake of this disaster. Destroy This Memory presents previously unpublished\nand starkly compelling material, all of which Misrach shot with his 4 MP pocket camera while also working on a\nseparate archive of over 1,000 photographs with his 8 x 10 large-format camera. Created between October and\nDecember 2005, this series of images serves as a potent, unalloyed document of the raw experiences of those left\nto fend for themselves in the aftermath of Katrina. With no essay, titles or even page numbers in the way, the\nwords on these homes, cars and trees offer a searing testament that continues to speak volumes, five years after\ntheir original inscription.\n\nRichard Misrach (born 1949) is credited with helping to pioneer the renaissance of color photography and large-\nscale presentation in the 1970s. He has exhibited extensively, and his work is held in the permanent collections\n\nof prestigious institutions such as The Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and The\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, in New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston;\nand Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nRichard Misrach: Destroy This Memory\nISBN 978-1-59711-163-8\n\nHbk, 15 x 11.5 in. / 140 pgs / 70 color.\nU.S. $65.00 CDN $78.00\nSeptember/Photography\n\nExhibition Schedule\nNew Orleans, LA: The New Orleans Museum of Art, 08/28/10-10/24/10\nHouston, TX: Museum of Fine Arts, 8/10\n\nThe graffiti of the\ndesperate and the\ndispossessed:\nRichard Misrach’s\nphoto-portrait of\nthe words written\nby the victims of\nHurricane Katrina.\n\nwww.artbook.com\n\n \n\n7",

Text by Michael Beirut, Thomas L. Friedman, Steven Heller,\nEdward Morris, Dmitri Siegel.\n\nThis book brings together the strongest contemporary graphic design currently promoting sustainability and the fight\nagainst climate change. Collectively, essays by Michael Beirut, Steven Heller, Edward Morris and Dmitri Siegel look back\nin time to posters and ideas that set the stage for the current movement (World War Two posters, images of interna-\ntional cooperation, posters from the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s) and address the “state of the\nposter”: what is the efficacy and mode of distribution for purposeful, message-oriented graphic images today? Thomas\nL. Friedman advocates for “a redefined, broader and more muscular green ideology that can be the basis of anew\nunifying political movement for the twenty-first century.” The bulk of the book is given over to a compilation of the\nbest posters on the theme of sustainability by a variety of contemporary artists (both emerging and established),\namong them Shepard Fairey, Michael Beirut, DJ Spooky, James Victore and Geoff McFetridge. These posters, which have\na strong graphic presence and which never rest on the tired slogans of the past (“Save the Earth,” etc.), show that\ngraphic design does not passively respond to the zeitgeist—it helps shape it. The book, which is sustainably printed in\nthe U.S., reproduces 50 of these posters as tear-outs. Also included is a section on action, with documentation of\ndesigns at work in the world: on buses, billboards, protesters’ placards, graffiti, t-shirts and so on.

    "Page_7": "Small Scale, Big Change\n\nNew Architectures of Social Engagement\n\nIntroduction by Barry Bergdoll. Text by Andres Lepik.\n\nThe role of the global architect in society is changing. Instead of waiting for commissions to come their\nway, architects are initiating and developing practical solutions in response to dramatically changing\nliving conditions in many parts of the world today. Small Scale, Big Change focuses on a central chapter\nof this shift, presenting recently built or under-construction works in underserved communities around\nthe globe by these 11 architects and firms: Elemental (Chilean); Anna Heringer (Austrian); Diébédo Francis\nKéré (Burkinabé); Hashim Sarkis A.LU.D. (Lebanese); Jorge Mario Jauregui (Brazilian); Frédéric Druot, Anne\nLacaton & Jean Philippe Vassal (French); Michael Maltzan Architecture (American); Noero Wolff Architects\n(South African); Rural Studio (American); Estudio Teddy Cruz (American, born Guatemala); and Urban\nThink Tank (American/Austrian/Venezuelan). Without sacrificing concern for aesthetics, these architects\nhave developed projects that reveal a post-utopian specificity of place; their architectural solutions\nemerge from close collaboration with future users and sustained research into local conditions. The\nprojects—which include schools, parks, housing and infrastructural interventions—reveal an exciting\nchange in the longstanding dialogue between architecture and society, as the architect’s roles, methods,\napproaches and responsibilities are dramatically reevaluated. They also offer an expanded definition of\nsustainability that moves beyond experimentation with new materials and technologies to encompass\nlarger concepts of social and economic sustainability. Small Scale, Big Change examines the evolving\nstandards of responsibility and participation in architecture and the ways in which architects can engage\ncritically with larger social, economic and political issues currently facing communities around the world.\n\nSmall Scale, Big Change\n\nISBN 978-0-87070-784-1\n\nPbk, 8 x 10 in. / 140 pgs / 170 color.\n\nU.S. $37.50 CDN $45.00\n\nOctober/Architecture & Urban Studies/Sustainability\n\n10 | D.A.P. | 1:800.338.2665 F: 800.478.3128\n\n \n\nExhibition Schedule\nNew York: The Museum of Modern Art,\n10/03/10-01/03/11\n\nA timely compendium featuring 11 architectural\nfirms at the forefront of sustainability.\n\nThe Power of Pro Bono\n\n40 Stories About Design for the Public\nGood by Architects and Their Clients\nEdited by John Cary, Public Architecture.\nForeword by Majora Carter.

Through his street roots in graffiti,\nBasquiat helped to establish new possibilities for figu-\nrative and expressionistic painting, breaking the white\nmale stranglehold of Conceptual and Minimal art, and\nforeshadowing, among other tendencies, Germany’s\nJunge Wilde movement. It was not only Basquiat’s art\nbut also the details of his biography that made his\nname legendary—his early years as “Samo” (his graffiti\nartist moniker), his friendships with Andy Warhol, Keith\nHaring and Madonna and his tragically early death\nfrom a heroin overdose. This superbly produced retro-\nspective publication assesses Basquiat’s luminous\ncareer with commentary by, among others, Glenn\nO’Brien, and 160 color reproductions of the work.\nJean-Michel Basquiat was born in Brooklyn, New York,\nto a Puerto Rican mother and a Haitian father—an\nethnic mix that meant young Jean-Michel was fluent\nin French, Spanish and English by the age of 11. In 1977,\nat the age of 17, Basquiat took up graffiti, inscribing the\nlandscape of downtown Manhattan with his signature\n“Samo.” In 1980 he was included in the landmark group\nexhibition The Times Square Show; the following year,\nat the age of 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist\never to be invited to Documenta. By 1982, Basquiat\n\nhad befriended Andy Warhol, later collaborating\n\nwith him; Basquiat was much affected by Warhol’s\ndeath in 1987. He died of a heroin overdose on August\n22, 1988, at the age of 27.\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2593-4\n\nHbk, 10.75 x 12.25 in. / 224 pgs / 334 color.\nU.S. $65.00 CDN $78.00\nOctober/Art/African American Art & Culture\n\nExhibition Schedule\nRiehen/Basel, Switzerland: Fondation Beyeler,\n05/09/10-09/05/10\n\n \n\nPicasso arrived at primitive art in order to give of its nobility to western art.\nAnd | arrived at Picasso to give his nobility to the art called “primitive.”\n—Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nAlso Available:\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat\n9788881582396\n\nPbk, U.S. $55.00 CDN $66.00\nCharta\n\n \n\n \n\n14 | D.A.P. | 1:800.338.2665 F: 800.478.3128\n\nNeo Rauch: Paintings\n\nEdited by Hans-Werner Schmidt, Bernhart Schwenk.\nWhen the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the artist Neo Rauch\nwas 30 years old, living in his East German hometown of\nLeipzig and just beginning to exhibit his paintings. It\nwas the perfect moment for a painter who had been\nreared on Social Realism to gain access to art outside\nEast Germany, to receive its influences into his art and to\nemerge onto the stage of world art as a star. At first\nclosely identified with the generation of painters known\nas the Leipzig School, in recent years Rauch’s wonderfully\nbizarre blend of Social Realism (not exactly a widely-\nmined style in contemporary art) with de Chirico or\nStanley Spencer has come to be seen as a painterly\nbarometer of post-Communist Europe. “Post-Communist\nSurrealism” could therefore be one way to describe the\nlook of his canvases, which convey narrative intent—\nmen and women from various historical eras performing\nobscure tasks in uniform, or midway through some\nominous occasion—shifting styles several times within\nthe same picture, but always displaying a lush brush-\nwork. Rauch has established a particularly strong audi-\nence in the U.S., having been championed by The New\nYork Times’ Roberta Smith as the painter of the zeitgeist.\nMarking Rauch’s fiftieth birthday and a simultaneous\nretrospective in Leipzig and Munich featuring works\ndating from 1982 to early 2010, this monograph is the\nmost substantial appraisal of his work published to\ndate. In it, his friends and colleagues supply testimonies,\namong them Luc Tuymans, Jonathan Meese and Michaél\nBorremans. Alongside essays by critics and historians,\nTimm Rautert provides a photographic portrait of\nRauch’s studio.\n\nNeo Rauch (born 1960) was born, reared and trained\n\nas an artist in Leipzig, where he continues to live.

Text by Roxana Marcoci, Geoffrey Batchen, Tobia Bezzola.\n\nSince its birth in the first half of the nineteenth century, photography has offered extraordinary possibilities\nof documenting, redefining and disseminating works of art. Through crop, focus, angle of view, degree of\nclose-up and lighting, as well as through expostfacto techniques of dark room manipulation, collage,\nmontage and assemblage, artists not only interpret the works they record but create stunning reinventions\nof them. The Original Copy: Photography of Sculpture, 1839 to Today presents a critical examination of the\nintersections between photography and sculpture, exploring how the one medium has become implicated\nin the understanding of the other. Through a selection of nearly 300 outstanding pictures by more than\n100 artists from the nineteenth century to the present, The Original Copy looks at how and why sculpture\nbecame a photographic subject and how photography at once informs and challenges our knowledge of\nsculpture.

Anthroposophy combined elements of German philosophy with\nTheosophical theory, and also made use of architecture, dance (“Eurthymy’”), painting and sculpture\nto illustrate his ideas. Steiner's artworks occupy a fascinatingly ambiguous status as both pedagogi-\ncal and aesthetic entities, and served as springboards for the early work of Mondrian and Kandinsky\namong others; they have continued to influence artists down the generations. In 1992, Steiner's\npanel drawings were exhibited at the Galerie Monika Spriith in Cologne, renewing their efficacy for\ncontemporary artists.

Text by Javier Arnaldo, Max\nHollein, Sandra Oppmann, et al.\n\nErnst Ludwig Kirchner painted city life as a joyous, bustling\npageant, a sophisticated swirl of desiring bodies and color-\nful urbanity, giving Germany an energetic iconography for\nthe glory days of modernity. One of the four founders of\nDie Briicke (The Bridge), Kirchner drew on German\nRenaissance art to conjure expressive exaggerations of\nface and posture, and brought to landscape painting a city-\ndweller’s zest, imbuing tranquil scenery with riotous ener-\ngy. Coinciding with a Kirchner retrospective at the Stadel\nMuseum—the first to be seen in Germany in 30 years—\nthis massive volume surveys the artist’s several creative\nphases and genres. It features the famous nudes made\nduring the Die Briicke era, his classic scenes of frenetic\nBerlin city life and Swiss mountainscapes from Davos,\nalong with lesser-known canvases, works on paper and\nsculpture. With essays by renowned art historians, this\ndefinitive monograph offers fresh perspective on the con-\ntinued relevance of Kirchner.\n\nBorn in Bavaria, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938) studied\narchitecture in Dresden, where he met the young painter\nFritz Beyl. With Beyl, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff and Erich\nHeckel, Kirchner founded the group known as Die Briicke.\nCasting aside the then-prevalent academic style of\npainting, Kirchner and his friends allied themselves with\nearly Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Durer, Matthias\nGrtinewald and Cranach the Elder, and revived older\n\nmedia such as woodcut printing. Kirchner briefly saw\narmy service in the First World War, but suffered a nervous\nbreakdown and was discharged. In the interbellum years\nKirchner's reputation grew enormously, until the Nazi\nregime branded his art degenerate: in 1937 over 600 of\n\nhis works were sold or destroyed. In 1938, despairing of\nthis destruction and the general political climate, Kirchner\ncommitted suicide.\n\nKirchner\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2553-8\n\nHbk, 9.5 x 11.75 in. / 304 pgs / 380 color.\nU.S. $75.00 CDN $90.00\nSeptember/Art\n\nExhibition Schedule\nFrankfurt: Stadel Museum, 04/23/10-07/25/10\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt seems as though the goal of my work has always\nbeen to dissolve myself completely into the sensations\nof the surroundings in order to then integrate this into\na coherent painterly form. —Ernst Ludwig Kirchner\n\nErnst Ludwig Kirchner: Art to Hear Also Available:\nISBN 978-3-7757-2555-2\n\nCD-Audio, 8.75 x 8.75 in. / 44 pgs / 32 color.\nU.S. $30.00 CDN $36.00\n\nSeptember/Art\n\nHatje Cantz\n\nKirchner And The Berlin Street\n9780870707414\n\nHbk, U.S. $35.00 CDN $42.00\nThe Museum of Modern Art,\nNew York\n\n \n\nwww.artbook.com | 19",

Without them, as the great Italian\nart writer Roberto Longhi once noted, “Ribera,\nVermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never\nhave existed... and the art of Delacroix, Courbet\nand Manet would have been utterly different.”\nIt was Longhi who rescued Caravaggio’s paint-\ning for the twentieth century, prior to which it\nhad lain dormant since the painter’s mysteri-\nous death in 1610. During Caravaggio’s lifetime,\nhowever, his work was enormously influential\nand controversial. Each of his innovations in\nsome way upset the prevailing tendencies of\nthe day—not least when his insistence on\nphysical realism led him to paint Saint\nMatthew as a bald peasant with dirty legs\n(attended upon by an irreverently intimate boy\nangel).

His drawings of male nudes in particular, fraught as they\nare with tempestuous longing, project both tension and pliancy, and a\ncompelling sense of health in the exertions and torque of bodies; he\nwas also readily able to bring contrary qualities of grace and swiftness\nto depictions of women and cherubim.

Works by other artists, done after the master's sketch-\nes, further illuminate the enormous influence of Michelangelo's art.\nPainter, sculptor, poet, architect and engineer, Michelangelo di\nLodovico Buonarroti Simoni (1475-1564) was both dauntingly prolific\nand relentlessly innovative in output. He sculpted two of his greatest\nworks, the “Pieta” and “David,” before he turned 30, and created two of\nthe world’s best-known paintings on the ceiling and walls of the\nSistine Chapel in Rome—the creation scenes from “Genesis” and “The\nLast Judgment.” Giorgio Vasari proposed that Michelangelo represent-\ned the pinnacle of all artistic achievement since the beginning of the\nRenaissance, a view that has survived to this day.\n\nMichelangelo: The Drawings of a Genius\nISBN 978-3-7757-2589-7\n\nHbk, 9.5 x 10.75 in. / 448 pgs / 310 color.\nU.S. $75.00 CDN $90.00\n\nDecember/Art\n\nExhibition Schedule\nVienna: Albertina, 10/08/10-01/09/11\n\n~\n\nMICHELANGELO\n\nThe Drawings of a Genins\n\n \n\nOh, truly happy age of ours!

Interior\nscenes of dining tables, bathroom sinks, toilets, dressers are depicted\nin sober light that recall Chardin or the “intimisme’” of Vuillard—\nthough Lopez Garcia surpasses even these masters in his ability to\nmake unforgivingly prosaic subject matter, such as a brick wall or a\nrefrigerator, sparkle and throb with mood. The artist’s statement\nthat “you work until the whole surface has an expressive intensity\nequivalent to what you have before you, converted into a pictorial\nreality” conveys something of the labor he brings to his works: Lopez\nGarcia is not a prolific artist, and as a result shows rarely (his 2008\nexhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, consolidated his\nalready strong audience in the U.S.). His drawings and paintings are\nequally esteemed, but until now, the drawings have never been the\nsubject of a monograph. All of the work in this superbly designed\npublication has been carefully selected by the artist’s daughter,\nMaria; much of it has never been reproduced until now. Including\n200 color plates and a moving text by the artist himself, it stands\n\nas a powerful testimony to Lopez Garcia's astounding achievement.\nAntonio L6pez Garcia (born 1936) studied at the School of Art in\nMadrid in the early 1950s, and quickly became part of a nucleus of\nrealist painters, such as Francisco Lopez Hernandez, Amalia Avia\n\nand Isabel Quintanilla.

Preface by Alfred Pacquement.\nIntroduction by Cécile Debray. Text by Eric Darragon, Jean\nClair, Laurence des Cars, Philippe Comar, Richard Shiff, Cécile\nDebray, Elsa Urtizverea.\n\nOne of the greatest living painters and portraitists, Lucian Freud\n(born 1922) brings a powerfully obsessive scrutiny to bear upon his\nsubjects. “I want the painting to be flesh,” Freud has avowed, and\nthrough this aspiration he achieves almost devastatingly unsenti-\nmental and revelatory portraits of his sitters, as he translates the\nact of scrutiny into strokes of paint. Like the studio of his friend\nFrancis Bacon, Freud’s own studio has attained its own intensity as\nthe site of his one-on-one encounters, and as a backdrop or stage\nin his paintings, and the atmosphere of his interiors, and in the\nlight in them, are among his paintings’ most pungent qualities.\n(One of his earliest canvases, from 1944, is titled “The Painter's\nRoom.”) Accompanying the critically acclaimed spring 2010\nPompidou retrospective, this mammoth survey posits Freud’s stu-\ndio as the decisive stage for his art, and tracks his career in over\n200 color illustrations of paintings, graphic works and photo-\ngraphs. Included here are his large interiors, his nudes and varia-\ntions on portraits by earlier masters, his famous series of self-\nportraits and imposing portraits of sitters such as Leigh Bowery\nand substantial photographic documentation of the studio. Lucian\nFreud: The Studio is the essential book on the artist.\n\nGrandson of Sigmund Freud, Lucian Freud was born in Germany in\n1922, and permanently relocated to London in 1933 during the\nascent of the Nazi regime. After seeing brief service during the\nSecond World War, Freud had his first solo exhibition in 1944 at the\nAlex Reid & Lefevre Gallery in London. Despite exhibiting only occa-\nsionally over the course of his career, Freud’s 1995 portrait “Benefits\nSupervisor Sleeping” was sold at auction, at Christie's New York in\nMay 2008, for $33.6 million—setting a world record for sale value\nof a painting by a living artist.\n\nLucian Freud: The Studio\n\nISBN 978-3-7774-2691-4\n\nHbk, 9.25 x 11.75 in. / 256 pgs / 201 color / 43 b&w.\n\nU.S. $65.00 CDN $78.00\n\nMay/Art\n\nExhibition Schedule\nParis: Centre Pompidou, 03/10/10-07/19/10\n\n \n\n...

In search of a\nfresh start, Strand traveled to Mexico City in late 1932 at the\ninvitation of Carlos Chavez, the eminent Mexican composer\nand conductor. The work he created during this key period\nreflects a time of intense productivity, creative renewal, and\nthe evolution of Strand’s foundational idea of the “collective\nportrait,” in which he depicted a region through photographs\nof individuals, still lifes and studies of architecture and\nreligious subjects. The first publication to chronicle this\npivotal time in Strand’s career (1932-34), Paul Strand in\nMexico demonstrates how, through his photographic studies\nand work in film, Strand deepened his involvement with\nMexican art, society, and revolutionary politics. Shedding\nnew light on this little-known chapter of Strand's life, a\nscholarly analysis by James Krippner (Associate Professor\nof History at Haverford College, Pennsylvania) brings\ntogether primary research from distinguished archives\nand institutions in both Mexico and the United States, and\nMexican photo-historian Alfonso Morales contributes an\nessay contextualizing this remarkable body of work within\nthe canon of Mexican photography and film of the 1930s.\nAdditionally, the appendix serves as the catalogue raisonné\nof Strand’s entire photographic output in Mexico.

Throughout her\ncareer, Mann has fearlessly pushed her explo-\nration of the human form, tackling often diffi-\ncult subject matter and making unapologeti-\ncally sensual images that are simultaneously\nbold and lyrical. This beautifully produced pub-\nlication includes Mann’s earliest platinum\nprints from the late 1970s, Polaroid still lifes,\nearly color work of her children, haunting land-\nscape images, recent self-portraits and nude\nstudies of her husband. These series document\nMann's interest in the body as principal sub-\nject, with the associated issues of vulnerability\nand mortality lending an elegiac note to her\nimages. In bringing them together, author and\ncurator John Ravenal examines the varied ways\nin which Mann's experimental approach,\nincluding ambrotypes and gelatin-silver prints\nmade from collodian wet-plate negatives,\nmoves her subjects from the corporeal to the\nethereal. Ravenal also supplies a comprehen-\nsive introduction as well as individual entries\non each series, and essays by David Levi Strauss\n(“Eros, Psyche, and the Mendacity of\nPhotography”) and Anne Wilkes Tucker (“Living\nMemory”) add different, but equally illuminat-\ning perspectives to this work.

Text by Hiroshi Sugimoto, Kerry Brougher.\n\nGenius of the large-format camera, the long exposure and the silverprint, New York-based photog-\nrapher Hiroshi Sugimoto has made pictures that seem to contain whole aeons of time within\nthemselves, and suggest an infinite palette of tonal wealth in blacks, grays and whites. Many of\nthese images have now become a part of art culture's popular image bank (as U2’s use of\nSugimoto’s “Boden Sea” for the cover of their 2009 album, No Line on the Horizon, demonstrated),\nwhile simultaneously evoking photography’s earliest days: “I probably call myself a postmodern-\nexperienced pre-postmodern modernist,” he once joked to an interviewer. This absolutely exquisite\nretrospective is an expanded edition of Hatje Cantz’s 2005 volume. It is the first to feature works\nfrom all of Sugimoto’s series to date: his celebrated portraits of wax figures, his incredible\nseascapes that seem to suggest a person's first conscious view of the ocean, the extremely long\nexposures of theaters which elevate the white, luminescent cinema screen and transform it into a\nmagical image of an altar and the fascinating dioramas of scientific display cases, which invite us\nto travel far into the past. Additions to the original edition are two new groups of works, “Lightning\nFields” (2006) and “Photogenic Drawings” (2007).\n\nHiroshi Sugimoto was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, where he studied politics and sociology at\nSt. Paul’s University, later retraining as an artist at the Art Center College of Art and Design in\nLos Angeles, CA.

As Gerry Badger, coauthor of The Photobook:\nA History, Volumes | and Il, asserts, “Adams, Shore, Baltz—all the New Topographics photographers\nmade great books, but none are better than The Pond.” Consisting of photographs taken around and\naway from a pond situated in an unkempt wooded area at the edge of a city, the volume presents a\nconsidered foil to Henry Thoreau’s stay at Walden. The photographs in The Pond do not aspire to the\n“beauty” of classical landscapes in the tradition of Ansel Adams. Instead, they reveal a subtle vision\nof reality on the border between man and nature. Gossage depicts nature in full splendor, yet at\nodds with both itself and man, but his tone is ambiguous and evocative rather than didactic. Robert\nAdams described the work as “believable because it includes evidence of man’s darkness of spirit,\nmemorable because of the intense fondness [Gossage] shows for the remains of the natural world.”\nAperture now reissues this exquisitely produced and highly collectible classic monograph. With the\naddition of three images and two essays, this second edition offers new audiences the opportunity\nto celebrate this notable work by a master photographer and bookmaker.\n\nJohn Gossage (born 1946) is well known for his artist’s books and photographic publications, and\nhas produced 17 books and boxes on specific bodies of work. In the 1960s, he studied briefly with\nLisette Model and Alexey Brodovitch. Since then, his work has been exhibited worldwide. His pho-\ntographs are held in numerous private and public collections, including those of the Corcoran\n\nGallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and The Museum of Modern Art, New York.

MILLER & CO.\n\nUta Barth: The Long Now\n\nText by Jonathan Crary, Russell Ferguson, Holly Myers.\n\nOften blurred or with only one element rendered sharply, clinging to the margin of the composition,\nUta Barth’s deceptively simple photographs of ordinary, ambiguous places are both elegant and chal-\nlenging. Walls, windows, patches of light on a rug, the glow of an out-of-focus glance toward the hori-\nzon: all these provoke phenomenological reflections on perception and subjectivity, often suspending\na viewer in the midst of the customary attempt to make sense of what is being seen, to reduce it to\nan accessible package of associations and meaning. “Certain expectations are unfulfilled: expecta-\ntions of what a photograph normally depicts, of how we are supposed to read the space in the image,\nof how a picture normally presents itself on the wall,” Barth has said. “This kind of questioning and\nreorientation is the point of entry and discovery, not only in a cognitive way, but in an almost visceral,\nphysical and personal sense.” This comprehensive monographic volume presents a definitive overview\nof Barth’s works, fully illustrated with more than 300 full-color reproductions, spanning from her earli-\nest photographs to her most recent. New texts by Russell Ferguson, former Chief Curator of the\nHammer Museum in Los Angeles; Holly Myers, art critic and writer; and renowned scholar Jonathan\nCrary provide critical perspectives on the work of this visionary artist.\n\nBorn in Berlin in 1958, and now resident in Los Angeles, Uta Barth is represented in the collections of\nThe Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, the Whitney, the\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the Tate in London.

Text by Oliva Maria Rubio, Vicenzo Vitiello,\nHubertus von Amenluxen, Hattula Moholy-Nagy, Frans Peterse, Oliver A.I.\nBotar, Jeanpaul Goergen.\n\nAn artist and thinker of astounding energy and ability, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy was a\ntrue world citizen of the early twentieth century, an ambassador-at-large for\nConstructivism, Suprematism, Dada and the Bauhaus. He brought the same\nConstructivist optimism to every medium he tackled, from plexiglass and light\nsculpture to typography to his photographic experiments in color to his Suprematist\ncanvases, his influential pedagogy at the Bauhaus and at the Institute of Design in\nChicago. Moholy-Nagy’s concept of the arts as a totality, his pedagogy and his confi-\ndence in the new industrial culture that would level distinctions between art and\ncraft led him into all fields of creative production. The ultimate “modernist\nRenaissance man,” Moholy-Nagy was prolific in so many realms that his detractors\ninevitably charged him with dilettantism. This accusation ignores his very real inno-\nvations in photography—for example his “photograms”—and light sculpture, as well\nas the fact that the artist’s aims possessed a conceptual unity in their common aspi-\nration to make an “art of light.” Lasz/d Moholy-Nagy: The Art of Light presents\nMoholy-Nagy’s work in all of its glorious unity and diversity. Including more than\n200 works, from painting, photography (black and white and color) and photograms\nto collages, films and graphic design, it emphasizes his greatest years of productivity,\nfrom 1922 to the end of his life. The Art of Light is the new definitive volume on this\nhero of modernism.\n\nLaszlé Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946) was born in Hungary, and moved to Berlin in 1920,\nwhere he taught at the Bauhaus for five years. After a spell in the U.K., he moved to\nAmerica, founding the School of Design in Chicago, which became the Illinois\nInstitute of Technology, in 1939.

German and American films competed on the world market,\nand the stylistic accomplishments of the many German film artists who emigrated to Hollywood before\nHitler took power deeply affected American cinema. Weimar Cinema is the first comprehensive survey of\nthis period to include popular films—musicals, comedies, the “daydreams” of the working class—along with\nthe “nightmarish” classics such as Fritz Lang’s Dr. Mabuse der Spieler and M; FW. Murnau’s Nosferatu, eine\nSymphonie des Grauens; and GW. Pabst’s Pandora's Box. Richly illustrated with film stills, the book examines\nhow and why our understanding of these films has changed in the last half century, and investigates impor-\ntant themes in films from this period, including the portrayal of women and the role of sound.\nSupplementing the essays is a detailed illustrated filmography of the 75 films featured in the exhibition;\neach film is accompanied by a brief description and excerpts from contemporaneous reviews.\n\nWeimar Cinema 1919-1933\nISBN 978-0-87070-761-2\nPbk, 8 x 10 in. / 216 pgs / 150 duotone. i\nU.S. $39.95 CDN $48.00\n\nNovember/Film & Video\n\nExhibition Schedule\nNew York: The Museum of Modern Art, 11/10-02/11\n\nThe Weimar era saw the birth of Expressionism and\nthe transition to sound cinema, and produced such\nmasterpieces as Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr.\nCaligari, FW.

Vollmann, Frederick Wiseman.\n\nFor over four decades, from his landmark Titicut Follies (1967) to his\nrecent La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet (2009) and forthcoming Boxing\nGym (2010), Frederick Wiseman (born 1930) has used a lightweight\n16mm camera and portable sound equipment to study human behav-\nior in all its unpredictable manifestations, particularly as it responds\nto institutional or regimented settings or to democracy at work.\nCombining epic narrative with intimate portraiture, Wiseman’s films\nconstitute a grand panorama of modern life, a kind of modern-day\ncomédie humaine. While he manages to intrude only minimally on the\nlives of his subjects, his sensitive eye, lawyerly skepticism and story-\ntelling impulses produce imaginative truth. Wiseman has also worked\nin the theater, directing acclaimed adaptations of Beckett and\nPirandello. His stage and film productions La Derniére Lettre (The Last\nLetter), based on Vassily Grossman's epic novel Life and Fate, starred\nCatherine Samie, doyenne of the Comédie-Frangaise and a contributor\nto this book. Frederick Wiseman, the first publication in English to pro-\nvide a comprehensive overview of Wiseman’s career to date, includes\nessays by eminent observers on both sides of the Atlantic, including\nwriters, critics, filmmakers, actors and Wiseman himself. Illustrated\nwith stills from his films, this volume offers a compelling portrait of\nFrederick Wiseman as one of the world’s most innovative, fearless and\ninfluential filmmakers, as well as an accomplished theater director.\nFrederick Wiseman has made 38 films that stand as a monumental\nchronicle of late-twentieth-century institutional and cultural life. His\ncontroversial 1967 debut feature Titicut Follies, a look at conditions\ninside the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane,\nremains the only American film ever censored for reasons other than\nnational security or obscenity. His 2009 film La Danse: The Paris Opera\nBallet has been a tremendous critical and popular success both in the\nUnited States and abroad. Wiseman’s latest documentary, about an\namateur boxing gym in Austin, Texas, had its premiere at the 2010\nCannes Film Festival, and he is currently editing a film about the Crazy\nHorse Saloon, the legendary cabaret in Paris.\n\nFrederick Wiseman\n\nISBN 978-0-87070-791-9\n\nPbk, 9 x 8.25 in. / 160 pgs / 65 duotone.\n\nU.S. $39.95 CDN $48.00\n\nSeptember/Film & Video\n\nExhibition Schedule\nNew York: The Museum of Modern Art, 01/20/10-12/31/10\n\nFrederick Wiseman: A Selective Filmography.\n\nTiticut Follies (1967) * High School (1968)\n\nBasic Training (1971) ¢ Juvenile Court (1973)\nPrimate (1974) « Meat (1976) « Manoeuvre (1979)\nModel (1980) ¢ Missile (1987) ¢ Central Park (1989)\nBallet (1995) * Domestic Violence (2001)\n\nLa Derniére Lettre (The Last Letter) (2002)\n\nLa Danse—The Paris Opera Ballet (2009)\n\nTim Hetherington: Infidel\nIntroduction by Sebastian Junger.\nInfidel is an intimate portrait of a single\n\nU.S. platoon, assigned to an outpost in the\nKorengal Valley—an area considered one of\nthe most dangerous Afghan postings in the\nwar against the Taliban—but it is as much\nabout love and male vulnerability as it is\nabout bravery and war. Embedded with\nwriter Sebastian Junger, and shooting over\nthe course of one year, photographer Tim\nHetherington made a series of images\n\nthat prove surprisingly tender in their\ndepiction of camaraderie and vulnerability\n(among the most moving is a series of the\nplatoon sleeping). Alongside revealing\ninterviews with Hetherington’s subjects\nand an introduction by Junger (with\n\nwhom Hetherington co-directed the\naward-winning film Restrepo, about the\nwork of the battalion), the book is also\nillustrated with graphics of the tattoos the\nsoldiers gave each other in the camp.\n\nThe title Infidel is taken from the tattoo\nthe men adopted as a badge of their\ncomradeship. Warm, moving and full of\nhumor, this book is a tribute to the “rough\nmen ready to do violence on our behalf”\nand a provocative contribution to the\ndocumentation of war in our time.\n\nTim Hetherington was born in Liverpool,\nU.K., and took up photojournalism after\nstudying literature at Oxford University.\nFive years spent living in Liberia resulted in\nthe book Long Story Bit By Bit: Liberia Retold\n(2009), and awards for his photojournalism\ninclude World Press Photo of the Year 2007\n(for his dramatic war photography from\nAfghanistan).

The\nfantastically colorful costumes specific to African and Caribbean rituals\nand celebrations go several steps further, transforming ordinary people\ninto mythic figures and magicians, tricksters and gods, and symbolizing\nthe roles their wearers play in the ancient dramas that form the corner-\nstones of their cultural heritage. Phyllis Galembo began photographing\nthe characters and costumes of African masquerade in Nigeria in 1985, and\nsince then she has continued developing her theme throughout Africa and\nthe Caribbean. This volume collects 108 thrilling carnival photographs\nfrom Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Zambia and Haiti. In\nmagnificent color shots, Galembo’s subjects pose in striped bodysuits that\ncover the entire body, including the face; or outfits made entirely of\nbunched greenery; or a lacquered wooden mask topped with a headdress\nfeaturing full-body models of other characters; or an oversize misshapen\nanimal head and plywood wings. The carnival characters, rooted in African\nreligion and spirituality, are presented in chapters organized by tribal or\ncarnival tradition and are accompanied by Galembo's personal commen-\ntary, shedding light on the characters and costumes portrayed, and on the\nevents in which they play a pivotal role.

In 2009, Bialobrzeski shot in Kliptown, a poverty-stricken suburb\nof Soweto less than ten miles away from a glistening new soccer stadium\nbuilt for the 2010 World Cup. The area’s resonance as a symbol of the vast\ndiscrepancies of wealth and status that persist in present-day South Africa—\nrepresenting, as the South African newspaper The Citizen put it, “the dashed\nhopes and broken dreams of so many’—is unmistakable, and Kliptown has a\nlarger historical significance: it was here, in 1955, that members of the anti-\napartheid movement drew up the Freedom Charter, a guiding document for\nthe ANC that today forms a foundation of the South African constitution. The\nlives of the inhabitants of these informal settlements have scarcely improved\nin the past 50 years, yet the Kliptownians arrange their homes as comfortably\nas they can, given what is available to them.

Culture, unlike race, is not quite an inevitability\nof birth, but ultimately, in its choice of statements, an intellectual\nposition. Today culture has a powerful new vector: the internet.\nIdeas—from a YouTube video to a viral marketing phenomenon or\n\na fundamentalist religion—are traveling further and faster, and\nchanging the cultural landscape like never before. In a new electronic\ndemocracy of ideas, cultural power is devolving to the creative\nindividual.

As the authors of this clear-eyed mani-\nfesto argue, sustainism “marks a shift not only in thinking and doing but\nin collective perception—of how we live, do business, feed ourselves,\ndesign, travel and communicate, as much as how we deal with nature.” In\nthe twentieth century, whether we knew it or not, our world was shaped\nby modernist values, from the design of our cities to our homes, technolo-\ngies and our conceptions of progress. Sustainism recasts our relationship\nto all of these things, binding ecological issues to a larger picture of our\nworld. Through a series of graphically dynamic aphorisms, quotes and\nsymbols designed for worldwide use by businesses, individuals and insti-\ntutions, to signal support for sustainism, Michiel Schwarz and Joost Elffers\nshow how the movement is already reshaping global culture, technology,\nfood and media. With this concise manifesto, they launch the term sus-\ntainism into the public consciousness. The sustainist era has begun.\nMichiel Schwarz is a Dutch independent cultural thinker, innovator and\nproducer, now working from Berkeley, California.

Thousands of Americans own purebred show\ndogs, and year round, local kennel clubs host events at which\njudges evaluate how closely individual dogs conform to breed\nstandard. Ribbons and trophies are bestowed and points are\naccumulated. The ultimate event in a show dog's life is\nWestminster—held in New York every year since 1877—which\nattracts hordes of visitors and an international media bonanza.\nIn 2005 Life magazine assigned photographer Kate Lacey to\ncover Westminster. She decided that instead of documenting\n\nthe scene, she would rig up a seamless backdrop to make elegant\nportraits, much as Richard Avedon once captured glamorous\ncelebrities. Though partial to poodle mutt mixes herself, on this\nassignment Kate became entranced by show dogs, and their\nexquisite grooming and acclimatization to attention made\n\nthem ready subjects. After the assignment ended, she continued\ntraveling to dog shows in a quest to photograph every one of\nthe AKC-recognized breeds. Some of the dogs in Show Dogs are\nveterans of years of shows, some are champions and some are\njust puppies; but their achievements in the ring are not the\npoint. With each portrait you'll just see the nickname given by\nthe people who love them, not their official championship names,\nwhich convey their titles and lineage.

The book is structured\n\nas a dictionary, but an unusual one: Each entry—for words including\n“armor,” “brash,” “comfortable,” “conformist,” “diaphanous,”\n“fashionable,” “loose,” “measured,” “plain,” “provocative,”\nsharp,” “tight” and so on—is elucidated by a litany of\nhighly unconventional definitions. “Loose,” for example, is “defined”\nas “1. Never knowingly over-attached; a disappearing act. 2.A\nmoveable feast; not conforming to contour or arrangement; subject\nto influence and gravity; seeking direction. 3. Of uncertain boundary.”\nPhillips’ entries in The Concise Dictionary of Dress are paired with\nphotographs of installations that Clark created among the rolling\nracks, rambling corridors and high-security vaults of the Victoria &\nAlbert Museum's vast reserve collections at Blythe House in west\nLondon. Cast objects and photographs, tableaux of clothing and\naccessories and metaphors of repression and ceremony continue\nthe conversation. Phillips said that viewing the works at Blythe\nHouse is “like looking up a word in a dictionary and finding a picture\ninstead of more words; it is not clear whether the word and its\ndefinition are the caption, or vice versa.”\n\nJudith Clark is Reader in the field of Fashion and Museology at\nLondon College of Fashion, where she is Director (with Amy de la\nHaye) of M.A. Fashion Curation.

That crucifix jewelry! Those earrings! Those black rubber\nbracelets! The accessories that gave Madonna her stylistic edge and sparked millions of\nprepubescent copycats across the globe were the brainchild of Maripol, a designer and\nstylist who was working at the time as the art director of the Fiorucci store. “I was\nattracted by objects and | liked to use them by taking away their original meaning,”\nMaripol has said. “| would see something | liked and I'd say, ‘That would be great as an\nearring.” An habitué of the same New York dance clubs as the singer, Maripol styled\nMadonna at the outset of the Material Girl’s career, both casually and also officially,\n\non the Like a Virgin album cover, ensuring the singer an eternal spot in the pantheon of\npop style icons. “I was already making the rubber jewelry and | was already making the\n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\ncrosses because of my love for the punks,” she said. “So it was perfect for her.” Now\nMaripol, who has just launched a new line of colorful, affordable accessories for Marc\nJacobs, opens up her scrapbooks of drawings, designs, photography and writing to create\na book that captures her personality as an artist, beginning with her childhood and her\narrival in New York as a 19-year-old art school student.\n\nMaripol moved to New York from France in 1976, where she became a part of the\n\nNew York clubbing and music scene, styling Madonna and working on films such as\nDowntown 81 (starring Jean-Michel Basquiat and Deborah Harry). In the mid-1980s, she\nopened her own boutique, Maripolitan, in the NoHo area of New York.

    "Page_25": "Hedi Slimane: Anthology of a Decade\n\nIn a 2003 conversation with then-/nterview magazine editor Ingrid Sischy,\nFrench designer Hedi Slimane (born 1968) described his beginnings as a\nphotographer: “I started taking pictures before | even began in fashion. | didn’t\nstart with clothes until | was 16, but | had my first camera when | was 11. I’ve\nalways taken pictures, almost like some people take notes or write down\n\ntheir thoughts.” As Hedi Slimane: Anthology of a Decade reveals, Slimane’s\nphotographs, which traverse the music scene, the New York art scene, street\nfashion and haute couture, are as fresh as his groundbreaking work in fashion.\nDrawing on photographs taken throughout the past decade, this volume\nrecords Slimane’s early years in the fashion industry, before, during and after\nhis tenures at Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior. It was during this decade\nthat Slimane brought to men’s fashion an androgynous, rock verve that\ninfluenced couture worldwide. This selection of 175 color photographs lays\nbare Slimane’s inspirations for this look, evidencing his attention to both youth\nculture and more historical groundings in photography; in their composition,\nthese pictures also affirm that the designer’s major contribution to contempo-\nrary haute couture has been his continual refinement of line and silhouette.\nAnthology of a Decade is revelatory both as a hitherto little-known instance\n\nof Slimane’s many talents, and as an elucidation of his work in fashion.\n\nHedi Slimane (born 1968) was educated in Paris as a political scientist, art\nhistorian and as a tailor. From 1992 to 1995 he worked for Jean-Jacques Picart,\nand in 1997 he was appointed Collections and Art Director at Yves Saint-\nLaurent. Slimane moved to Dior in 2000, winning much acclaim for his Dior\nfragrances and skincare lines. In 2008 he moved to the U.S., and began to\nexhibit his art, and to collaborate with artists and musicians in New York.\n\nHedi Slimane: Anthology of a Decade\nISBN 978-3-03764-115-6\n\nPbk, 8.5 x 11.25 in. / 240 pgs / 175 color.\nU.S. $95.00 CDN $114.00\nNovember/Fashion/Photography\n\n \n\nAlso Available:\n\n| Hedi Slimane: Intermission\n\n9788881583744\n| Hbk, U.S. $70.00 CDN $84.00\nCharta\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFashion Magazine by Paolo Pellegrin\n\nNumber 5\n\nEach issue of Fashion Magazine is given over to the work of a single photographer; to date, Bruce Gilden, Martin\nParr, Lise Sarfati and Alec Soth have all created acclaimed and instantly collectible editions of the magazine.

In fact, it was amid the foment of the\nLos Angeles punk and hardcore scene of the late\n1970s that Pettibon’s marvelous pen-and-ink\ndrawings first found their audience: he was\nclosely associated with Black Flag and the SST\nrecord label, designing album covers and logos\nfor Black Flag (and later for The Minutemen\n\nand Sonic Youth) and releasing many books\n\nof drawings—now extremely sought after—\nthrough SST. Although Pettibon’s art preceded\nthe birth of the LA. punk scene by a few years,\nhis conjunctions of blackly humorous text and\nimage were well suited to the themes and the\niconography of that movement.

Gaethgens.\n\nParallel to the film career for which he is justly admired, David Lynch (born\n1946) has always worked as an artist, having trained in painting at the\nCorcoran School of Art and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston\nin the mid-1960s. Lynch’s photographs, paintings, prints, drawings, and more\nrecently, musical compositions, are an indispensable part of his oeuvre and\nfrequently a source of inspiration for his films. Fans of such classics as Blue\nVelvet, Wild at Heart, Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive will readily conjure\nthe director's keen eye for lush but menacing neo-Surrealist tableaux, for\ninstance, which are directly nourished by his artworks. Other hallmarks of\nthe Lynchian style, such as cryptic messages and inscriptions, foreboding\natmospherics and a famously left-field sense of humor likewise appear in\nthe paintings, drawings and photographs collected in David Lynch: Dark\nSplendor—a landmark publication that reveals the breadth and accomplish-\nment of his work in this realm. It contains such marvels as his matchbook\ndrawings—pen-and-ink images of shrouded dreamscapes and interiors,\ninscribed on the inside of matchbooks—his wonderfully foreboding\nlithographs, in which scrawled captions jostle among murky figures, his\nphotographs of industrial wastelands and his sinister paintings that incorpo-\nrate materials and objects to further advance their gothic appeal. Dark\nSplendor presents these works in excellent reproductions, and will seduce\nfans of contemporary film and art alike.\n\nDavid Lynch: Dark Splendor\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2644-3\n\nHbk, 12.25 x 9.75 in. / 356 pgs / 346 color.\nU.S. $85.00 CDFN $102.00\nOctober/Art/Film & Video\n\n \n\n \n\nHATJE CANTZ\n\nDavid Lynch: Lithos\n\nText by Patrice Forest, Dominique Paini.\n\nThe workshop of Item Editions is sequestered in a back courtyard off the Rue du\nMontparnasse in Paris, where artists from all around the world have lithographs\nmade on Solnhofener stones. Here, with the help of the historic presses that\nhave printed masterworks by such artists as Picasso, Matisse and Mir6, a durable\nartistic continues today. Filmmaker, photographer, painter and printmaker David\nLynch (born 1946) was captivated by this place and its history, when he first\nchanced across it in 2007: “I fell in love,” he declared. Since his earliest experi-\nments with zinc plates and prints in black and red, Lynch has continued to labor\naway at Item Editions, recently producing large black-and-white lithographs by\ndrawing directly onto the stone (rather than using the medium to create multi-\nples of pre-existing drawings), experimenting with textures to draw figurative\nimagery out of abstract patterns, and adding captions to further elucidate their\nthemes. The content of these lithographs clusters around themes familiar to\nLynch fans: love, eroticism, dreams and death. David Lynch: Lithos collects all of\nLynch's work in this genre. A conversation between Dominique Paini, former\ndirector of the French Cinematheque and Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and\nthe artist, provides further insight into Lynch's process.\n\nDavid Lynch: Lithos\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2673-3\n\nHbk, 12.25 x 9.75 in. / 160 pgs / 100 color.\nU.S. $60.00 CDN $72.00\nOctober/Art/Film & Video\n\nwww.artbook.com | 55\n\n(@)\nm\nra\nm\nva\noa\n=\nra\naoa\nm\naA\nm\nW\naT",

Afterword by Julian Schnabel.\n\nAmerican art megastar Julian Schnabel (born 1951) has made a métier of both painting and film, and while\nhe is equally acclaimed for his achievements in each of these disciplines, the works have often been kept\nseparate in the public eye. Yet Schnabel’s painting has drawn on cinematic imagery for years, often con-\nnecting otherwise disparate work via this theme, and his award-winning films have drawn on art both for-\nmally and as subject matter—most famously in the 1996 hit Basquiat. Schnabel himself resists categoriza-\ntion: “I make art,” he says, “whether it is painting, writing, photography or making a movie.” This survey of\nSchnabel’s career to date presents the artist's painterly production, from the 1970s through to the present,\njuxtaposing his large-scale paintings with his numerous critically acclaimed movies—Basquiat (1996),\nBefore Night Falls (2000), The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007) and his newest film Miral, which address-\nes the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The complete scripts of each of these movies are featured, punctuated\nwith stills chosen by Schnabel. Published for the Art Gallery of Ontario's 2010 survey, Julian Schnabel: Art\nand Film is the first appraisal of how Schnabel works across media, bridging painting, writing and cinema.\nJulian Schnabel was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. His first solo show was at the Contemporary\nArts Museum in Houston in 1976, but it was with his 1979 exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery in New\nYork that Schnabel first asserted his presence as a figurehead for new possibilities in painting.\nRetrospectives of his work have been mounted by Tate Gallery, London (1983), the Whitney Museum of\nAmerican Art (1987), and Museo Nacionale Centro de Arte Reina Sophia, Madrid (2004), among many oth-\ners. He made his cinematic debut in 1996 with his account of the life of Jean-Michel Basquiat, which\nstarred Jeffrey Wright, David Bowie, Gary Oldman and Dennis Hopper. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\nearned him Best Director both at the Cannes Film Festival and the Golden Globes, and an Academy Award\nnomination in this same category.\n\nJulian Schnabel: Art and Film\n\nISBN 978-1-894243-66-7\n\nPbk, 7 x 10 in. / 368 pgs / 50 color / 80 b&w.\nU.S. $40.00 CDN $48.00\n\nSeptember/Art\n\nExhibition Schedule\nToronto, Ontario: Art Gallery of Ontario, 09/01/10-01/02/1\n\n \n\nEvery day | make art,\nwhether it is painting,\nwriting or making a\nmovie.\n\n—Julian Schnabel.\n\n \n\nwww.artbook.com | 57",

Over the past decade and a half, Templeton has built an oeuvre & a\n\nthat closely tracks his day-to-day reality, recording life in the Southern Californian suburbs, {| |\nhis flawed family background, his life as a professional skateboarder, his milieu, the rela-\ntionship between the artist and his muse (his wife Deanna) and much else. Templeton has\nalso drawn deeply on artists such as Egon Schiele, Balthus, David Hockney, Larry Clark and\nNan Goldin; as with their work, what begins as a very personal chronicle ultimately opens\nout onto grander horizons—in Templeton’s case, a broad meditation on the chaos and the\njoy of being human.

In another image, a sleek\ngentleman who might otherwise be debonair becomes fearsome and fierce with the addition of a pat-\ntern of contoured lines, like Aztec facial tattoos, over his entire face. This is the work of Mexican artist Dr.\nLakra, who superimposes mystical, ancient or funerary symbolism—gang tattoos, bones and skulls, Aztec\nwarrior heads, spider webs, serpents and demons—onto vintage advertisements, girlie pinups, Japanese\nprints, baby dolls, cast skulls and the like, attaining an effect that resembles a Dia de los Muertos altar\nslyly erected in place of a kitchen table in the home furnishings section of a Mexico City department\nstore. “In one way or another, the noncivilized human, the nonrefined, the primitive, is always being\nrepressed, in a way that’s almost criminal,” Dr. Lakra, who also works as a tattoo artist, has said. “I think\nthat through these themes you can define the essence of culture.” This lavishly illustrated volume con-\ntains 120 color images of Lakra’s work, plus a contribution from renowned Mexican artist Gabriel Orozco.\nBorn Jeronimo Lopez Ramirez in 1972, Dr Lakra is an artist and tattooist based in Oaxaca, Mexico.

Founded, designed and published by the English designer John Sutcliffe as a platform\nfor his extraordinary talents as “a manufacturer of weatherproofs for lady pillion riders,” it quickly\nbecame a rallying point for explorers of every kind of fledgling clothing scene, functioning as both an\ninstruction manual and a mirror. The experimental clothing showcased in its pages, including items |\n\n:\nmade by the readers themselves, transformed a passion for a sexual proclivity into a cult phenomenon.\nDRESSING FOR PLEASURE\n\nFrom motorbiking and mask-wearing, to mudlarking and wading worship, Atomage covered every\n7 °\n\ncs\n: -\n\nconceivable variant on and use for fetish wear. The amateur photographs reproduced here reflect a\ngolden age of DIY enthusiasm, before fetish became the industry it is today, and inadvertently depict\na suburbia from which dressing for pleasure was a necessary escape. The outrageous costumes found\nin Atomage also served as inspiration to a then-new generation of fashion designers such as Vivienne\nWestwood, and many of these costumes have since been acquired by high-end collections. Compiling\nthe most astonishing imagery from all 32 issues of this now extremely rare and sought after cult\nmagazine, Dressing for Pleasure illustrates not just Sutcliffe’s exceptional designs, but also, through Pi ideale\ntheir own photography and writings, the fantasies and desires of the Atomage followers.\n\nui eee at oe |\n\nDressing for Pleasure in Rubber, Vinyl & Leather\nISBN 978-0-9563562-3-9\n\nHbk, 5.5 x 8.25 in. / 208 pgs / 150 color / 10 b&w.\nU.S. $32.95 CDN $40.00\n\nOctober/Fashion\n\n60 | D.A.P. | 1:800.338.2665 F:800.478.3128\n\n  \n\n    \n\nT9ST-3S7 6 MOCCGRDE NINADMITBARWE MEHWWHSBPAIOS HAPODA a TAPOXOMETORLTNPH STARE (MPT BAHBHO-BYXTA HAY AEROS MAL ALAN)\n\n  \n\nONS Sale\n\nATUMIBMMN AMM, HACMMOSANMM CTAPEIC HM NOAODBIX.

Baldaev's father, a respected ethnographer,\ntaught him techniques to record the tattoos of criminals in St. Petersburg’s notorious Kresty\nprison, where Danzig worked as a guard. He was reported to the K.G.B. who unexpectedly\noffered support for his work, allowing him the opportunity to travel across the former U.S.S.R.\nWitnessing scenes of everyday life in the Gulag, he chronicled this previously closed world\nfrom both sides of the wire. With every vignette, Baldaev brings the characters he depicts\n\nto vivid life: from the lowest “zek” (inmate) to the most violent tattooed “vor” (thief), all the\npractices and inhabitants of the Gulag system are depicted here in incredible and often\nshocking detail. In documenting the attitude of the authorities to those imprisoned, and the\ntransformation of these citizens into survivors or victims of the Gulag system, this graphic\nnovel vividly depicts methods of torture and mass murder undertaken by the administration,\nas well as the atrocities committed by criminals upon their fellow inmates.\n\nDanzig Baldaev was born in 1925 in Ulan-Ude, Buryatiya, Russia. In 1948, after serving in the\narmy in World War Il, he was ordered by the N.K.V.D. to work as a warden in the infamous\nLeningrad prison, Kresty, where he started drawing the tattoos of criminals.

Illustrations by Thibaud Herem.\n\nInsects, fishes, birds: London-based French illustrator Thibaud Herem has made charming books devoted\nto these facets of the animal kingdom, depicting standout species in whimsical, personable drawings,\nrendered simply in black ink and watercolor. In his work, each animal displays its characteristic traits while\nalso looking for all the world like it might turn and start speaking to the viewer at any moment. For his\nnext book, it was only natural that Herem would move up another rung on the evolutionary ladder to those\nmost lowly and mistrusted of mammals: rodents. Yet Know Your Rodent just may change a few people's\nminds about the furry creatures. It turns out that there’s a lot more to rodents than subway rats, kitchen\nmice and the ubiquitous short-lived childhood gerbil. Out of the thousands of rodent species that scamper\nover nearly every habitat on earth, Herem has picked 20 distinctive varieties to depict here, from the giant\nCapybara of South America to the tiny Pygmy Jerboa of the Asian deserts. Factual texts describe the weird\nand wonderful habits of each creature, while Herem’s illustrations bring the animals alive on the page. At\nonce fascinatingly informative and oddly humorous, this offbeat little book brings together the marvels of\nnature and the marvels of beautiful design in a way that will appeal to adults and children alike.\n\nKnow Your Rodent\n\nISBN 978-0-9562053-1-5\n\nClth, 4.75 x 6.5 in. / 48 pgs / 28 color.\nU.S. $13.99 CDN $17.00\nJuly/Nature/Popular Culture\n\nJ&L BOOKS\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJason Logan: Festus\n\nIn Festus, Canadian artist and illustrator Jason\nLogan depicts the classic figure of the frontiers-\nman in various incarnations.

Until the First World\nWar, photography had largely followed the aesthet-\nics of painting; during and after the war, such\nmovements as Constructivism, Moholy-Nagy’s\nNew Vision and Surrealism led photography to\nnew frontiers, developing techniques and styles\nthat took the medium strictly on its own terms.\nDemonstrating the interconnectedness of these\ntendencies, this volume assesses the contributions\nof each of these cities. Photographers based in\nParis during these years include Man Ray, Brassai,\nEmmanuel Sougez, Hans Bellmer, Jacques-André\nBoiffard, Germaine Krull, André Kertész, Francois\nCollar, Claude Cahun, Florence Henri, Andreas\nFeininger, Eli Lotar, Dora Maar, Roger Parry and Raul\nUbac; in Prague, Josef Sudek, Frantisek Drtikol,\nJaroslav Réssler, Eugen Wiskovsk, Jaromir Funke,\nKarel Teige, Ladislav Berka, Jan Lauschmann, Josef\nBartuska, Jindrich Styrsky and Karel Kasparik; and\nin Barcelona, Pere Catala Pic, Josep Masana, Josep\nSala, Josep Llad6, Emili Godes, Antoni Arissa,\nGabriel Casas, Salvador Dali and Joaquim Gomis.\n\nPraha, Paris, Barcelona\n\nISBN 978-84-92841-02-8\n\nHbk, g x 10.75 in. / 250 pgs / color.\nU.S. $70.00 CDN $84.00\nAugust/Photography\n\nExhibition Schedule:\nBarcelona: Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya,\n05/10-09/10\n\n \n\nHATJE CANTZ\n\n \n\nFrantisek Drtikol\n\nEdited by Annette Kicken, Rudolf Kicken.\n\nText by Anna Farova, Vladimir Birgus.\n\nCzech photographer Frantisek Drtikol (1883-1961)\nreinvented the genre of nude photography for the\nearly twentieth century. Drtikol opened his Prague\nstudio in 1907, and his nudes from this early period\nconvey the dreamy eroticism of Art Nouveau and\nthe foreboding accents of Prague Symbolism that\n\nhe was to return to throughout his somewhat brief\ncareer (Drtikol abandoned photography for painting\nin 1935, and it was not until curator Anna Farova’s\nnow legendary 1972 Prague exhibition that this work\nwas rediscovered by a broader public). But Drtikol\nquickly absorbed into his photography the myriad\nnew idioms of the interbellum years, and freighted\nhis nudes with the dramatic lighting of silent\n\nfilm and the more austere geometric effects and\ndynamic poses of Futurism, Cubism and Bauhaus.\nSurveying his daring and expressive nudes of the\n1920s and 19305, this important publication charts\nDrtikol’s adventurous treatments of the nude as they\nevolved in their quirky conversation with modernist\ninnovations—from the early nymphs and femme\nfatales to more abstracted studies that dramatize\nlight and kinetic qualities. This smartly conceived vol-\nume confirms Drtikol’s place as one of the greatest\nphotographers of the early twentieth century.\n\nFrantisek Drtikol\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2600-9\n\nHbk, 9.5 x 12.25 in. / 96 pgs / 60 color.\nU.S. $55.00 CDN $66.00\nOctober/Photography\n\nAlso Available:\n\nFrantisek Drtikol: Portraits\n9788072153015\n\nPbk, U.S. $25.00 CDN $30.00\nTorst\n\nHATJE CANTZ\n\n \n\nHeinrich Kiihn: Perfect\nPhotography\n\nText by Monika Faber, Astrid Mahler.\n\nGerman scientist and photographer Heinrich Kuhn\n(1866-1944) was one of the central figures in the\nestablishment of international art photography at\nthe turn of the twentieth century. Having studied\nbotany and medicine, Kihn made his first photo-\ngraph in the late 1870s, dedicating himself solely\nto the medium within a decade. He achieved\n\nthis dedication through the support of American\nphotographers Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen\nand others. After a meeting in 1904, Stieglitz\n\nand Kihn initiated an almost 30-year-long\ncorrespondence, ushering in an era of pioneering\nexperimentation with autochrome and other\nphotographic processes. Critical to Kiihn’s success\nwas an offset process he perfected, which allowed\nhim to deliberately dissolve the sharpness of the\nimage and alter its brightness. The results are\ngorgeous, dreamy images full of rich, delicate\ncolor. Around 1910, Kuhn reduced the romantic\ncosmos of Pictorialism to the point where his\ncompositions became almost abstract, so that\nonly the study of light and the rendering of tonal\nvalues mattered. He later returned to exploring\nthe photograph as objective record, concentrating\nmainly on writing and to experiments in photo-\ngraphic technology. This landmark volume surveys\nthe works of a revelatory photographer.\n\nHeinrich Kiihn: Perfect Photography\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2569-9\n\nHbk, 9.75 x 11.75 in. / 288 pgs / 160 color / 70 b&w.\nU.S. $70.00 CDN $84.00\n\nOctober/Photography\n\nExhibition Schedule\n\nVienna: Albertina, 06/09/10-09/05/10\n\nParis: Musée d’Orsay, 10/10/10-01/23/11\n\nHouston: Museum of Fine Arts, 03/06/11-05/29/11\n\nwww.artbook.com | 69\n\n=\na\nPa\n=\nae\na)\na\nit\na)\na\ncoal\nWN\n\n \n\nAHdVaDOLOHd",

Preface by Gregory Crewdson. Text by\nJames Ellroy, Neville Wakefield, A.M. Homes, James Frey, Bruce\nWagner. Interview with Philip-Lorca diCorcia.\n\nAseminal experience for American photographer Malerie Marder (born\n1971) was a family friend’s request for Marder to photograph her with her\nlover, naked and in the anonymous setting of a motel room. This set the\ntone for Marder’s work for the next decade. Her photographs of nudes are\ncomposed simply, much like portrait painting, her subjects sitting plainly\nnear the center of the frame, often set against the bleak anonymity of\nmotel rooms, their impassive gazes almost daring the viewer to interpret\ntheir bodies. “Marder has explored the psychosexual undertow of her own\nintimate relationships,” Siobhan McDevitt wrote in Artforum, “frequently\nshooting herself along with family and friends in close quarters (including\npay-by-the-hour motels) and, usually, undressed. She flirts with prurience,\nwith ideas of privacy and surveillance, eroticism and pornography, but\nseems more satisfied when approaching the complications of love or being\nin love.” Beautifully illustrated, Carnal Knowledge contains 77 color repro-\nductions of these photographs, as well as new texts from James Ellroy and\nNeville Wakefield, a preface by Gregory Crewdson, short stories inspired by\nMarder’s work by A. M. Homes, James Frey and Bruce Wagner, andaQ &A\nfor Marder devised by Philip-Lorca diCorcia.

A former assistant and friend\n\nof Helmut Newton’s, Loomis (born 1957) worked\nin the 1980s as a fashion photographer for maga-\nzines such as Harper's Bazaar and The New York\nTimes Magazine. Turning to portraiture and\ndocumentary photography in 1990, Loomis began\nto make portrait photographs, in both black and\nwhite and in color, that show a raw and affection-\nate view of everyday life in America: a waitress\nbehind a counter in a Hollywood diner, a young\ncouple exuding the bliss of early romance, or\nchildren caught in moments of play. From his\nearliest work through to this latest collection, the\nphotographer's first monograph, Loomis’ method\nhas been to insist on the value and beauty of\nwhat lies immediately to hand, and to locate the\nmoments that illuminate that fact for the viewer.\nAs June Newton states, “He understands these\npeople, as he comes from the same place.

He is internationally\nknown for the postmortem genre\nhe pioneered, photographs of the\ndead that shocked and repelled\neven as they fascinated.” Framed in\nstark and uncompromising compo-\nsitions, Silverthorne’s subjects\noften regard the viewer with a defi-\nant indifference; his work melds\nportraiture with a kind of detached\nphotodocumentary impulse a la\nDiane Arbus.

Photographer Jeffrey\nSilverthorne (born 1946), who has\nin the past made photographs of\nlandscapes, still lifes, portraits of\ntransvestites and of dead bodies\nin a morgue, photographed the\nwomen who sell their bodies\nnightly in the Mexican establish-\nments for wages that far exceed\nwhat they could earn in the local\nmaquiladoras. Lurid and unsettling,\nBoystown: The Perfume of Desire\npresents 56 color and 34 black-and-\nwhite images. “On a simplistic and\njuvenile level,” Silverthorne writes,\n“a Boystown is a celebration of\nlife, a candy store of flesh, with\nany psychological or medical\nconsequences deferred.

As Africa has begun to step beyond its\ncolonial subjugation, photography has also assumed a leading role in providing African coun-\ntries with individual identities.

In Our Own Image was the first book to address\n“the coming revolution in photography,” and asked pointed questions that\nare increasingly relevant today, including whether democracy can survive\n\nthe media's facile use of digital means. By the time a second edition was\npublished in 1999, many of Ritchin’s predictions had come true. Computer\nembellishment of imagery had become a staple in the media and had signifi-\ncantly diminished photography’s role as a credible witness: Newsday had\npublished the first “future” news photograph of two feuding ice skaters as\nthey would meet the next day, and on its cover, Time magazine darkened and\nblurred an image of O.J. Simpson in order to lift “a common police mug shot\nto the level of art, with no sacrifice to truth.” Now Aperture reissues this\nseminal text, which has continued to shape the debate about digital imaging\nsince its initial publication. This twentieth-anniversary edition features a pref-\nace by the author that contextualizes the book for a contemporary audience.\nFred Ritchin is Professor of Photography and Imaging at New York\nUniversity’s Tisch School of the Arts. He was picture editor of The New York\nTimes Magazine (1978-82) and the founding director of the Photojournalism\nand Documentary Photography Program at the International Center of\nPhotography (1983-86).

First published\n\nin 2005, Light Matters gathers a selection of this remarkable author's essays\nand criticism, culled from her writings published over the previous 25 years.\nGoldberg’s take on photography is both insightful and encompassing: her\nsubjects range from pop imagery to war journalism, from photo-booth\nportraits to manipulated digital imagery, from the “boredom” of voyeurism to\nthe great preponderance of tragic photographs in the news. She brings new\nlight to the work of the medium’s “old masters,” among them Walker Evans,\nLotte Jacobi and Lartigue, writing with equal acuity about contemporary\ntrailblazers such as Bill Viola, Daido Moriyama and Bastienne Schmidt.\nGoldberg also tackles provocative larger issues facing the medium, such\n\nas the potentially transgressive nature of photographs, and the camera’s\npowerful role in a culture of commodification. Dismissing clichés and deftly\nnegotiating the many diverging paths photography now follows, Goldberg\ndemonstrates how to consider not just photographic images themselves,\nbut their impact, and the meaning of that impact. Light Matters showcases\n\na writer of great intelligence, wit and insight, whose understanding of this\nmultifarious and evolving medium is unsurpassed.\n\nVicki Goldberg is the author of numerous books, including The Power of\nPhotography: How Photographs Changed Our Lives (1991).

Plastic Dreams:\nSynthetic Visions in Design tells the fascinating story of\nthese truly wondrous materials, charting their evolution\nfrom the mid-nineteenth century to the present, across a\nhuge range of landmark product types, from Wells Coates’\niconic AD 65 radio to Konstantin Grcic’s MYTO stacking\nchair, and from Bakelite in the 1920s to today’s latest\ntechno-polymers. A fully illustrated reference resource,\n\nthis volume raises our aesthetic perception of plastics\n\nand celebrates their nobility as materials. An introductory\nessay traces the fascinating history of plastics and assesses\ntheir decisive role in industrial design, while an extensive\nglossary of materials and processes will help the plastics\nneophyte distinguish their Jaxonite and Xylonite from their\npolyethylene and ABS. As a final design flourish, Plastic\nDreams comes with a specially designed orange plastic\nslipcase by Edson Matsuo of Melissa.\n\n \n\nNAI PUBLISHERS\n\nThonik: | Am Your Type\n\nText by Hugues Boekraad.\n\nFounded by Thomas Widdershoven and Nikki\nGonnissen, Thonik is an award-winning Dutch\ndesign studio specializing in visual communication\nthrough graphic design.

As Art Director of i-D and Creative\nDirector of Sleazenation magazines (for which\n\nhe was awarded “Best Cover” and “Best Designed\nFeature of the Year” prizes), King’s design work\n\nis already well-known around the world. As an\nartist, King plays fast and loose with twentieth-\ncentury icons: in “Brian,” for example, a viewer\nrecognizes at a glance Lenin’s familiar visage, with\nthe face turned sternly to the side, the moustache\nplumping his marblesque upper lip, but the face\non this white bust bears eye makeup and a hint\nof blush, and feathers sprout from the neck on\neither side.

The architect Josep\nLluis Sert designed the Foundation’s building with\nclean, airy white shapes of curves and corners and\nmultiple skylights, creating a decidedly\nMediterranean-flavored complex arranged\naround a central patio, with expansive roof ter-\nraces above. (Two subsequent expansions to the\nbuilding were designed by Jaume Freixa, a pupil\nand longtime colleague of Sert’s.) After the first\nmajor retrospective of Mirdé’s work occurred in\nBarcelona in 1968, the artist decided to set up a\nbuilding to make his work and the work of other\ncontemporary artists permanently accessible\n\nto the public. To design the foundation's home,\nhe tapped his old friend Sert, a pioneer in the\nintroduction of modern architecture in Catalonia,\nwho had first met Miré in 1932 and worked\n\nwith him on the Spanish (Republican) Pavilion\n\nat the Paris World Fair in 1937.

Foreword by Sir Nicholas Serota.\n\nBritish architect Richard Rogers has been described as the last humanist, a recognition of his\nambition to create public spaces that allow for the diversity and complexity of the contempo-\nrary world. This weighty monograph takes a look at the work of Rogers and his partners, from\nhis early career in the 1960s and 19705, to his famous collaboration with Renzo Piano on the\ndesign of the Pompidou Centre (1971-77), to numerous projects up to the present day, through\nhis architectural practice, Richard Rogers Partnership (now Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners).\nRogers and his team often deploy new materials and innovative techniques to build structures\nthat are lightweight, environmentally friendly and transparent; a signature strategy has been\nto expose those parts of a structure that have traditionally been concealed, such as water,\nheating and ventilation ducts, situating them instead on the outside of the building, leaving\nthe internal spaces uncluttered and open. In this book, projects executed by Richard Rogers and\nhis partners are presented in sections devoted to each of the architectural keywords that\ndefine his work: legible; transparent; lightweight; systems; green; urban; public; together with\nsections on both early work and work in progress.\n\nRichard Rogers (born 1933) attended the Architectural Association School of Architecture in\nLondon, and obtained his MA from the Yale School of Architecture in 1962. From early on in his\ncareer, Rogers pursued and thrived on collaboration, working with colleagues such as Norman\nFoster and Renzo Piano. It was with the latter that Rogers designed the building for which he is\nperhaps best known today, the Pompidou Center in Paris. In May 2006 Rogers’ practice was\n\n \n\nchosen to design the third tower of the new World Trade Center in New York.\n\nRichard Rogers + Architects: From the House to the City\nISBN 978-1-906863-11-1\n\nHbk, 8 x 10.25 in. / 272 pgs / illustrated throughout.\n\nU.S. $45.00 CDN $54.00\n\nAugust/Architecture & Urban Studies\n\nMy passion and great enjoyment for architecture, and the\n\nreason the older | get the more | enjoy it, is because | believe\n\nwe—architects—can affect the quality of life of the people.\n—Richard Rogers.\n\nGREGORY R.

Interviews by Kathan Brown,\nRay Kass, Laura Kuhn, Julie Lazar, Irving Sandler.\n\nOne of the twentieth century's most influential and iconoclastic\nprotagonists, John Cage (1912-1992) may be described not so much\nas a composer, artist and author, as a thinker who applied his ideas\nequivalently to sound, visual art and writing. As with his music, the\nuse of chance operations—in particular via the Chinese Book of\nChanges, or | Ching—was central to Cage’s approach to visual art,\ndetermining technique, the placement of forms and even tonal\nvalues. Every Day is a Good Day provides the first broad assessment\nof Cage’s art, and is fully illustrated with plates of his drawings,\nwatercolors and prints, including series such as Where R=Ryoanji\n(1983-92). Cage’s working methods and philosophies are brought\nto light in new interviews with key collaborators: printmaker and\nwriter Kathan Brown, founder of Crown Point Press; Laura Kuhn,\nLeft to itself art would have to Director of the John Cage Trust; artist Ray Kass; and Julie Lazar,\n\n. . . curator of Cage’s “composition for a museum,” Rolywholyover: A\n\nbe something very sim ple—it Circus.

Mellio, Rufus\nWainwright, Philip Glass, Marina Abramovic, Laurie Anderson, John Rockwell, et al.\n\nPerhaps the world’s foremost avant-garde theater artist, Robert Wilson (born 1941) ranges across\nopera, stage works, lighting design, video and even furniture design in his pursuit of astounding\ngesamtkunstwerk creations; Susan Sontag wrote of his career that “it has the signature of a major\nartistic creation. | can’t think of any body of work as large or as influential.” Among Wilson’s numer-\nous eminent collaborators are Tom Waits, William Burroughs and David Byrne. His legendary operatic\ncollaboration with composer Philip Glass, Einstein on the Beach, upended conventions of traditional\noperatic form, and he has also left his mark on masterworks from The Magic Flute to Pélleas et\nMelisande.

Based in Mexico City since 1986,\nthe artist fashions much of his work from the street life he\nobserves during long walks throughout the city. Bringing\ntogether a variety of participants, from Mexican sign-painters to\nBritish Guardsmen, his collaborations have produced several\nwell-known works, including “When Faith Moves Mountains”\n(2002), in which he enlisted 500 volunteers to attempt to move\na sand dune one foot from its original position using shovels,\nand “The Modern Procession” (2002), a ceremonial procession\ncommemorating MoMA’ temporary move to Queens, New York,\nthat included a brass band and uniformed participants carrying\nreproductions of the Museum's most famous works across\n\nthe Queensboro bridge. Published to accompany the largest\nretrospective of Alys’ work to date, this publication is more a\nguidebook than a conventional monograph, reflecting the spirit\nof the artist’s wandering practice.

From her\nbeginnings as a sculptor, and her emergence in\nthe New York art and performance scenes of the\n1960s and 70s (including the seminal “Vertical\nRoll” video piece of 1972, in which the titular\ntelevision malfunction enacted a memorably\nfractured female identity), up through her per-\nformance at the Performa 09 biennial and recent\ncollaborations with composer Alvin Lucier and the\navant-garde theater company The Wooster Group,\nher work has always been surprising, ground-\nbreaking and necessary. This extensively illustrated\nvolume, containing hundreds of full-color images,\npresents the definitive collection of Jonas’ work.\nThe first career-spanning monograph of the\nmultimedia pioneer, it covers more than 40 years\nof performances, films, videos, installations,\n\ntexts and video sculptures. In addition to docu-\nmentation of the artist’s crucial projects, In the\nShadow a Shadow includes individual essays by\nDouglas Crimp, Barbara Clausen and Johanna\nBurton, a major survey text by Joan Simon, and\nunpublished photographs and drawings from\nJonas’ archives.

Lee wrote in Artforum not\nlong ago, “his station in postwar art history rests\nsecure. His influence—whether through his\naffectless, task-based performances, his sculptural\ncastings of negative space, or his intermedia\nmash-ups of language, video and noise—is\neverywhere apparent in contemporary art.”\nIndeed, from the American artist's early work\n\nin sculpture and video, made in the 1960s,\nthrough his famous spiral of neon letters spelling\nout “the true artist helps the world by revealing\nmystic truths,” which at once summarized and\nopened to critique the perennial mystique of the\nartist, up through his three-venue Golden Lion\nAward-winning exhibition at the 2009 Venice\nBiennale, Nauman’s work has long been an\nindispensable part of the narrative of recent\nAmerican art. This essential volume, published\n\nin DuMont'’s fantastic Collector’s Choice series,\n\n \n\ntreats these and other recurrent themes of his\noeuvre, such as sound, language, corporeality\nand dance, reproducing works from across\n\nhis career and and providing a new standard\noverview of this ever-popular artist.\n\nBruce Nauman: Live or Die\n\nISBN 978-3-8321-9284-6\n\nHbk, g x 11.25 in. / 186 pgs / 180 color.\nU.S. $59.95 CDN $72.00\n\nAugust/Art\n\n \n\nPARSE\n\nsau batt\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJohn Baldessari: Parse\n\nEdited by Beatrix Ruf.\n\nJohn Baldessari (born 1931) is a luminary in the\nrealms of Conceptual art and book art, and one\nof the most important figures in contemporary\nart of the last 40 years. Since his sensational\nCremation Project of 1970, for which he incinerated\nevery single painting he had made between 1953\nand 1966, Baldessari’s work has mined the tensions\nbetween language, image and sign-making.\nBaldessari unpicks the very mechanisms of media\nrepresentation, and even the idea of artistic\nsubject matter itself, using painting, photography,\nfilm/video, collage and reliefs, integrating images\nand text from advertising and movies into his\nworks. Since 1980, Baldessari has worked mostly\nwithout text in serial photographs and pictures,\nand strategies such as overpainting, visual\nomissions and withheld information have\nincreasingly taken on the earlier function of\nlanguage. For this superbly designed book,\nBaldessari has designed a sequence of enigmati-\ncally fragmentary and geometrically emphatic\nimages, arranged rhythmically across the\nvolume’s landscape format, that slowly accrete\nnarrative as the reader-viewer moves through\nthe book. These fragments, derived largely from\nB-movie stills, lead into a second chapter that\nreproduces the “complete” pictures.

During this period,\nWarhol gradually replaced his some-\nwhat individualized visual language\nwith purely media-derived (and\ntherefore collective) subject matter,\nand developed the mechanical\npainting process of silkscreening on\ncanvas for which he became so well\nknown.

Not only was their\nimagery, culled from consumer cul-\nture, entirely new—baked potatoes,\nads for foot medication and BB\nGuns—but so was their treatment,\nwhich drew on the rudimentary\ncharacter of cheaply printed com-\nmercial drawings. Conceived inde-\npendently from Lichtenstein’s paint-\nings, these drawings recast illustra-\ntions from newspaper ads and\ncomic books into works of keen\nvisual intensity, curiously echoing\nthe clean-edge aesthetic of 1960s\ngeometric abstraction. “Drawing is\nthe basis of my art,” Lichtenstein\nlater affirmed; “It is where my think-\ning takes place.” Published for an\nexhibition at the Morgan Library\n\nin New York, this richly illustrated\npublication offers 120 color illustra-\ntions, plus essays on Lichtenstein’s\ntechnique and on his little-known\n1967 Aspen project, in which the\nartist transformed a room into a\nblack-and-white cartoon drawing.\n\nRoy Lichtenstein: The Black-and-\nWhite-Drawings 1961-1968\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2643-6\n\nHbk, 9.5 x 11.5 in. / 176 pgs / 150 col.\nU.S. $60.00 CDN $72.00\nDecember/Art\n\n \n\nExhibition Schedule\nNew York: The Morgan Library &\nMuseum, 09/24/10-01/08/11\n\nHATJE CANTZ\n\nAlex Katz\n\n   \n\n \n\nAlex Katz: Prints\n\nEdited by Klaus Albrecht\nSchréder.

In the\nearly 1950s, he began experiment-\ning with printmaking, but it was\nnot until the mid 1960s that he\nintensified his interest and produc-\ntion in the medium. Pushing at the\nlimits of various printing tech-\nniques, Katz tested out pictorial\nideas first conceived for his paint-\nings, retaining planes of matte color\nbut further simplifying his forms\nand dramatically cropping his\nimages. These reduced composi-\ntions were wonderfully compatible\nwith the graphic clarity of print-\nmaking, and by effectively translat-\ning his paintings into prints, the\nartist achieved what he called the\n“final synthesis of painting.” This\npublication provides insight into an\noften-neglected yet vital aspect of\nKatz’s work, from the early 1950s to\nthe present day.\n\nAlex Katz: Prints\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2585-9\n\nHbk, 9.5 x 11.75 in. / 192 pgs /\n153 color / 2 b&w.\n\nU.S. $60.00 CDN $72.00\nOctober/Art\n\nExhibition Schedule\nVienna: Albertina, 05/28/10-09/19/10\n\n \n\nKERBER\n\na GRIER\n\nSH bD) tO) Ae\n\n \n\nRobert Rauschenberg\n& Jean Tinguely:\nCollaborations\n\nEdited by Roland Wetzel, Mari\nDumett, Manuela Kraft, Heinz\nStahlhut, Jean-Paul Ameline.\nOver the course of his entire career,\nRobert Rauschenberg dedicated\nworks to only five other artists: John\nCage, Merce Cunningham, Marcel\nDuchamp, Jasper Johns, and the\nSwiss artist Jean Tinguely.

Splitting the Other offers\nextensive documentation of\nMalani’s memorable work in multi-\nple media, in DVD as well as stills, as\nwell as texts by feminist art histori-\nan Whitney Chadwick (Women, Art\nand Society), German art historian\nDoris von Drathen (Vortex of Silence)\nand scholar Andreas Huyssen\n(Other Cities, Other Worlds).\n\nNalini Malani: Splitting the Other\nISBN 978-3-7757-2580-4\n\nHbk, 9.5 x 11.25 in. / 184 pgs /\n\n212 color / DVD (NTSC & PAL).\n\nU.S. $55.00 CDN $66.00\nAugust/Art/Asian Art & Culture\n\n \n\nExhibition Schedule\nLausanne, Switzerland: Musée\ncantonal des Beaux-Arts,\n03/20/10-10/06/10\n\nCHARTA/IRISH MUSEUM OF\nMODERN ART\n\n \n\nFrancis Alys: Le Temps\ndu Sommeil\n\nAfterword by Enrique Juncosa.\nThe Belgian-born artist Francis Als\n(born 1959) is known for his walks\nand tales executed in a wide range\nof media (documentary film, paint-\ning, photography, performance,\nvideo and installation) that marry\nhumor and sensitivity, banality and\nspontaneity, personal and political.\nA compulsive wanderer, many of his\nworks involve intense observation\nand recording of the social, cultural\nand economic conditions of urban\nlife. This beautifully designed\nvolume presents an ongoing series\nof paintings that function as kind of\na storyboard and archive of the\nartist’s oeuvre to date. Begun in\n1996, Le Temps du Sommeil (“The\nTime of Sleep”) comprises over\n\n100 paintings accompanied by\ninstructions and postcards related—\nsometimes obliquely—to the artist's\npast performative actions.

After the 1959\nCuban revolution, many architectural\nprojects and buildings were left\nunfinished or abandoned in the\nnation’s cities. Adopting Havana\n\nas his laboratory, Garaicoa creates\nprovocative visual commentaries\n\non such themes as architecture’s\nability to alter the course of history,\nthe failure of modernism as a\ncatalyst for social change and the\nfrustration and decay of twentieth-\ncentury utopias. Garaicoa makes his\ncritiques through large installations\nusing materials such as crystal,\nwax candles and rice-paper lamps:\nin “Bend City” (2007), the artist\nconstructed a city entirely from cut\npaper, and “The Crown Jewels”\n(2009) consists of miniature replicas\nof real-life torture centers, prisons\nand intelligence networks, all cast in\nsilver.

In 1997, having\nabandoned his work with interac-\ntive television, Villareal began to\npursue a more systems-based\napproach, devising complex light\nsculptures in which he combined\nstrobe lights, neon, and most\nrecently, LED bulbs activated by\nthe artist’s own extraordinary\ncustom-made software. The effect\nof these bulbs, and the software\nthat steers their flickering patterns,\nis cumulative and magical: thou-\nsands of tiny white LEDs may\nresemble a starry night as seenina\nplanetarium (Villareal installed this\nwork in the windows of the Peter\nJay Sharp Building at the Brooklyn\nAcademy of Music), while tubes of\ncolored LEDs masked by a diffuser\ngive a softer effect that resembles\nsomething like a Monet painting\nof water lilies set in motion.\n\nThis volume accompanies the\n\nfirst museum survey of Villareal’s\nhypnotic and exhilarating light\nsculptures at the San Jose Museum\nof Art.\n\nLeo Villareal\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-2656-6\n\nHbk, 10.75 x 11.5 in. / 192 pgs /\n140 color.\n\nU.S. $55.00 CDN $66.00\nDecember/Art\n\nExhibition Schedule\nSan Jose: San Jose Museum of Art,\n08/21/10-01/09/11\n\nHATJE CANTZ\n\n \n\nJames Turrell:\n\nZug Zuoz\n\nEdited by Matthias Haldemann.\nJames Turrell (born 1943) first came\nto prominence in the late 1960s as\na leading artist in the California\nLight and Space Movement.\nInformed by his studies in percep-\ntual psychology and optical illu-\nsions, Turrell’s works impact the\nbody, mind and spirit. Zug Zuoz is\ndevoted to two contrasting Turrell\ninstallations in Switzerland, both of\nwhich forge an encounter between\nthe architectural interior and the\nworld beyond it. “Light Transport,”\nlocated in the city of Zug, immerses\nthe internal facades and glass roof\nof the local train station in splendid\ncolors; “Skyspace Piz Uter” in Zuoz is\na plain, rounded stone structure\nwith a circular aperture in its roof\nthrough which to view the night\nsky.

The ports, holiday homes and artists’ houses, the boats, the washerwomen, the wind-\nmills, the open-air cafes, the picnics and the bathing supplied French painting with some of its most\niconic images, particularly during the Impressionist era, when painting stepped out of the studio\n\nand into the world. It was in this period, as the industrial revolution began to get underway and the\nlandscape began to alter accordingly, through the development of railways, ports and factories, that the\n\nrural world it threatened became an increasingly popular subject for painting. This volume brings\ntogether 60 paintings painted on the banks of the Seine, retracing the history of Impressionism and\nPost-Impressionism to Fauvism, from Eugéne Boudin to Henri Matisse. En route we encounter such\nfamiliar figures as Manet, Renoir, Monet, Pissarro, Sisley and Caillebotte, but also lesser-known figures\nsuch as Armand Guillaumin, Henri Rouart and Maximilien Luce.\n\nImpressionism on the Seine\n\nISBN 978-88-366-1620-6\n\nHbk, 9.75 x 11.75 in. / 144 pgs / 100 color.\nU.S. $39.50 CDN $47.00\n\nAugust/Art\n\nExhibition Schedule\n\nGiverny, Musée des Impressionismes, 04/01/10—-07/18/10\n\nTURNER\n\n \n\nThe University\n\nA History of Knowledge Transmission\nEdited by Fernando Tejerina.

The name stuck, and over the years it has come to designate the\npaintings and sculptures of artists as different from one another as Jackson Pollock and\nBarnett Newman, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner and David Smith.\nThe achievements of this generation put New York on the map as the center of the\ninternational art world, and constitute some of the twentieth century’s greatest\nmasterpieces. From the mid-1940s, under the aegis of Alfred H. Barr, Jr., works by then\nlittle-known American artists—including Pollock, de Kooning, Smith, Arshile Gorky and\nAdolph Gottlieb—began to enter the Museum's collection. These ambitious acquisition\ninitiatives continued throughout the second half of the last century and produced a\ncollection of Abstract Expressionist art the breadth and depth of which is unrivalled by\nany museum in the world. Supplemented by an essay by Ann Temkin, Chief Curator of\nPainting and Sculpture at MoMA, this volume celebrates the richness of the Museum's\nholdings of the paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs from this\nepochal moment in the history of art and of this institution.\n\nAbstract Expressionism at The Museum of Modern Art\nISBN 978-0-87070-793-3\n\nPbk, 9 x 10.5 in. / 128 pgs / 120 color.\n\nU.S. $34.95 CDN $42.00\n\nSeptember/Art\n\nExhibition Schedule\nNew York: The Museum of Modern Art, 09/21/10-04/25/1\n\nTHE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, NEW YORK\n\n \n\nBack in Print!\n\nModern Painting And Sculpture —_ Text by Carolyn Lanchner.\n\nConstantin Brancusi\n\n1880 to Present From The Museum of\nModern Art\n\nEdited by John Elderfield.\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art houses the most\n\nworld, and the Painting & Sculpture department\nforms the core of its holdings.

He founded the\nBykert Gallery in 1966, where he represented artists\nincluding Chuck Close, Ralph Humphrey, Brice\nMarden and Dorothea Rockburne; three decades\nlater, he curated the 1995 Whitney Biennial, the\nfollow-up to the famously political 1993 iteration.\n“What is being proposed here,” he wrote in a cata-\nlogue essay for the 1995 exhibition, “is not a return\nto formalism but an art in which meaning is\nembedded in formal value. An acknowledgment\n\nof sensuousness is indispensable—whether as play\nor sheer joy or the kind of subversity that has us\nreaching for a rose and grabbing a thorn.” The art\nworld has changed considerably from the relatively\nconvivial world of the 60s to today’s globalized\nmilieu, but Kertess has been a constant throughout\nthe years, curating shows of provocative new work\nand writing critical essays on artists whose work\nchallenges and engages him, while also maintain-\ning a vital literary sideline (his short stories are col-\nlected in 2000's South Brooklyn Casket Company).\nThis volume collects Kertess’ critical works from\nthe past 30 years, including meditations on Agnes\nMartin, Joan Mitchell, John Chamberlain, Vija\nCelmins, Chris Ofili and Matthew Richie.

The primary function of the\ncontemporary gallerist continues to be the one\nestablished by D.H.

Artists working in this highly traditional medium draw from a wealth\nof ancient themes, but must resolve them within contemporary Chinese culture. In\nFresh Ink, ten of China’s leading contemporary artists engage directly with the past by\ncreating ten new works in response to older masterpieces, ranging from classical\nChinese scrolls to a scholar's rock to a drip painting by Jackson Pollock. Their personal\nvisions reflect diverse concerns and influences, whether Xu Bing’s play on the absurdly\nmonumental, Qin Feng’s system of communicative signs, or the keen eye for society\nevident in the work of Li Jin, Yu Hong and Liu Xiaodong.

Dumas’ particular gift is to\nfreight the haunting handling of her imagery\nwith a political and/or sexual edge. Famed\ninternationally (especially since her Museum of\nModern Art retrospective of 2008) after three\ndecades of perfecting her vulnerable and poised\nstyle, Dumas continues to evolve these universal\nthemes of love and loss. Her newest series, titled\nAgainst the Wall, is comprised of large-scale\npaintings that include scenes of mourning\nmothers at the Western Wall in Jerusalem (also\nknown as the Wailing Wall).

Coffin, Gail S.\nDavidson, Ellen Lupton,\nPenelope Hunter-Stiebel.\n\nThe movement known as Rococo\n\nbegan in eighteenth-century France,\nand has infused design objects with\na sinuous, organic, and sensuous\nimpulse for three centuries. Rococo\ndominated French design from 1730\nto 1765, during the reign of Louis XV.\nRococo ideas, transmitted by prints,\nobjects and the traveling designers\nthemselves, quickly spread to\nEngland, the Netherlands, the\nGerman states, Italy and America.\nRococo resurfaced in England under\nthe flamboyant George IV and in\nFrance during the Second Empire. Its\nmost significant revival occurred in\nthe design concept known as Art\nNouveau. In the twenty-first century,\nthe Rococo spirit has burst forth\nonce again as a creative force.\nRococo: The Continuing Curve,\n1730-2008, featuring essays by\ninternational scholars and over 380\ncolor illustrations, traces the move-\nment within the historic continuum.\n\nRococo\n\nISBN 978-0-910503-91-4\n\nPbk, 9 x 11.5 in. / 272 pgs /\n\n380 color.\n\nU.S. $45.00 CDN $54.00\nAvailable/Design & Decorative Arts\n\nPiranesi as Designer\nEdited by Sarah E. Lawrence.\nText by John Wilton-Ely, Peter\nEisenman, Alvar Gonzalez-\nPalacios, Michael Graves, Alice\nJarrard, Peter N. Miller, Ronald\nDe Leeuw, David Rosand, Bent\nSorensen.\n\nJustly renowned as one of the\nfinest printmakers of the eigh-\nteenth century, Giovanni Battista\nPiranesi (1720-1778) is best known\nfor his etched views of Rome and\nits antiquities, as well as for his\nhighly influential suite of drawings\nentitled Carceri, or Imaginary\nPrisons. Trained as an architect,\nPiranesi revolutionized architecture\nand design through his combina-\ntion of decorative elements and\nornamental motifs from the\nEgyptian, Etruscan, Greek and\nRoman styles; yet his work as the\ndesigner of interiors and furnish-\nings has been largely uncelebrated\nuntil now. Published in conjunction\nwith a major exhibition at the\nSmithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt,\nNational Design Museum, in 2007,\nPiranesi as Designer features ten\naccessible essays and more than\n300 rare illustrations that explore\nthe far-reaching impact of\nPiranesi’s style on three centuries\nof architecture and design.\n\nPiranesi as Designer\n\nISBN 978-0-910503-95-2\n\nPbk, 9 x 1 in. / 360 pgs / 325 color.\nU.S. $45.00 CDN $54.00\nAvailable/Design & Decorative Arts\n\nHouse Proud\nNineteenth-Century\nWatercolor Interiors from\nthe Thaw Collection\n\nText by Gail S. Davidson, Floramae\nMcCarron-Cates, Charlotte Gere.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, it\nbecame fashionable for aristocratic\nand upper-class homeowners in\nEurope to commission watercolor\npaintings of their domestic interi-\nors and to collect them in albums.\nHouse Proud: Nineteenth-century\nWatercolor Interiors from the Thaw\nCollection commemorates the\nrecent gift of 85 nineteenth-centu-\nry watercolor interior drawings—\nthe largest collection of its kind in\nAmerica—to Cooper-Hewitt\nNational Design Museum by\nEugene V. and Clare E.

In recent years, the\nfabric has found contemporary appli-\ncations in an extraordinary range of\nfields, including product design, fash-\nion, architecture and home furnish-\nings. Felt’s first revival in modern\ntimes occurred as a part of the fiber-\narts movement of the 1970s; the\n1990s saw a surge of innovations in\nits production, triggering the current\nresurgence of interest in the fabric. A\ncombination of scholarly research\ninto its history, the exploration of its\ntechnical applications and sustain-\nability issues have inspired many\nleading artists and designers to work\nwith felt. Fashioning Felt examines\nthis recent explosion of interest.\nPublished in conjunction with a\nmajor exhibition at the\nSmithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt,\nNational Design Museum, it presents\nhandmade and commercially pro-\nduced designs for felt, and explores\nthrough essays and full-color illustra-\ntions the material's rich history.\n\nFashioning Felt\n\nISBN 978-0-910503-89-1\n\nPbk, 8 x 11 in. / 144 pgs / 200 color.\nU.S. $35.00 CDN $42.00\nAvailable/Design & Decorative Arts\n\nExhibition Schedule\n\nSan Francisco, CA: San Francisco\nMuseum of Craft+Design,\n10/10-02/11\n\nwww.artbook.com | 167\n\nw\nBd\na\nAza\n=\niva)\n=|\nx=\n(a)\n=\n=\n(a)\n=\n=|\niva)",
