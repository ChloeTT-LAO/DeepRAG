But\nthe hour had come for a small Swedish ribbon weaving company.\n\nToday it is hard to imagine that a few decades ago, most cars were shipped\nwithout seat belts. In other respects, too, little attention was paid to accident\nprevention at that time, and so many collisions, from which today one would\nemerge unscathed, had fatal consequences.\n\nIn order to counter this, the Swedish car company Volvo approached the ribbon\nweaving companies AB Textilkonst and Klippan at the end of the 1950s, with\ninstructions to develop a safety belt for its vehicles.\n\nVolvo was already building very sturdy cars that withstood the harsh Swedish\nwinters and other tests, but it wanted to continue to improve the safety of the\noccupants.\n\nogether with Volvo engineers, Klippan developed the first car safety belt in the\nworld, made of high-strength fabric ribbon.\n\nIt was installed in models Amazon and 544 for the first time in 1959 and caused\na lot of astonishment in the public, but also ensured an enduring image of\nSwedish inventions as both pioneering and durable.\n\nHow we replaced ropes and chains\n\nhe car safety belt was a great success, and soon other manufacturers had also\ninstalled it. Thanks to the great demand, Erik Ehnimb, co-owner of Klippan, was\nable to found the SpanSet company in Malm6 in 1966.\n\nhe ribbons produced by SpanSet were quickly and enthusiastically employed in\nmany other areas, where up to that point chains and wire ropes had been used,\nas in the case of the transport of paper. The customers appreciated the enormous\noad-bearing capacity of the new lashing and lifting belts.\n\nin 1967, Mr. Ehnimb founded SpanSet AG in Hombrechtikon in the Zurich\nhighlands, and additional companies in Germany, Italy, France and England.\nLater, companies in Asia, America and Australia were added, thus forming a\nglobal distribution network.\n\n \n\nSpanSet UK are based in a modern, purpose-built factory in Middlewich,\nCheshire and has been in operation for over 40 years. The company's vast\nexperience in webbing based products provided the perfect background to\ndevelop over 20 years ago the innovative range of height safety equipment. The\nrange covers all applications from Fall Arrest and Work Positioning to Rope\nAccess and the Gotcha Rescue Range.\n\n \n\n \n\nSpanSet continue to live up to their international heritage of innovations in\ndesign with new developments in products and services. The new developments\nenable us to push beyond the basic European Standards for design in Height\nSafety equipment.",
    "Page_6": "How our inventions became the norm...\n\ne SpanSet products with their load capacity have gained such a good\neputation around the world that interntional safety standards have been\norientated to it.\n\ne development of standards for Height Safety equipment has been significantly\nnfluenced by SpanSet; for instance, in national working groups that determine\nwhat constitutes a standard and in which SpanSet is regularly included.\n\nn\n\npanSet were part of the team who drafted the standard BS8454:2006 for the\nelivery of Training and Education for Working at Height and Rescue and the first\ncompany to be audited to this standard by the BSI.\n\n2\n\nis is how something becomes the norm: by setting a standard. And doing so\nrepeatedly for more than 40 years.\n\n.. and our norm influenced new inventions\n\nis also means that we are often called on during the development of a new\nroduct (after all, it will eventually be transported by our belts) and also\nncreasingly offer support as a partner for safety training and consultation.\n\n \n\nis is how SpanSet went from small ribbon weaving company to international\norerunner when it comes to Height Safety, transportation and safety — through\nexceptional performance and recognition.\n\nHow we let one world first follow the next\nn 1997, SpanSet launched the “Power” sling series as well as the new\ngeneration of roundslings with textile wire reinforcement in the protective\njacket for maximum tear resistance — even back then capable of bearing up to 50\ntonnes.\n\nn 1992, the Horizontal Safety Line — the first temporary horizontal anchorage\nine to employ a webbing and ratchet system for pretension, and to give a\nredictable deflection during a fall.\n\n \n\nhe ABS pressure ratchet, another world first, appeared in 1995. This allows a\ngradual release of the tensioned ratchet, so that goods at risk of falling could be\nunloaded safely.\n\n2001, The Gotcha range of rescue equipment. The first pre-assembled rescue\nkits offering remote attachment and recovery of a suspended worker. Followed\nby the WRAPPA, the first anchorage sling tested for attachment to a vertical\ntube on a scaffold structure.\n\nIn 2002, SpanSet launched the Tension Force Indicator (TFI) which is integrated\nin the tensioning ratchet and indicates the pre-tensioning force. Thus, the use\nof lashing equipment became safer and more economical.\n\n \n\nThe TFI is now incorporated into the Horizontal Safety Line above.\n\nAlso in 2002 SpanSet established the Modular Height Safety Training Courses.\nMoving training away from individually bespoke courses towards industry\nrecognised standard qualifications. CAPCHA the overhead fall arrest system for\ncurtain side vehicles and workshops was launched in 2004.\n\nWorking closely with clients in the offshore Oil and Gas industry SpanSet\ndeveloped their first “collective measure” for work at height — a temporary\ndecking system in 2004. This design has been developed and improved to\nbecome the first product in the Walkabout range of collective measures.\n\n2005 the Proof Loader Kit was launched — the complete anchorage and testing\nsystem for workers to quickly establish and quantify their own anchor points in\nconcrete or geological features.\n\n2008, another first for SpanSet. The ATLAS 140 range — the first complete\nrange of products developed specifically to meet the requirements of larger\nworkers.\n\nSpanSet — a way to success that always results\nfrom being one step ahead!\n\nWe are quite proud of our achievements. After all, they have contributed to\nsafer and easier working conditions around the world — and thus to fewer\naccidents and lower operating costs.\n\nWe were especially glad to hear the story of a policeman, who during a truck\ncheck replaced his official severity with a friendly smile after seeing that the\ncargo was secured with our products.\n\nMeeting standards is good. Setting standards is better.\n\nThe SpanSet brand stands for something. Not only for meeting international\nsafety standards, but for raising them again and again. For example, the new\nEU lashing standard would not exist without our lashing belts.\n\nThis is exactly what we stand for with our products, services and consultancy:\nfor more security than is demanded today — namely, as much as is possible\ntomorrow.\n\nThat is our goal, that is our job and that is our passion.\n\nSo that those who work with SpanSet can also trust in it in the future — just\nlike the police.\n\nSpanSet — Certified Safety",

    "Page_15": "The 3 Categories for the Use of\nPersonal Fall Protection Equipment\n\nWork Restraint\n\nThis category of work covers techniques that restrict the movement of the user\nto prevent them approaching fall hazards. Careful assessment must be carried\nout first to identify all the relevant fall hazards. An effective technique will then\nprovide an extremely high level of safety.\n\nWork Position\n\nTechniques in this category utilise equipment to suspend the user in their\n‘work position’. As the user is then suspended at height, careful selection\nof the equipment and adequate training are essential in order to provide an\neffective solution. Work positioning techniques generally require an additional\nsafety or back-up system. This must also be selected using the hierarchy, but\nit is quite common for fall arrest techniques to be chosen.\n\nFall Arrest\n\nFall arrest is the only category that actually allows a fall to take place.\nThe fall arrest system then reacts by arresting the fall in a controlled manner.\nCareful consideration must be given to ensure that the system selected is\nsuitable for use in the intended orientation and that there is adequate\nclearance height below the user to prevent contact with obstacles\nduring a fall.\n\nFor further information visit our website.\n\nHIERARCHY OF\nSAFETY MEASURES\n\nGuidance for Safe\nWork at Height\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nWhere your risk assessment shows a worker can\nall, you must carefully plan how you will protect\nthem. There are 3 basic levels of protection;\nAvoidance, prevention, or mitigation.\n\nf work at height can be avoided then the risk of\nalling is eliminated.\n\nf it is not possible to avoid working at height\nways of preventing a fall should be addressed\nwith preference placed on collective measure\nwhich protect all workers. Personal fall protection\nharnesses should only be used as a last resort.\n\nin some situations it is not possible to prevent the\nall, for example when climbing between various\nworking levels/platforms. In this situation the\nworker requires some form of protection from the\neffects of the fall. This could be done by reducing\nthe fall distance, or by limiting the impact force\nelt as the fall is arrested. Again collective\nsystems are given preference to a personal fall\nprotection harness.\n\nt may not always be possible to provide fall\nprotection to eliminate the risk of injury, therefore\nin these situations then you must take steps to\nreduce the risk of falling as much as possible,\nor example through competence training when\nworkers are left with a step ladder as the only\nmethod of work.\n\nf your risk assessment shows that it is acceptable\nto use personal fall protection your workers will\nhave three ways in which their equipment can\nbe used. It is therefore essential to properly\nidentify environment constraints and the type of\nprotection the workers require. The 3 techniques\nwith which a harness can be used to protect\nworkers are; Work Restraint, Work Position and\nFall Arrest. The workers must properly understand\nthe level of risk and function of their equipment in\neach technique.\n\n \n\n15",

Training\n\n \n\nIndustry sectors that use\n\nWork Restraint techniques:\n\nRoof Work\n\nPowered Access\n\n \n\nVehicle Fall Protection\n\n \n\nFacilities Management\n\nSeG@O\n\nWork Restraint prevents falls before they happen\n\nWhen a worker is required to approach an\nunprotected fall hazard, the safest method of\naccess is a Work Restraint System. A Work\nRestraint System uses equipment to restrict\nmovement, creating a safe working zone and\neventing the worker from reaching the fall hazard.\nCare should be taken when setting up the system to\nensure that the safe working zone is effective, as\nonce in place the worker's level of awareness will\ndecrease. An effective Work Restraint System\nrovides an extremely high level of safety.\n\nWork Restraint Systems can be broken down into 4\ney components. An Anchor Point, a Connecting\nElement, a Harness and the Knowledge to use them\nall safely.\n\nIt is essential to ensure that all the components\nof your system are compatible. The equipment you\nselect may also be suitable for use in a Fall Arrest\nor Work Positioning System. If you have any doubts\nas to the suitability of height safety equipment\nlease contact SpanSet for advice.\n\n \n\nWhy choose SpanSet for Work Restraint\nequipment?\n\nAs part of SpanSet’s commitment to Height Safety\nTraining, developing the safest work methods and\nequipment is vital. SpanSet have been heavily\ninvolved in promoting work restraint techniques\nsince we began delivering training 15 years ago.\n\nPractical solutions for everyday work\n\nSpanSet have developed a range of solutions for\nwork on rooftops and near exposed edges. Our\nknowledge in this area has undergone a continual\ndevelopment in conjunction with a number of major\nclients and importantly from the experience\nreceived through our training department.\n\nOur products range from temporary solutions\nthrough to permanently installed systems. We can\nsupply both ready made solutions for typical work\nat height environments in the form of kits and\nbespoke systems made up form a combination of\nour compatible components/elements.\n\nWork Restraint prevents falls before they happen\n\nty\nPROBLEM",
    "Page_25": "1. Anchor\n\nThe anchor point is the key to a safe personal fall\nprotection system. The type of work that you do\nand the location you are working in will determine\nwhat anchor points are available for you to use\nand what anchorage devices are suitable.\nAnchors for work restraint need to be able to\nwithstand at least 3 times the users mass\n(BS8437), however work restraint systems will\nnormally use anchorage devices approved to\nEN795. When selecting a suitable anchorage it\nmust be located in a position that will allow the\nsystem to prevent a fall.\n\n2. Connector\n\nThe connecting element of a work restraint system\nmust be of a suitable length to limit the workers\nmovement to within the safe working zone. A fixed\nlength lanyard can provide an effective solution,\nbut the lack of adjustment will limit the situations\nit can be used in. Providing a worker with an\nadjustable lanyard or adjustable line will enable\nthem to create effective restraint systems to suit\ntheir environment.\n\n3. Harness\n\nWork restraint systems can incorporate virtually\nany style of harness. The user of a work restraint\nsystem may find the use of a rear attachment\nbeneficial as they can then approach the hazard or\nwork area with the safety system outside their\nworking zone. The use of Belts for restraint is not\nincorrect, however SpanSet recommend that for\nmost situations a full body harness is preferable\nproviding improved support and security.\n\nTraining\n\nTraining is an essential part of your Work Restraint\nsolution. To be confident that your employees will\nnot be at risk of falling, they must understand the\nbasic principles involved with planning, using and\nmaintaining the equipment.\n\nWorkers who have little or no experience of work\nrestraint systems or equipment are unlikely to\noperate them effectively. Workers must understand\nthat the type of equipment on its own will not\ncreate a work restraint system, it is the way it is\nused to prevent falls occurring that is important.\n\nBy selecting the appropriate modules from our\nmodular format you will be able to create a\ncompetent worker who is able to assess the task,\nselect the right equipment, carry out pre-use\nchecks and use the equipment safely.",

The\nsecondary connection should be selected using the\nierarchy to provide a combined solution offering\nthe highest level of safety.\n\nit is common for an industrial climber to use a fall\narrest system for protection during a climb, but\nonce at their work site they add in a work position\nsystem to enable them to carry out the task using\noth hands.\n\nWork position systems when incorporated with a\nsecondary system require staff with the correct\naptitude and training in order to operate them\neffectively.\n\n \n\nA basic Work Position system is comprised of 5\nparts. An Anchor Point, a Connecting Device that\nSupports the worker, a Connecting Device for\n\nAccess and Backup, a Harness and the Knowledge\nto use them all safely.\n\nWhy choose SpanSet for Work Positioning\nequipment?\n\nFor over ten years SpanSet have been developing\nand presenting training and equipment solutions\nincluding rescue for the telecoms industry.

    "Page_35": "1. Anchor\n\nThe anchor points chosen together with their\nposition and their strength can have a substantial\neffect on the effectiveness of a work position\nsystem. The anchor should be unquestionably sound,\npossibly being a structural element or one tested /\ncertified to EN795. The chosen location of the anchor\npoint or the use of a mobile anchor is important to\nallow the worker to position adjacent to the work\ntask. Both the primary and secondary systems will\nrequire an anchorage and the strength of the anchor\npoint must therefore be sufficient for the primary\nsystem (positional) as well as the secondary\n(potentially fall arrest).\n\n2. Connector (Support)\n\nThe primary connector for a work position system\nmust be able to support the worker and hold them in\nthe correct position to be able to work hands free.\nThis means that the connector should be able to\nadjust easily to allow the worker to set the position\neffectively. The most common way to do this is with\na work position lanyard. However many devices are\navailable for work positioning that include different\nfeatures suitable for specific applications.\n\n3. Connector (Access and Back-up)\n\nThe Secondary Connector must be able to support\nthe worker in the event of the primary system failing\nor when climbing the secondary connector must be\ncapable of supporting the worker should they fall. As\na result of this it is common for the secondary\nconnector to be a fall arrest system. Suitable fall\narrest systems include flexible line fall arresters,\nguided type fall arresters and fall arrest lanyards.\nThe main considerations in selection being how it\nworks in conjunction with the primary system.\n\n4, Harness\n\nThe harness must be able to support the workers\nbody in a comfortable position while they are\nworking. The type of support offered by the harness\ndepends whether it is being used to hold the worker\nin tension as they balance on a structure, or to\nsuspend the worker freely from the structure. If the\nharness is used for climbing and working on a\nstructure then it should be a full body harness with a\nsuitable work-positioning belt. If the worker is\nsuspended freely then the harness should support\nthem in a seated position.\n\nTraining\nTraining is an important part of a work positioning\nsystem because the techniques used are varied and\ncan be complex. The ability to thoroughly risk assess\nand plan the whole process is vital. There are many\nstages to the work, from safe access, secure\npositioning, equipment maintenance and _ finally\nemergency planning. If these are not properly\naddressed then workers will be left at risk. SpanSet\ntraining courses are designed to address all when\nimplementing a work positioning technique as part\nof your safe method of work.\n\nThe key to an efficient work positioning system is\nbeing able to adapt the available techniques and\nequipment to suit the environment you will be\nworking in. The SpanSet training modules help you\nto select the most appropriate courses and combined\nwith the wealth of experience held by our training\nteam ensure you get the best support when planning\nwork positioning projects.",

Training\n\n \n\nIndustry sectors that use\nFall Arrest techniques:\n\nScaffolding\n\nWind Energy\n\nTower crane erection\nand maintenance\n\nHigh Bay Pallet Racking\n\nWOOO\n\nFall Arrest limiting the distance and effects of a fall\n\nWhere a worker requires freedom of movement to\nclimb between platforms, or move around on a\nstructure, then it may not be possible to remove\nthe risk of a fall completely. In these situations it is\nimportant to mitigate the consequences of the fall\nas far as possible. This is a common situation in\nareas where workers build, maintain or dismantle\nstructures such as Scaffolding, steel frame\nbuildings, tower cranes or racking systems.\n\nFall arrest systems work by keeping the fall\ndistance and impact forces to within known limits.\nDifferent items of equipment achieve this in\ndifferent ways and understanding this enables\nusers to select the most appropriate method for\ntheir application. The fact that this type of\nprotection allows the worker to fall also means\nthat consideration must be given to rescue or\nrecovery of a suspended worker.\n\nThe training required for the use of fall arrest\nequipment should include both theoretical and\npractical sessions so that users can match their\nunderstanding to real life applications. The theory\nside must look at all aspects from planning through\nto implementation and rescue.\n\nAll fall arrest equipment will limit the impact\nforces applied to the user to below 6kN. Some\n\nequipment achieves this by limiting the potential\nfall thus preventing the user gathering momentum.\nAlternatively equipment can allow the fall to occur\nand slow the falling user down over a known\ndistance by dissipating the energy generated.\n\nWhen considering clearance heights users should\ntake into account obstacles such as_ plant,\nmachinery, structural elements as well as platforms\nor floor levels. Items that limit the fall distance\ngenerally require anchorages above the user to be\neffective, but are better suited where clearance\nheight is a problem. Where the only anchorages\nare at or below the users foot level then equipment\nthat can dissipate energy are generally more\nappropriate, but they will require increased\nclearance height.\n\nRescue planning may seem daunting, but SpanSet\npioneered the provision of rescue solutions\ndesigned for one worker to rescue another. Rescue\nsolutions range from improvised methods utilising\navailable access equipment, to the complex and\nbespoke techniques of the emergency services and\nthrough to simple pre assembled kits. The key is\nselecting the right one for the user and their\napplication.",
    "Page_53": "1. Anchor\n\nThe anchor point for a Fall Arrest System must be\nable to withstand the shock load generated as the\nfall is arrested. Therefor e in every situation\nSpanSet recommends that the worker selects an\nanchor point that is unquestionably sound, or an\nanchor device which is tested to EN795.\n\n2. Connector\n\nThe connector in a fall arrest system performs the\ncritical function of arresting the workers fall. The\naim is to have as little “slack” as possible, so that\nthe connector will begin to arrest the fall as soon as\npossible. However some connectors also include\nenergy absorbing elements that are able to reduce\nthe impact force of the fall when there is significant\n“slack” in the system. The choice of connector may\nbe influenced by the clearance height available\nbelow the user\n\n3. Harness\n\nThe harness must be able to support the workers\nbody in the correct position as the fall is arrested.\nThe European standard ensures the harness will\nalways be strong enough to do its job, however it is\nessential that the worker has the correct size of\nharness for it to function properly. It must also be\npractical and comfortable in use while the worker is\nmoving and carrying out their normal tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTraining is the essential final element in a Fall\nArrest System, because of the inherent risks of\nincorrect use. The worker must be certain that each\nof the components already described has been\nchosen correctly and that they are fully competent\nin there use. If the worker is not able to understand\nthe correct use, or the potential consequences of\nmisuse, then the employer has a legal responsibility\nto address this through training. There are no\nsecond chances when a worker falls.

Traditionally a great deal of\nemphasis has been placed on this area by those\nworking in extreme environments and quite rightly\nso. It also applies however to areas that appear\nmore straightforward, but in these areas it is seldom\naddressed.\n\nUnconsciousness or death can occur to a suspended\ncasualty even though they may not be injured after\ntheir initial fall. This is due to a decrease in the\neffective circulation of oxygenated blood around the\nbody caused by a combination of factors, such as\nbody position, compression by the harness and a\nlack of muscle pumping of venous blood.\n\nIf the worker is able to move, or relieve the pressure\npoints, then the side effects can be dramatically\nreduced. However in the case of an unconscious\nworker the side effects continue unchecked and\nrescue is the only option. The time it takes for this\ncondition to affect a person can vary greatly, so\nhaving an effective solution at hand for a speedy\nresolution is essential.\n\nThere are several approaches to rescue provision,\n1st Response Rescue, Emergency Response Teams\nand the Emergency Services, each approach having\nit's own merits and disadvantages. The rescue\nequipment can also take many different forms all\nwith different levels of risk, training requirements,\naptitude and commitment.\n\nIt is therefore important to identify the solution that\nis right for your application. In order to do this you\nmust consider all the variables such as the\nequipment they are using, where they are using it\nand the capability of the users. The GOTCHA™\nRescue Range has been designed to provide simple,\npre-assembled solutions for a variety of applications.\n\n \n\nAnother aspect of emergency planning that can\nbe confused with Rescue is Evacuation.\n\nA useful definition between Rescue and Evacuation is:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYes\nIs the person Is the person\nin imminent No able to escape the No\ndanger situation unaided\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYes",
