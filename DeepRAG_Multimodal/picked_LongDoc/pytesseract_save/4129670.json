    "Page_7": "I. Introduction\n\nDuring the 2021 primary election on June 22, New Y orkers will have a say in how the City moves\nforward from the pandemic. Every citywide office is on the ballot, including Mayor. As usual, the\nmayoral field is crowded. The leading Democratic contenders currently registering in the polls are\nEric Adams (Brooklyn Borough President), Shaun Donovan (former Secretary of Housing and\nUrban Development and director of the Office of Management and Budget under President\nObama), Kathryn Garcia (former Sanitation Commissioner under Mayor de Blasio), Ray\nMcGuire (former V ice-chair of Citigroup), Dianne Morales (former Executive Director and CEO\nof social-services nonprofit Phipps Neighborhoods), Scott Stringer (New Y ork City Comptroller),\nMaya Wiley (civil rights lawyer and activist; former counsel to Mayor de Blasio), and Andrew\nYang (entrepreneur; former presidential candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary). In addition,\nthere are two Republican candidates: Fernando Mateo (President of the New York State\nFederation of Taxi Drivers and spokesperson for the United Bodegas of America) and Curtis\nSliwa (founder and CEO of the Guardian Angels and radio-talk-show host). Profiles for all the\ncandidates are included in A ppendix B.\n\nRegardless of who wins, current NY C Mayor Bill de Blasio’s successor will need to deal with the\npandemic’s aftermath, as well the unprecedented economic disruption it has wrought on New\nY orkers and the City. Among the many policy decisions the new mayor must make will be those\naffecting transportation—or, as it has been variously referred to by the candidates, the “central\nnervous system,” “heartbeat,” and “lifeblood” of the City. From busways, bike lanes, and “Open\nStreets” to traffic congestion, Vision Zero, aggressive emissions and climate-change goals, the\nnext mayor will shape the way people and goods move around the City for years to come. Budgets\nwill be tighter and tough decisions will need to be made about which transportation policies the\nCity will pursue.\n\nFor the mayoral election in 2013, the University Transportation Research Center (“UTRC”) at\nThe City College of New Y ork (CCNY), of the City University of New Y ork (CUNY), issued a\nreport entitled the “Mayoral Election Transportation Policy & Issue Primer: Candidates’\nPositions and Plans.”' The Center has again compiled this report for the 2021 New Y ork City\nmayoral primary election summarizing the leading candidates’ positions on key issues impacting\ntransportation. The purpose of this report is to educate voters on important transportation issues\nand the candidates’ stances on the issues that matter to New Y orkers.\n\nLike 2013, for the 2021 report, the UTRC again convened a NYC Mayoral Election\nTransportation Policy Advisory Committee, which was formed to advise and assist in the\npreparation of this report, and which was chaired and led by the author of this report, UTRC\nTransportation Technology Chair Matthew W. Daus, Esq. The Advisory Committee is\ncomprised of experts from every mode in the transportation field, including government\n\n1 https://bit.ly/3vqBw6F\n\n{11935670:1}",

The survey was limited to the top ten questions as selected by the Advisory\nCommittee from a repository of more than 50 questions. Each candidate identified in this report\nwas given an opportunity to respond. Each candidate’s positions are summarized in tables within\nthis report and included along with the candidate’s profile in Appendix B.\n\nThe author and the Advisory Committee identified the transportation topics addressed in this\nreport. The report covers an array of transportation topics that the next mayor will or could face\nwhen governing New Y ork City, from hot topics like busways and bike lanes to more niche issues\nlike commuter vans and taxi stands. While it is important for voters to understand these issues, it\nis not reasonable to expect candidates to form positions on every issue, and candidates have not\ntaken a position on important issues recognized by experts.\n\nThe report is not exhaustive and does not attempt to amass each and every utterance, thought, and\nstatement of the candidates throughout their careers. However, this report is a useful tool to help\nvoters understand where candidates stand on many issues and how the candidates may handle\nsimilar issues if elected. To further assist voters, the report includes a Transportation Policy\nVoter E-Palm Card in Appendix A of that sets forth highlights of the candidates’ positions,\nproposed policies, and plans they have in the transportation realm.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, it is our hope that this report will form the basis for the\nwinning primary candidates — and the next mayor of NYC -— to benefit from the ideas of their\ncolleagues in the race. While only two of the primary candidates will win here, NY C and everyone\nwins if the candidates’ ideas, as detailed in this report, can become new and innovative\ntransportation policies ideas that are debated by the Democratic and Republican candidates from\nnow until the General Election in November 2021. We would ask the next mayor of NYC to\nconsider the ideas of his or her former opponents, as well as the suggested transportation policy\npriorities outlined by the UTRC and its Advisory Committee, as the next administration and our\nCity embark on a path to recovery and resiliency.\n\n{11935670:1}",

The Program is targeted to\nsmall medallion owners who are struggling with medallion-related debt. ® These are the key\ndetails of the program:\n\ne Medallion owners with five medallions or fewer and outstanding medallion loan debt\nare eligible for the program. Medallion owners are not required to be drivers to\nparticipate.\n\ne Long-term, 0% interest loans of up to $20,000 to use as a down payment to assist in\nrestructuring medallion debt.\n\ne Up to $9,000 in no-interest loans to make as many as six monthly loan payments of\n$1,500.\n\nb) The City Council Medallion Task Force: On May 19, 2019, the City Council passed\nlegislation to create a Medallion Task Force to address medallion values, which Mayor de\nBlasio supported and signed into law.’ The Task Force was led by Councilmembers Y danis\nRodriguez and Stephen Levin and included lender, owner, and driver representatives. In\nJanuary 2020, the Task Force issued its report including its recommendations concerming the\nfinancial crisis faced by many medallion owners. They made the recommendations that the\nCity:\n\ne Take ownership of the situation as the City was an advocate for, and beneficiary of,\nincreasing values.\n\ne Create a debt purchase and modification program where in the City could directly\nacquire the loans.\n\ne Facilitate the creation of a pool of money from socially conscious, mission-driven\ninvestors, such as a retirement fund or bank as a lead lender.\n\nc) The New York Taxi Workers Alliance Plan for “Debt Forgiveness:” In July 2020, the New\nY ork Taxi Workers Alliance (““NYTWA”), the largest organization that represents taxi drivers,\n\n* https://council.nyc.gov/data/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2020/01/Taxi-Medallion-Task-Force-Report-Final.pdf\n5 https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/168-21/mayor-de-blasio-taxi-medallion-owner-driver-relief-\nfund#:~:text=The%20%2465%20million%20Taxi%20Medallion, monthly%20loan%20payments%200f%20%241%2C\n500.\n© https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/taxi-medallion-owner-relief-program.page\n7 Local Law 212 of 2018\n\n4\n{119356701}",
    "Page_11": "announced its Medallion Debt Forgiveness Campaign, which included provisions for\nstructuring medallion loans with certain guarantees from New Y ork City. The key provisions\nof the plan:\n\nLoan Terms: In the announced proposal from July 2020, medallion lenders are being\nasked to reduce the medallion loan debt to no more than $125,000 and forgive all debt\nin excess of $125,000 with a refinance that would not exceed $900 per month (emphasis\nadded). In the update from NY TWA, the debt forgiveness plan was further detailed to\nask lenders to set the term of the loans to not exceed 20 years, with a fixed 4% interest\nrate and a monthly payment of $757 per month. The plan language makes it clear that\nlenders are not mandated to restructure loans.\n\nLoan Guarantee: In retum for forgiving the debt, the plan calls on the City to\n“backstop” the loans in the debt forgiveness plan to incentivize the lenders to\nrestructure the medallion loans. Based on the plan, the City’s guarantees of the loans\nshould not exceed $75 million. This would be the equivalent of 600 loans with a\n$125,000 balance. There is no further information from the NY TWA or other reports\nin support of calculating the City’s exposure.\n\nMedallion Loan Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. Rep. Gregory Meeks introduced H.R.\n2077 on March 19, 2021 (this bill was H.R. 5167 in the last Congress). This legislation\nwould provide some financial relief for taxi medallion owners by not considering debt\nforgiveness they receive as income. This bill excludes from gross income, for income\ntax purposes, the income of a taxpayer, other than a C corporation, attributable to the\ndischarge of qualified taxi medallion indebtedness. When this legislation was first\nannounced in January 2020, then-Congressman Peter King and Signature Bank\nannounced their support for this bill. The legislation is now co-sponsored by the entire\nNYC congressional delegation and has bipartisan support. Given the change of\nleadership in the U.S. Senate in 2021, this legislation may move forward in the months\nahead in the 117th Congress, and there is no reason to believe President Biden would\nnot sign the legislation.\n\nForeclosed Medallions: The NYTWA has asked lenders to include foreclosed\nmedallions in this plan. In other words, the medallion owner would be able to refinance\nfor the same terms with a $125,000 medallion loan cap and “take back” the medallions.\n\nd) The Medallion Asset Relief Program (“MARP”): This is a proposal initially made by then-\nNYC Councilmember Ritchie Torres in March 2020. Torres modeled his proposal after\nPresident Obama’s Home Affordable Refinance Program (“HARP”), which was released in\nMarch 2009, to allow homeowners with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80% to refinance\nwithout also paying for mortgage insurance. The New Y ork City Council did not advance the\nlegislation. These are the key provisions:\n\ne Medallion value reset: Initially, the plan would revalue all New Y ork City taxi medallions\nat $250,000. In September 2020, Torres clarified MARP would only cover the medallions\nowned by the 6,250 medallion owner-drivers, and the fleets that own 20 or fewer\nmedallions. The goal of MARP is to substantially lower the monthly payments that have\n\n{11935670:1}\n\n5",
    "Page_12": "created financial distress to this group of medallion owners. The proposal does not address\nwhat, if anything, should be done for fleet owners with more than 20 medallions.\nReduced Payments: MARP would reduce the medallion owners’ monthly payments to\napproximately $1,100 per month. Since the City would guarantee the loans (see below),\nTorres expects lenders would reduce their interest rates as well.\n\nMandates: The program contemplates a mandate for the medallion valuation. As a result,\nTorres had acknowledged that the City alone does not have the legal or regulatory authority\nto impose the mandate.\n\nThe City Guarantee.

Governor Cuomo also said they would also be allowed to expand eligibility to Uber, Lyft\nand taxi drivers. “If a local health department — county government — wants to add to what's called\nthe '1B prioritization’ — if they want to add taxi drivers, Uber drivers, — they can do that if they\nthink it works within their prioritization locally,\" the governor said. The same day, New Y ork\nCity Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that Phase 1b of vaccines would be available to all TLC\nlicensees.°\n\nThe Governor’s announcement was a direct result of consistent efforts by industry leaders, elected\nofficials, transportation regulators, and candidates for office voicing their support for rightfully\nprioritizing these drivers. At the State level, New Y ork State Senator Jessica Ramos — joined by\n19 other state legislators — wrote a letter to Governor Cuomo and Dr. Howard Zucker,\nCommissioner of the New Y ork State Department of Health, asking that these drivers and delivery\nworkers be included in Phase 1b of vaccine prioritization.

MTA Reform, City Takeover & Privatization\n\nPublic transit systems like New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”) often\nsuffer from mispricing, misallocated funds, suboptimal service and investments, and skyrocketing\nproduction costs. Often times, this is a result of government control. As a result, many aspiring\nmayors have used the idea of the City taking control of the subway from the state-run MTA to\nlaunch their campaigns. Many of the current mayoral candidates have expressed concern and\nskepticism about the City taking over the subway during a fiscal crisis brought on by COVID-19;\nbut, Andrew Y ang is in favor of the proposal.\n\nCurrently, collected fares cover only about half of the subway’s annual operating expenses while\nnot even making a dent in capital costs. The MTA relies on Albany to levy taxes on New Y orkers\nto pay for the MTA. These include everything from gas taxes to mansion taxes. As a result, state\nlegislators from around New Y ork, many of whom rarely use the subway, retain a great deal of\ncontrol over the system and have an interest in maintaining that control.\n\nCandidate Positions on MTA Reform, City Takeover & Privatization\nCandidate Position\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEric Adams Adams does not believe a City takeover of the MTA is practical.\n\nShaun Donovan Donovan does not see a pathway to be able to take over the subways,\nbut believes the City should have a mayor that has more power over the\nsubways.\n\n \n\nKathryn Garcia Garcia would love to see the City take control, but only if the City has\nthe revenue to support it.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRay McGuire McGuire does not believe the City can afford an MTA takeover.\n\nDianne Morales Does not support City-control of the MTA.\n\nScott Stringer Stringer believes it is “not practical” for the city to take on the debt\nservice.\n\nMaya Wiley Wiley would support municipal control of the MTA if it meant the City\nwould also control its revenue stream, as well as bridge and tunnel\nrevenue.\n\nAndrew Y ang Y ang would call for full municipal control of the operations of the\n\nsubways and buses.\n\nFernando Mateo Mateo supports NY C gaining control of its subway and bus systems,\nprovided the city also gains full control of bridge and tunnel toll\nrevenue.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 https://www.mateothemayor.com/post/action-plan-to-revive-nyc-hospitality-industry\n11\n{11935670:1}",

AAR Service operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days\na year within the five boroughs of New Y ork City and within a 3/4-mile corridor beyond fixed-\nroute service across the NY C borderline to nearby areas of Nassau and Westchester counties.\n\nThere is a shared-ride program (customers may ride with other customers), origin-to-destination\nservice or feeder service for eligible customers, and non-priority trips with maximum ride times\nbased on trip distance. Services are provided by private carriers who contract with NYC Transit\nand use lift- equipped vans or sedans. In addition, service is also provided by private taxis, livery,\nand black car services.\n\nAccording to the MTA, over the past 10 years, demand for paratransit trips has “skyrocketed from\napproximately 20,000 per day in 2008, to over 30,000 currently (pre-pandemic).”** Prior to the\npandemic, the allocation of AAR trips was approximately 30% dedicated and 70% non-\ndedicated.** The new contract will reduce the average cost the MTA pays for the brokered trips\nfrom $34 to $31, which is less than one-half of the $83 per trip cost for dedicated service trips.\nThe agency is planning to shift 75% of trips to brokers over the next three years. The MTA\nestimates the new contracts could save the agency more than $85 million over the course of the\ncontract.\n\nIn September 2012, New Y ork City started the A ccessible Dispatch Program (“ADP”), an initiative\nthat provides wheelchair-accessible taxi dispatching services to disabled residents of, and visitors\nto, New Y ork City, and it blossomed.*° ADP was meant to alleviate the problems with AAR and\nthe lack of accessible taxis in the City’s fleet. A private dispatch company vendor was awarded\nthe city contract to dispatch accessible taxicabs to locations within Manhattan. The ADP is now a\ncentralized service providing on-demand transportation continually. There are multiple ways to\nbook a taxi from the ADP, including calling 311, calling or sending a text message to the dispatch\ncenter directly, using the ADP app, or booking online. Drivers are compensated for drive time\nfrom the point they accept the request until the customer is dropped off, but ADP customers pay\nonly the metered taxi fare for the time they are in the vehicle.\n\n3° https://www.mta.info/sites/default/files/mtaimgs/fast_forward_the_plan_to_modernize_nyct.pdf\n31 https://gothamist.com/news/infographic-how-much-nyc-subway-accessible\n32 https://new.mta.info/document/15711\n3 Id,\n34 Id,\n35 See Daus and Mischel (2014).\n17\n{11935670:1}",

Congestion Pricing\n\nIn 2019, the New York State Legislature passed a congestion pricing law that was initially\nprojected to be implemented in the beginning of 2021, but has not yet materialized. Early proposals\nfor congestion pricing put recommended prices of $12 to $14 for cars and $25 for trucks, and a\nJune 2020 study from Cornell University found that $20 toll for entering Manhattan below 60th\nStreet could reduce air pollution by 40% in New Y ork City. Congestion tolls were estimated to\ngenerate $1 billion in annual revenue to help fund MTA construction work. For every $1 billion\nexpected in toll revenue per year, the MTA can obtain $5 billion in bonding over the next three\nyears.\n\nBecause the roads that would be tolled receive federal funding, the Federal Highway\nAdministration (“FHWA”) required an environmental review before New York State could\nimplement congestion pricing. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of guidance from\nfederal regulators on the type of environmental review that was required (full environmental\nimpact statement or abbreviated assessment) caused the project to be stalled. In March 2021, the\nBiden administration informed the MTA that it could submit an environmental assessment instead\nof an environmental impact statement — a welcome development for proponents of congestion\npricing.\n\nHowever, politically difficult decisions will have to be made before the tolling infrastructure can\nbe installed. The 2019 law stipulated that the board of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority\n(TBTA) would determine the charges and exemptions, credits, or discounts for any group of\ndrivers, including taxis and ride-hailing vehicles.

The report also found\nthat the FHV fleet had tripled from under 40,000 vehicles in 2010 to more than 120,000 vehicles\nin 2019, and greenhouse gas emissions from TLC-regulated fleets had grown 62% from 2013 to\n2018.

Intercity Bus Curb Space Management\nIntercity buses are one of the most standard and longstanding forms of shared mobility. The bus\nindustry has expanded and has become an increasingly popular option for commuters and those\ntraveling into New Y ork City from other cities like Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the past few years, the intercity bus industry has evolved to provide dynamic scheduling and\npricing that gets people where they want to go, when they want to go there. It has also simplified\nthe booking and boarding process through customer-friendly apps. Some companies offer free Wi-\nFi and onboard entertainment so riders can relax or work while they travel. Technology is making\nit easier for new companies to compete with the larger established carriers.\n\nThese buses provide a low-cost, useful transportation option and alternative to personal vehicles,\nbut they can cause disruption to the local traffic network through increased sidewalk and street\ncongestion and heavy usage of the City’s curb space.* From a policy standpoint, local\ntransportation departments generally support privately operated buses as a form of mass transit for\ncommuters because it reduces vehicular traffic and moves more people more efficiently than\ndriving alone.** From a quality of life perspective, urban community residents generally oppose\nan influx of buses idling on the already crowded and possibly diminishing curb space outside their\nhomes and businesses.\n\nTo manage the curb space and counter balance the negatives, New York City Department of\nTransportation (“NYC DOT”) is authorized by State and local law to implement a Bus Stop Permit\nsystem to regulate where buses may pick-up and drop-off passengers in the City.®4 Permits are\nrequires for intercity buses, sightseeing buses, and shuttle buses. Charter buses, school buses, buses\nlicensed by NYC TLC, MTA buses, and buses operating pursuant to a contract or franchise\nagreement with New Y ork City do not need permits, but must follow all applicable rules and laws.\n\nThe NYC DOT’s Bus Stop Permit system requires owners or operators to apply for a permit from\nNYC DOT before they can make on-street pick-ups or drop-offs in the City. The permit approval\nprocess includes consultation with local community boards and other agencies such as the MTA\nand Port Authority of New Y ork and New Jersey, where appropriate, ensuring the involvement of\nstakeholders in the process.®\n\n% https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/ferrybus/intercity-bus.shtml\n93 www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-car-free-cities.html\n\n54 N.Y.

Beyond that, said Ward, “the region needs to develop small, clean\nvehicles capable of carrying freight the last mile from rail stations to final destinations.”\nSpecifically, there are several problems in New Y ork City.\n\nAlthough bus and truck routes have been designated, lax traffic enforcement has allowed\nlimousines, taxis and trucks to illegally block dedicated bus lanes at evening rush hours in key\nmidtown intersections for as long as 15 minutes without being ticketed.\n\nCandidate Positions on Truck & Freight Delivery\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCandidate Position\n\nEric Adams N/A\n\nShaun Donovan Donovan supports exploring ways to reallocate the curb so it can better\nserve the City’s increasing use of them.\n\nKathryn Garcia To support climate goals, Garcia would Implement a zero-interest loan\nprogram to help small businesses to buy small-scale, electric,\n\n \n\n96 https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/taxirelief.shtml\n57 https://www.utrc2.org/sites/default/files/pubs/Mayoral-Transportation-White-Paper.pdf\n8 Id.\n39\n{11935670:1}",

Currently, the City has more than 2,700 electric vehicles\n(“EVs”) in its services. Near term emissions reductions will be achieved by implementing\nrenewable diesel fuel, accelerating the transition to EV and hybrid vehicles, and increasing the\nefficiency of the fleet, which will help reduce the City’s fuel consumption to below 2014 levels.\nLonger term reductions will rely on the 100% clean electricity grid planned by New Y ork State\nand encouraging technological advances for emergency response and heavy vehicles.\n\nBy 2050, the City aims to have 20% of new vehicle registrations be for EVs. Towards this end,\nthe Mayor’s Office of Sustainability is partnering with the NYC DOT to install electric vehicle\ncharging stations throughout the City. A key part of this initiative is a $10 billion investment to\ninstall fast charging stations (full charge in 30 minutes) in every borough. The City's goal is to\nhave 50 fast-charging stations citywide by 2020. Through the NY Cx Climate Action Challenge,\nthe City will launch a first-in-the-nation pilot to outfit light poles with chargers, initially focusing\non City fleet vehicles, with a potential for future expansion. The City will work with the City\nCouncil to pass legislation to strengthen requirements on new parking lots to support EVs.

Micromobility: Bikes, Scooters & Mopeds\n\nMicromobility devices, including powered standing scooters (e-scooters) and electric bicycles,\namong other nimble motorized devices, have gained popularity in recent years due to advances in\nvehicle and communication technologies. Shared micromobility allows individuals to rent a bike\nor scooter on a short-term basis by using a mobile application (app). Through the app, a user can\nlocate a bike or scooter, unlock the device, and pay for the trip. When users are finished, they leave\nthe bike or scooter in a designated docking station or, if the device is “dockless,” in a designated\narea.\n\nMicromobility is changing how people travel. According to the National Association of City\nTransportation Officials (“NACTO”), people took 136 million trips on shared bikes and scooters\nin 2019, which is a 60% increase from 2018.'°4 Some “speculate that micromobility is only at its\nbeginning of the exponential innovation and growth curve.”!

And when he was beaten by police in the basement\nof a precinct house at 15, Eric faced a life-changing act of injustice.\n\nBut instead of giving into anger, Eric turned his pain into purpose and decided to change the police\ndepartment from within. He joined the NYPD and became one of its most outspoken officers,\ncalling out racism and bias in the department and pushing for major reforms.\n\nAsa founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, Eric would often police the streets in\na bulletproof vest one day during the high-crime 1980’s and 1990’s and protest bad behavior by\ncops the next, marching side-by-side with his fellow civil rights advocates. He rose to the rank of\ncaptain, helping to build the first computerized system for tracking crime in the city, which led to\nhistoric gains in public safety.\n\nEric’s efforts to change policing began his lifelong work to improve and protect New York. From\nthe NYPD, he moved on to the State Senate, where he represented sections of central and\nBrownstone Brooklyn. In Albany, Eric built winning coalitions to advance New York City’s values\n\n59\n{11935670:1}",

He also became the first person of color to chair the Senate’s Homeland Security\nCommittee.\n\nEric was then elected Brooklyn Borough President in 2013 by putting together a diverse coalition\nof Brooklynites to become the borough’s first Black leader. As the representative of one of the\nnation’s largest counties, Eric fought tirelessly to grow the local economy, invest in schools, reduce\ninequality, improve public safety, and advocate for smart policies and better government that\ndelivers for all New Yorkers. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck the city, Eric moved a\nmattress into his office and worked around the clock to deliver donated meals and PPE to essential\nworkers and vulnerable New Y orkers, demanding government produce more equitable relief.\n\nIn addition to continuing to fight for struggling New Y orkers and a better quality of life for all,\nEric became a national leader on public health policy after learning he had developed Type 2\ndiabetes. Following his diagnosis, Eric completely changed his diet and his body, reversing the\ndisease and launching a personal mission to educate New Y orkers about preventative care and\nwellness. His work has already led to successful proactive public health efforts across the city and\nincreased education in schools and with high-risk populations in lower-income areas, partnering\nwith civic organizations and health experts.\n\nEric is a lifelong New Yorker. He received his master’s degree in public administration from\nMarist College, and is a graduate of New Y ork City Technical College and the John Jay College\nof Criminal Justice.

Campaign Website Bio\nRaised by a single mother and his grandparents in Dayton, Ohio, Ray McGuire and his two brothers\ndidn’t have much growing up. But they had family, faith, church, a loving home and a deep-seated\nbelief that education was their ticket to anywhere.\n\n“T never knew my father. He never acknowledged me, a sorrow I share with far too many in the\nneighborhood.”\n\nEven without a father, family was everything to Ray. His mother, Wiletha McGuire, was, and to\nthis day is, a powerful force in Ray’s life. When she wasn’t taking care of their family she worked\nas a social worker.\n\nRay saw his grandfather working in a factory during the week, as a janitor on the weekends and\nserving as the head deacon in his church. His grandmother was the head of the church missionary\nboard. His grandparents tried to “save souls through faith.” Through his mother and grandparents\nRay absorbed the values of working hard, believing in yourself and looking out for other people\nwho need a hand along the way.\n\nWhen a 5th grade teacher saw something special in Ray, he got a scholarship and his family dug\ndeep, sacrificed and borrowed money so Ray could go to a better school. Every day, Ray walked\na mile or so and took a bus to get to a school where few others looked like him.\n\n“By 11th grade, I was president of the student council, had a 4.0 GPA and was averaging 28.0\npoints a game on the basketball team (solid form, decent elevation, slight reluctance to pass).”\n\n74\n{11935670:1}",
    "Page_81": "When a teacher challenged Ray by saying, “If you are as good as they say you are, why don’t you\ngo test yourself against the big girls and boys in the East?” Ray, then 16, took a plane by himself\nto Connecticut. From there, he took a Greyhound bus trying to find a place “to test himself” and\nget a better education. With another scholarship, more student loans and more borrowed money,\nRay decided on Hotchkiss, one of the best prep schools in the country.\n\nRay went on to Harvard, becoming the first in his family to graduate from college. He then enrolled\nina four-yearJD/MBA program at Harvard. A fter earning degrees in law and business at the same\ntime, Ray went to New Y ork fora job on Wall Street.\n\n“T couldn’t afford a place to live in the city, but a friend’s parents let me stay at their apartment\nwhile they were away. They didn’t charge me, but I had to pay all the utilities so, needless to say,\nI spent a lot of time with the lights off.”\n\nLike so many New Yorkers, Ray came to New Y ork wide-eyed with a mix of hope and fear,\nconfidence and doubt. From day one, Ray knew New Y ork City was where he wanted to build a\nbetter life for himself, but he didn’t know how to make it all happen. He was awed and inspired\nby the city’s energy. For a kid from a small city in Ohio, the sheer size and speed of New York\nwas intimidating. Ray felt like an outsider and, in the business he was going into, he was an\noutsider.\n\n“Almost no one in Wall Street corporate finance looked like me. I was reminded of what my\nmother and grandparents would say to me—that I had to work twice as hard to be considered half\nas good. I was one of the first but, since then, I made sure I was never the only.”\n\nOver the last 36 years, Ray has led businesses responsible for generating $20+ billion a year in\nrevenue supporting public and private sector clients around the world. He recruited and built teams\nto do multi-billion-dollar deals, and he advised the CEOs of companies on how to help their\nbusinesses grow, thrive and create jobs.\n\nFor the last 13 years, he was the head of global corporate and investment banking at Citigroup and\nthe longest tenured head of investment banking in the history of Wall Street. Ray has personally\noriginated and executed deals valued at over $650 billion while he also worked to make a\ndifference.\n\nAs a Citi Foundation Board member, Ray helped the firm improve the lives of people in low-\nincome communities. He also recently helped write a groundbreaking report on the economic\nimpact of systemic racism. Throughout his career, Ray has served as a mentor to the next\ngeneration of corporate and civic leaders in New Y ork. By mentoring people, Ray has held the\ndoor open for many others including those who grew up like him.\n\n“T’ve been a have and I’ve been a have not. Today, I’m proud to be able to give back to my city\nand I feel fortunate to serve on a number of civic, charitable and educational institutions.”\n\nWhen Ray wasn’t working, he was giving back to kids in New York City by contributing to their\neducational opportunities. For 30 years, Ray has been on the board of the De La Salle Academy.\n\n75\n{11935670:1}",
    "Page_82": "This small, independent day school primarily serves gifted students, many who live below the\npoverty line. Many of these kids commute every day, mostly by taking public transportation and\nsometimes for hours.\n\n“They run the gauntlet of detractors and doubters back in the community, just like I did. I’m sure\nthey hear their friends say they’II never make it, like mine did.”\n\nRay has also given back to the city he loves by serving on the boards of the New Y ork Presbyterian\nHospital, the New Y ork Public Library, the Whitney Museum and the Studio Museum in Harlem.\nHe has also served on advisory boards for the Council of Urban Professionals, Sponsors for\nEducational Opportunities, Management Leadership for Tomorrow and others throughout the city.\n\nNow, Ray is running for mayor to lead the city’s recovery as it deals with the loss of one million\njobs and one in three businesses. Ray also knows the city was facing many problems even before\nthis pandemic, and he wants to use his experience to help rebuild our economy and improve the\nlives of every New Y orker.\n\n“New York is the greatest city on earth, but it is a city at risk—grave risk. The danger lights are\nflashing red. We’re facing a financial crisis unlike any the city has seen before. Too many kids\nwho look like me or grew up like I did can’t make it. Too many people are out of work. No jobs.\nNo city. I’m running because the same old political answers won’t fix that.”\n\nRay knows that racial and social justice are long overdue, and that New Y ork has an opportunity\nto lead by example. He believes that a city built on diversity can be a city that leads the way on\ninclusion, opportunity and success. Ray knows we must address bad policing and rethink our\napproach to public safety while we also tackle inequities in housing, health and the myriad of other\nsystemic issues holding New Y orkers back.\n\n“Like so many other people in our city, I can wear a suit and be seen as a successful businessman\nin the eyes of the law. But, if ’m walking home from playing basketball with my children, I could\neasily be the next George Floyd. The fight for social and racial justice is one I take very seriously.”\n\nWith the COVID-19 crisis magnifying all of the city’s challenges and creating an economic crisis\nlike none other, some are suggesting, “New York is over.” Ray thinks they are wrong. And he is\nready to prove it by using his experience to rebuild our city’s economy, spark innovation, create\nand attract new jobs and still make the city more affordable and more equitable.\n\nH.

As a Bed-Stuy native, single mother and proud daughter of Puerto Rican\nparents, Dianne understands our city’s systems, from public housing to public schools. Dianne’s\nmother was an office manager for the leather workers’ union, and her father was a 32BJ member\nand former building manager on the Brooklyn waterfront, the area now known as DUMBO. They\nlived in NY CHA, and little Dianne was often the translator for her Abuela Rosa, who shared a\nroom and a bed with Dianne. Dianne’s family was a part of a community — a village — that\nlooked out for one another because the City failed to provide the basics their neighborhood needed.\nHer family taught her to lift as you climb. Even as an adult, this fight didn’t end: A mother of two\nchildren with learning differences, Dianne sued the City’s public school system to get the resources\nher daughter needed to learn effectively.\n\nDianne is the only former NYC public school teacher in this race — and that matters. Dianne\nknows firsthand how segregated schools have divided young people based on race, income and\nZIP code. It’s for this very reason Dianne has committed her entire career to meeting the needs of\nour fellow neighbors.\n\nShe is the former Executive Director of The Door, where she launched a street outreach program\non the Christopher St. Pier for homeless LGBTQ + youth that expanded to create a drop-in program\n\n84\n{11935670:1}",

Campaign Website Bio\nA LIFETIME OF EX PERIENCE UNIQUELY PREPARES SCOTT STRINGER TO LEAD NEW\nYORK CITY OUT OF CRISIS.\n\nAs City Comptroller, Scott Stringer has exposed waste and mismanagement in every city agency.\nHe has overseen growth in the City’s $240-billion pension funds, the fourth largest in the nation,\nto record levels. He took on the private prison industry and the world’s largest fossil fuel\ncompanies, advancing the causes of climate justice and decarceration. He forced corporations\nacross America to diversify their boardrooms. His plans for a comprehensive city-run childcare\nprogram would make New Y ork the national leader. And over the last year, every step of the way,\nhe’s pushed Bill de Blasio to fix the City’s response to COVID-19.\n\nBut long before Scott Stringer was the City of New York’s chief financial officer, he was a kid\nfrom Washington Heights.\n\nBorn and raised in a rent-regulated apartment at 1 Bogardus Place, by his mom, Arlene, a City\nschool teacher, and later his stepfather, Carlos Cuevas, Scott is a proud graduate of New Y ork City\npublic schools and CUNY — P.S. 152, J.H.S. 52, John F. Kennedy High School, and John Jay\nCollege.\n\nScott began his career in public service as an aide to then-Assemblymember Jerry Nadler and\ntenant organizer on the Upper West Side. He was elected to the State Assembly in 1992, where he\nmade waves fighting against George Pataki’s tax cuts for the wealthy and standing up to leaders\nof his own party to protect tenants’ rights. Scott was arrested protesting the police murder of\nAmadou Diallo, passed a landmark anti-stalking law to protect victims of domestic violence, was\n\n92\n{11935670:1}",

He\ncreated “School Overcrowding War Rooms” and forced the Department of Education to build new\nschools. He helped launch the campaign against fracking in New Y ork State, worked to reduce\nfood insecurity and asthma rates in East Harlem, fought for more protected bike lanes and stronger\ntraffic enforcement, and was an early and outspoken critic of the NYPD’s use of stop-and-frisk.\n\nElected City Comptroller in 2013 after an upset victory over former Governor Eliot Spitzer, Scott\nhas overseen growth in New Y ork City’s pension funds from $147 billion to $240 billion. He\noverhauled the back office of the pension funds, instituted new ethics, risk management, and\ncompliance practices, banned “placement agents,” and aligned fees paid to investment advisors\nwith their performance on behalf of city workers and retirees.\n\nUnder Scott’s leadership, the Comptroller’s office has audited every city agency, saving millions\nof taxpayer dollars and improving city services. His investigations have exposed unsafe and\ndeplorable conditions at homeless shelters and public housing, forcing much-needed\nimprovements. His creation of ClaimStat, a tool to transparently analyze claims against the City\nand encourage agencies to improve their practices, has already saved taxpayers tens of millions of\ndollars. And he has been a consistent voice for responsible budgeting and long-term planning,\ncalling for more savings from City Hall to better prepare for fiscal downturns.\n\nAt the same time, Scott led New York City’s pension funds to make the historic decision to divest\n$4 billion from the fossil fuel industry. Scott was called “one of the strongest voices for climate\naction in the financial sector” by Bill McKibben, a founder of the climate advocacy group 350.org\nand a leader of fossil fuel divestment efforts. And he has used the power of the pension funds to\ndiversify boardrooms across America and strengthen corporate governance at Fortune 500\ncompanies.\n\nBuilding on his decades of activism against systemic racism in the criminal justice system, Scott\nalso led the pension funds to divest from the private prison industry. He has published detailed\nplans to end the criminalization of poverty, reinvest police dollars in communities, and transform\nthe City’s approach to public safety, and was the first citywide official to call for the closure of the\njail on Rikers Island.\n\nScott has brought his commitment to tenants’ rights and affordable housing to the Comptroller’s\noffice, opposing rezonings that would increase displacement pressures on longtime residents and\nauditing NY CHA more times than all previous Comptrollers combined. He has put out detailed\nplans to create a land bank and use vacant lots to create permanently affordable housing, refocus\nthe City’s investments on low-income housing, and require affordability in every new\ndevelopment.\n\n93\n{11935670:1}",
